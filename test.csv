4,"This is my favorite restaurant in the valley. I moved away 5 years ago, and every time I visit I have to return for the Stetson Salad and Mushroom Pan Fry.  I love that the ambiance is casual - you can wear jeans, if you want - but the food is delicious, and they offer a wine to please anyone."
2,"So if you buy a bottle of wine here, their is no presentation.  Apparently all wine tastes the same to these people.  If your gonna sell wine, know how, don't tell me you don't know what the wine tastes like.  Buy the way, I work at a restaurant too."
2,"China Mama is fighting for their three stars with me. More things disappoint me about this place than impress me on more reasons than one.\n\nThe restaurant as a whole is a nice place and the staff was very friendly with my family. When I opened the menu, I saw the prices of the items on the menu. Personally, I think the prices of the items on the menu are a little high. My family ordered vegetable chow mien, vegetable fried rice, braised tofu (I think), crispy beef, and sweet and sour fish fillet. When the chow mien, fried rice, and braised tofu came out, I personally thought that we could have gotten a little more food or the prices could be a little less, but I like large amounts of food in front of me. I did enjoy the fried rice and chow mien though, I thought they were cooked really well. These two would justify a higher rating in this review, but the crispy beef and sweet & sour fish fillet brought the rating down. The crispy beef was good and so was the sweet & sour fish fillet, but they put too much sauce in both and it was too sweet. In the crispy beef, about half was beef and half was carrots, which was a turn off, and then it was paired with too much sauce that was sweet. The sweet and sour fish fillet had even more sauce than the crispy beef did and it was too sweet. When you got to the fish after wiping all that sauce inside of your mouth, the fish was delicious, but I couldn't get past the large amount of sauce and the sweetness of it. I don't believe you can ask for sauce on the side for the crispy beef, but the sweet and sour fish, you most definitely should. \n\nThis isn't a bad Chinese place to eat at, just don't order something sweet and sour unless you put the sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you put yourself. The prices may be a little high, but the food does taste good. In the end, the decision is in your hands."

1,"So I was on a date with my husband and the service good. We left a great tip for our waiter. As we were leaving I needed to use the restroom. as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean.  Than another worker comes in and they began to talk about another worker that just got hired and why the manager is thinking about promoting her and she just start working there. That's not that worst part. One of the workers leave out and and one stays in. The one that stays in is sweeping the floor. While I'm in the middle stall she sweeps my jeans and immediately apologize. IM PISSED!!!!! My question is why are you sweeping in stall #2 when you are in stall #1. That tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing.  So I come out to was my hands and notice that my pants were wet. I also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign. The young lady was in the 3rd stall sweeping so while washing my hands I said to her \""dis you just sweep my jeans with that dirty ass broom\"" she says I said I'm sorry I say what is your name she says I said I was sorry I say I didn't ask for an apology I asked for you name. She doesn't say anything so I walk into the stalk that she is sweeping in and ask for her name again and she REPEATS herself and says I'm sorry.  Now I'm irritated and ask why she won't give me her name she meekly says ALYSSA. I walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager. \n\nIT GETS WORST......\n\nI asked for a manager and I got a manager I don't believe she gave me her name neither do I remember asking.  However I do remember that as she walked up  with ALYSSA telling \""her side of the story\"" the manger was very defensive when I told her what happened in the restroom.  The manager wanted to know WHY was the employees name so important to me and if she was wearing a name tag why did I need the employee to tell me. I explained that ALYSSA was inside of a restroom stall and I could not see her until I walked into the stall. The manger than told me that ALYSSA was intimidated my me and she was on the verge of crying. I said well I'm sorry this is her job she works around PEOPLE everyday I don't care about her crying she swept my jeans with a dirty ass broom. The manager said well I talk to her. I looked at her dead in her eyes and said I JUST SPENT OVER $100 IN THIS PLACE TO BE TREATED THIS WAY. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! \n\nTHE SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT THE MANAGER WHO WAS THERE ON OCTOBER 17, 2014 ABOUT 10 PM YOU SHOULD TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WAY BETTER."

0,"I have been a customer of Ulta for  years, I did not realize how over priced they are, recently I bought a Clairol spin brush for $59.99 at Ulta, two day later I was shopping at Walmart and noticed it was $15.00 cheaper I can't believe the price difference.  I can see maybe $5.00 but $15.00 is a lot of money.  I wrote to Ulta and basically they said too bad so sad and they didn't seem to care.  They did however thank me for being such a loyal customer, well needless to say that is over. Not only are they overprice but they don't seem to care"
1,"Style over substance.  \n\nAll looks and poor food quality.  The keyword would be OLD.  Everything tasted stale or had a weird skin on it from age, including the smoked salmon, all the pastries.  Very poor fruit options nothing remotely exotic or fun.  Maybe we came on a bad day but either way we felt like it was highway robbery.  Left the place hungry because nothing tasted was fresh.  Very strange because we came at 9am, its hard to imagine food sitting around for too long that early in the day.  Probably all from the day before.  Doh.\n\nThe omelets weren't bad."
3,"Caribbean Jerk Chicken and Full Montagu.\nEffin' great.  It's VEGAS and in a CASINO, so the price isn't amazing...  but still worth a trip every time you visit LV.  Now open 24 hours so you can get your fix after a drunken night in the club!\n\nTheir sandwiches don't need the steak sauce, but definitely go well together.\n\nAs a side note: try their sandwiches only.  A friend had a wrap and said it was nothing special.  I DEFINITEL thought my sandwiches were special...  so stick to the basics!"

3,"Lunch was good! Made the mistake of asking what was in the Italian combo sandwich though... The reply in a strong NY accent: \""Don't ask questions like that when you come to a NY deli\"" I laughed and ordered the Sandwich. He never told me what was in it but I had a good idea...\n\nThis is a nice location and has both inside and patio seating. I decided to sit inside because the patio was pretty crowded. Good buzz in this place. It was fun listening to the guy at the counter greet people.\n\nMy sandwich was good and really liked the bread. I will definitely go back and probably try the meatball sandwich next. As I was leaving, I saw the guy making one and it looked pretty good. Rinaldi's definitely has some big balls!?!?!?!!? Wait, That didn't come out right...\n\nGive this place a shot... I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,Very responsive and reliable. Thank you to Bim & his crew!
2,"I was here on a Sunday night and boy, it was CROWDED!I had people breathing down my neck. their sweat dripping all over mine, and I could barely move; let alone dance...It was an event night with guest star \""Afrojacks.\"" \n\nThe drinks were overpriced ($16 for patron shots, $9 beers, and $14 glass of red wine), and the service was okay. A fight broke out that night near the bathroom area so I couldn't even go to the restroom for an hour. I had to exit the club to use the restroom near one of the restaurants and then reenter. \n\nTips:\n1. Come before midnight so you won't have a problem getting in.\n2. There are tons of promoters on the strip after 5PM that you can go to for free admission cards which includes one free drink per person. Just walk around the strip, you're bound to bump into at least one. **THIS ONLY APPLIES IF YOUR GROUP IS ALL GIRLS**They give you a ticket voucher at the door for your free drink."
0,"I tried this pizza on a Sunday afternoon.  The price was reasonable and the delivery was quick.  The staff member on the phone was polite.  However, the taste was very lackluster.  I have tasted frozen pizzas that taste better."
1,"I used to love Cork, and I've wanted to continue to love it, but the last vew visits have demonstrated a massive decline in the level of service.\n\nI've been probably 6 or 8 times in the past year, and only half the time did we receive the quality of service that I felt thier price point warranted.\n\nMost recently, I took a new friend there for brunch for the first time. By the end of the meal we were both in a terrible mood, our waitress had sucked so bad. Examples:\n\n* After sitting down, it took the waitress a full 15 minutes before taking our order. It took another full half hour for the food to arrive! Yes, they were busy, but there were empty tables too. Other people who arrived after us had their orders taken quickly (they had the best waiter there) and were already paying thier tab & leaving at the time our food arrived. \n* My date had to ask 3 times for cream & sweetener for his coffee: it finally arrived 15 minutes later. When the coffee was cold. (Glad I drink mine black!)\n* Our food arrived cold.\n* He ordered wheat toast w/his meal. The waitress didn't bring the toast until he was nearly done eating, and when plopping it down - white toast - simply stated \""We're out of wheat\"", then split. \n* I ordered a biscuit w/my meal. It was tooth-breakingly hard, like a hockey puck.\n* The waiters typically offer freshly ground pepper; this waitress did not. In fact she brought no condiments at all to the table - no butter, jelly, nothing.. When we asked for salt and pepper, she simply plopped a salt shaker - no pepper - on the table and hurried away. \n\nBecause I have been there many times and the manager recognizes me, I spoke to him about the service. Before I could even say much of anything; he immediately launched into, \""I know the service could have been better, we're having an off day, a few people called in sick, we're short-handed, blah blah blah\"" It was all a big whine of excuses. You know what, their being shortstaffed didn't cause our waitress to be shitty, her attitude did. And if they were truly shorthanded then why wasn't his lazy ass helping out? All I saw him doing through our entire meal-ordeal was leaning on the bar & yukking it up w/other workers who also didn't seem to have much to do. \n\nThankfully, most of their food continues to be delicious, that's a plus. And if you get their very best waiter (wish I remembered his name; he's worked there since day 1), then it's an awesome dining experience.\n\nI live walking distance, so I'll likely return at some point, but for folks who live a ways away, might as well steer clear."
0,"I've been a member for over 2 years now. At first, I loved the change from the usual local gym. The instructors were awesome! They were happy and amazing. However the past 6 months or so, the studio has lost it's appeal. And the soap in the bathrooms. Wth, isn't that a health code violation?! The signs that are up asking for tips to keep the instructors are also tacky. Too bad too. This was a perfect location and atmosphere."
0,"Went there and arrived @6:30 and the shop closes at 7:00.  Was told that they had no time to give me a haircut.  Have to admit that I have never been somewhere that if you arrived before closing would not try to accommodate you.  Must be an appointment only facility, can't say that I would recommend."
4,"My wife and I went to Red Rock for our honeymoon. While looking for some exciting things to do we saw a advertisement on a cab top light for \""FULL AUTO.\"" Anyway, I yelped it, and explained to her that I read other yelp reviews where people took their wives here and had a good time, and that it wasn't just for dudes. She agreed to go and man did we have a blast. \n\nNeither of us ever shot guns before, so it was exhilarating. She went with the coalition package and I went with the Terminator package (features guns from the movie) and also added a AK-47. \n\nThe instructor was funny and explained to us in fairly brief detail on how to use everything, and did a pretty awesome job of calming us down and making us feel comfortable with his comedy routine. Wifey went first and her expression was priceless after she shot a 9mm for the first time. We were allowed to take photos of us brandishing the weapons after shooting since we purchased the VIP pass. \n\nI am so proud that my wife can say she shot a M249 SAW, and I have the video to prove it. After that we went to the pinball hall of fame, still pumped on adrenaline. Fucking awesome experience. Anyone who goes to Vegas should try this at least once in a lifetime. Your cash is way better spent here than at a slot machine, trust me."

4,"Being a southerner I know good BBQ. Finding good BBQ in the north has been a challenge til now. Union Pig and Chicken is outstanding!  We had the brisket, chicken, Mac and cheese, and cheese grits. EVERY bite of it was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband has never been a fan if cheese grits until he had the ones here. The portions are big-even if you are a hearty eater. The wait staff is very nice. We will definitely be back to try to ribs."
1,"Buyer beware @ Sugar Factory! Our group went to sugar factory over MDW and had an interesting experience to say the least.\n\nFirst thing we heard from our server once we sat down was that everything on the menu was $1 MORE than listed! I thought she was kidding...she was not. The restaurant actually had the balls to up charge every single item $1 over their busiest weekend of the year. Like their prices weren't high enough for what you got.\n\nI am pretty sure this is illegal and the manager eventually voided out the extra $'s once we complained...but still made for a bad experience.\n\nThe food is mediocre at best, nothing to write home about. Out of our fairly large group, no one loved their food, no one hated it. Drinks were overpriced, and really so was the food for the quality and portions they gave. We were excited to try the mac n cheese pops, but were very disappointed. Cheaply breaded mac n cheese, looked like a corn dog. Do yourself a favor and go to Society Cafe to try these...WAY better.\n\nOur server was great, she took care of the table well, was funny and attentive...so that's really the only reason I gave 2 stars.\n\nWe don't plan on coming back to Sugar Factory...they are shady to say the least."
3,"I have been to FEZ twice now, when passing through Phoenix. First, the decor is amazing, an oasis of urbanity amid the heat and sprawl of Phoenix. Excellent lighting and decoration. And I love the food, a mix of Mediterranean and American fare. This last time, I had a grilled-chicken sandwich with pomegranate vinaigrette, goat cheese, sliced pears, dried cherries, and field greens on ciabatta. My dinner companions had different sandwiches, and all were good, but one of my companions said he thought his sandwich was just a tad over-sauced. The sweet-potato fries were a real treat. I plan to make FEZ a regular stop when I travel through Phoenix again."
4,"Friday April 26, 2007, Friday Night Maxim Party at Tryst\n\nAmazing venue. As of that date, Tryst was easily the most impressive club in Vegas, hands down. My date and I had a table right on the edge of the dance floor and the water. Perfect view of the waterfall. We used Nick at www.vipnvegas.com for our VIP arrangements and the arrangements were immaculate. Bouncers were super friendly. There was a 3 hour line and we stood in the VIP line for roughly, 1 minute before being escorted all the way in to the club. Amazing sights, spacious pools, great drinks and we met so many great people. This place really set the tone for our Vegas trip. Our drinks were well watched and the hostesses treated us like royalty. The music was on hit and the people, the weather, everything was BEAUTIFUL. :) \n\nSince then Ive been back a few times. Always good times. Its been since 2009 since Ive been. Its time for a visit real soon!"

0,"Food court location at Arrowhead mall.  Way overpriced for what they serve.  1 slice, 1 side (very small potatoes), and 1 drink was around $7and that's a meal combo \""deal\"".  I know it's the mall, but I can do a lot better for $7.  It was very unappealing to see them carefully weigh the side portion of potatoes - OMG don't accidentally give me one potato chunk too many! loss of profits!!\n\nService was rather friendly on my visit, and perhaps it was because someone seeming to be in a managerial role was working \""the line\"". \n\nProbably everyone has had a slice of sbarro and there's nothing special to write home about.  Side potatoes were a little too oily.  Mall crowd is lame, even though I admit I'm part of the crowd if I'm there.\n\nI'm still miffed about the $7 \""deal\"".  I'll go to a local place next time."
2,"Nothing special about this place. The food was acceptable, nothing more.  The service was slow..friendly but slow.  The patio looks like a place old furniture goes to die.  And it's in the middle of NO WHERE.  It's for a specific type of crowd for sure."
1,Went here a few weeks ago with a large party. Waiters and waitresses just could not get it together. About 20 minutes after we all ordered a different waiter than the one who actually took our order came by and asked us what we had ordered. -_______- It was like that throughout the whole dinner. It just seemed very unorganized. Service was slow and they kept forgetting a bunch of stuff. ***and when I say a large party I'm talking about 9 or 10 adults and 5 small children.
2,"Often rated as one of the best buffets in Vegas, I think they get those reviews due to the size of the buffet.  It's IMMENSE!  Everything you could possibly want.  The food was just meh, though.  I've had better quality food at Golden Corral.  I did like the sushi, although the selection was lacking.  All of the food was good -- didn't have anything that was bad, just nothing that really stood out.  Considering the price of food in the Vegas Strip area, though, $25 wasn't bad for as much food as they have on the menu."
0,"Honestly, I am so so so disappointed in this take over from Darque Tan. I actually wrote Palm Beach a personalized letter about their staff ,  the horrible service and HORRIBLE products.... I have YET to hear back...\n\nI use the versa spa tanning which I am not sure why the solution they switched to requires me to literally tan three to four times in a row to get the color I want. I have asked the people that work there why this is and been told \""its much more natural looking\"". No. Its not. It doesnt even look like I got tanned AT ALL. I am paying 50-60 bucks a month for a tanning membership, I would expect to look tan after one time. Also, I lost my ring there and their new policy about having to come into the store to discuss this is insane but I did it anyways and the girl told me she \""had no clue where the lost and found was kept and I would have to come back later when someone else was working\"".  Great, thanks for all your help.\n\n\nI was soo pleased with Darque Tan I am so sad that Palm Beach has taken over and that the  product and service they provide has gone so down hill.\n\nI cant spread the word enough about how NOT to pick this tanning place to all my friends and family."

2,"Eh, it was just okay.  I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just wasn't what everyone cracked it up to be.  \n\nThe chips weren't warm, and the salsas all tasted the same.  \n\nThe chile rellenos (I had the cheese and also the beef stuffed rellenos) are not even worth rating as average.  They were severely undercooked, and normally you don't need to take in a knife to cut rellenos.  I was literally cutting through what seemed like raw chile.  The rellenos we have at our employee dining room tastes better than theirs.  And Leticia's is not cheap.  \n\nTheir award-winning tacos were delicious however, and that's what warranted them that extra star.  Their fried ice cream was also very good.  Their tres leches cake was not as moist as it should be -- weird.  That's what tres leches cake is about.  Moist and milky.  It tasted like boxed cake with milk and slivered almonds poured over it.  Other than that, the middle was somewhat dry.  \n\nWill probably never go again."
1,"I was working in the strip mall here and this place was recommended to me, although for the pizza and not the eggplant Parmesan that I ended up having. The lunch slices looked like they had been sitting out for awhile so I went with the sandwich.\nThe cook (owner?) was so not into answering questions (he reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld). He did say that he makes the sandwiches fresh but I'm skeptical of the fried eggplant, not very fresh tasting, also a little over cooked, almost burnt. Tomato sauce was tasty but not enough of it. \nI won't be going back."
2,"Olive Garden has been around for as far back as I can remember. I've been eating at this place my whole life, and while their food is nothing short of excellent, other elements of the restaurant leave a lot to be desired. \n\nFirst and foremost, the food. It's great. Olive Garden's Italian cuisine is far better than that of most other \""chain\"" restaurants, and their prices won't break the bank either. I don't think I have ever come to this restaurant and not thoroughly enjoyed my entree. There is something for everyone on their menu - soups, salads, pasta dishes, italian sodas, desserts, it's all here. \n\nHowever, this location's service leaves a lot to be desired. The wait times are often ridiculous, even for a party of two! The employees are always friendly, but sometimes lacking mentally. One time, when I was seated in the cafe area, the waitress took our order without even writing it down. Minutes later, she comes out with a salad when my girlfriend clearly ordered soup. She was nice and corrected the mistake promptly, but said she \""though [my girlfriend] said salad.\"" A, you should have written our order down. B, the words SOUND NOTHING ALIKE. Additionally, there have been times where they have been very slow in bringing out entrees/drinks/etc.\n\nOne thing I DO like about the restaurant, however, is that managers frequently come around and ask if everything is good. This way, if there IS a problem with your order, you have someone you can convey it to. They often give you the opportunity to perform surveys regarding your service, offering discounts on future visits for doing such. \n\nOlive Garden has great food and I will always eat here. However, don't come in here expecting the best of service.\n\nFood: A\nService: C+\nAtmosphere: B+"
1,"Okay, so finally tried the place....it was okay.  There was no one at the host stand when we walked in, waited a few minutes, then heard a man yelling at a waitress to go seat us. Turns out it was our waitress and she did not look too happy.\n\nLet's get to the nitty gritty- what was good:\nwhole catfish (minus the head even though I would've liked it with) moist inside and crunchy outside.\nbaked beans were AWESOME! even for someone like me to hates beans\nHalf chicken was decent, nice flavor but some parts were pretty dry\nTurnip greens were good\n\nThe not so good:\nOur waitress was very helpful but was so slow and at times we had to have the other wait staff find her for us\nMy man had the peach tea...it was a little on the tangy side ( uh its supposed to be peach, not lemon tea)\nMini cornbread, dry and a little hard\nLots of other customers complaining and wanting to talk to the manager due to the kitchen taking FOREVER to get the food out\n\nOverall, it was just okay- don't think we'll be back...location is closer to our house but think we'll drive all the way to GV and go to Lucille's instead."
4,This place is where I regularly go. The pedicure is awesome! I haven't found another nail salon in Vegas that does it better. I get like to get my fill done by Richard. He does great work!\nI also have my eyebrows done here. They always look perfect. The staff here is so nice and accommodating. Definitely try this place out!
3,"Really like this place! Mostly do delivery. Does take a bit of time sometimes for the food to get here. However, once it arrives, it's  quite tasty.\n\nThey have great dishes over all but I have to say their ramen dishes are great when you are under the weather!\n\nBBQ is always flavorful, tasty and filling. Mac and cheese is out of this world. Their food reminds me of when I lived in Hawaiian.\n\nOnly dish I would not recommend is the scallops. Had it two different times. Personally, I am just not a fan of deep fried scallops. Wish they would just toss then on the grill and season them instead. \n\nHave to say you can't go wrong with the Thai tea with boba! Also I suggest getting a Musubi."

0,"ive been going to zia records (the mill ave location) for 10 years now.  Never had a single problem, i love the friggin place.  I now live next to their chandler blvd location, and went in tonight to trade in about 150 movies.   This curly haired kid with glasses greets me and lets me know he has someone ahead of me with even more movies then i had, and that itd be about 2 hours before they could get to mine, it was seven pm and they dont close until 11 pm, PLENTY OF TIME,  but he really wanted me to wait until tomorrow, he kept insisting and recommending i wait until tomorrow, but i decided to leave the movies with them and get it done tonight anyway.  He left my movies outside of the area behind the desk (even though there was plenty of room behind the desk, including three empty long shelves)  in front of a rack of their movies, at the feet of where the customers walked, now i dont mean to be picky about that, but ive grown up around plenty of kids who would gladly take that oppurtunity to snatch a couple movies, that are obviously not the stores movies,  they could easily walk out with them without tripping the alarm.  He assured me theyd be fine there, so i walked out and said \""ill see you guys soon\""  then i got to thinking, those are going to be sitting there for two hours, just inviting people to snatch them, so i walked back in and showed him that theyd fit JUST FINE on the shelf behind their desk, and he finally fricken gave in....  THANK YOU, jesus christo\n\nSO, by now its obvious the little brat is lazy and doesnt want to work past 9 pm\n\nThey call me around 9 pm to tell me my quote is ready, and that i needed to be down there by 10 pm.... even though they are open until 11.  I get there at 9 30 and i had a couple extra movies i had forgot that i wanted to add on, but he didnt want to take in any more trade ins. after asking a couple times, he finally gives in. \n\n   Now the real trouble starts.  So the kid put aside 47 of my movies that they would only give me 5 cents for, which is understandable because they werent in the best condition (when i got home i found out that 10 of them were perfectly fine, i had watched the movie once or twice and then it sat in its case)  Anyway, the kid was going to give me 33 dolars for everything including the 5 cent videos, but i decided to just keep the 5 cent videos. So 47 movies for 5 cents each is almost $2.50, but if i wanted to keep them he was going to take the price down to $22.  i tried and tried to explain to him that it doesnt make sense to take away $11 if they are only worth $2. He just kept saying its our policy its our policy.  BS DUDE!!.  So now the red headed manager, i think her name was paula, steps in to try and help, and she proves my point that im supposed to get $31 for the movies, but her and the kid dont realize he was telling me id only be getting $22, they tell me that i misunderstood, and the kid starts acting like he was going to be giving me $31 the whole time.  So because i was angry, they are all acting like \""whats his problem\"" never realzing that it was him who had screwed up and gave me the wrong price.  it took me 15 minutes of arguing with these people to get the money they owed me, and still they all thought it was me who misunderstood.  I never got an \""im sorry sir, i was confused or i added it up wrong\"" they just sat there and looked at me as if i was the one who misunderstood, and they even told me that i was the one who misunderstood.\n\nWhat a bunch of idiots."
4,I'm a regular here. Love to order the fit mushroom omelette and steal a pancake or two from the hubby. The strawberry syrup is a favorite and I loveeee to eat my pancakes slowly while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
2,Great food. Bad service. Took a while for them to give us menus and food took longer than usual so be prepared to wait. Food is delicious. Can get really crowded/noisy at times.
3,"Good service. Otherwise it's just another Applebee's. If you've seen one, you've seen them all."
4,"I come here for lunch quite often. Good food, decent pricing, and nice staff. During the weekday you order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to you. On weekends they have full table service so expect to pay a little more. Most of the entrees are your typical tex-mex, but still excellent tasting. They do have a selection of the more wild entrees, and even fresh oysters. There are several kinds of salsa available; I think the chipotle salsa is my favorite. After several visits I have never had a bad experience."
2,"You definitely get a wide variety of options at the P-Stone.  One of those is probably not great service.  Good service, yes, but not great service.  So you probably want to get a drink if you can, as it would help alleviate this problem.  Also bring some friends along so you don't notice how slow they are.\n\nWhile you'll find a pretty appetizing-sounding menu, it's not so great in execution.  For instance, the burgers are fairly promising, but they were way overcooked.  Rather than getting well-done patties, had they been about medium, they would have been full of juicy goodness.\n\nThe pepper jack macaroni and cheese was unfortunate as well - just a blob of cheese sauce and overkill on the peppers.  Too bad, as it sounds good on paper (or laminate - whatever).\n\nAtmosphere is pretty cool, even inside with all the wood.  Definitely better than the old cramped interior of the Bayou Kitchen (which probably outdid them on food).  Unfortunately if the weather is spotty it can put a damper on things - the regular band plays inside instead of out, and the cornhole bags get wet and hard instead of being nice and soft like they should be.  Your hands are pretty nasty after playing too.\n\nStill, it is a decent outdoor area - just would be nice if there was a way to have some sort of shelter in inclement weather!"
2,"I've been here twice. First for the pumpkin patch and then just yesterday for the moonlight mud run. The pumpkin patch was well organized and they had everything set up. \n\nThe mud run was a blast because it was my first one ever. With that being said there were a couple things that stood out to me. The generator ran out of gas for the showers at the end so over 100 people lined up and just starred at one another. They had to run to the gas station to get more. -_- poor planning. Then, there was some crazy drunk lady that worked at the ranch running around belligerent. I thought it was funny but then again I wasn't the person she was hanging and hugging on in line. \n\nWith that said I will go back here because I want to check out the moonlit ride. Sounds fun! Hopefully the guide isn't drunk ;)"
2,"Good atmosphere to workout. Lots of yoga classes. The gym is seems to be almost always close to empty. Not as \""hip\"" as the other David Barton gyms around the country"
2,"My friends and I were pretty excited to come here, thinking it might be our new go-to spot for brunch, but all 4 of us were underwhelmed. First off, I had a rough time parking- my friends walked, but i had to park in what I'm pretty sure was an illegal spot to avoid being 10 minutes late. Luckily, no ticket. We also had a reservation, but ended up waiting about 15 minutes past our reserved time for a table. After that, the service was good, nothing memorable, though.\n\nI had the Chilaquiles:\nCorn tortilla chips topped with braised chicken, \nguajillo chili sauce, queso fresco, avocado, \njalape\u00f1os, cilantro, radish,\nand two eggs over easy.\n\nIt was okay, but I opted not to take home the leftovers... it didn't blow me away. Others at my table had the burrito, breakfast sammy, and farmer's hash. All said their food was okay, but nothing we hadn't had before. We probably should have sprung for the donuts, but by the time our meal was over, we were feeling a little disheartened and just felt like leaving. Seriously, we had really high hopes. It looks like the brunch club has gotten better reviews, so maybe we caught it a little too early, before they had time to work out the kinks and tweak the recipes.... I hope so. Maybe we'll try it again some time."
4,I give this place 5stars cause they have some cool and hard to find books. I thought my college books were expensive when I was paying 400bucks per book....this place made me feel like I was paying lunch money for my medical books...crap!
1,Overpriced crap.
2,"Americanized. Everything is very sweet. Ordered the Pad See-Ew, Tom Yum soup, and the Beef salad. Decent price, although I have to compliment their interior. Very modern and clean."
3,"Loved Squid Ink!  They have such unique and interesting specialty rolls that I haven't seen anywhere else.  But they aren't so unique that they taste crazy like some specialty rolls I've had elsewhere.  We had the Dirty Rockstar Roll, which was very spicy but delicious too, Flying Phoenix (had a tasty but almost too overpowering pepper sauce), and my go-to at any sushi spot, Spicy Tuna.  There are at least 6 different house rolls that I MUST go back to try!  My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and had a great time with our sushi chef.  A ton of people ordered the \""Cougar\"" Roll which is wrapped in think cucumber...the chef made at least 7 of them while we were sitting there.  I will be going back for sure!  The only downside I experience was that our waitress didn't come by very often at all and we had to wait quite some time to get drink refills and to even get our bill.\n\nP.S.  I almost forgot!  The kitchen is open and right behind the sushi bar.  I don't know what the issue is but they were burning all sorts of stuff on the grill and there were several occasions where I was choking on the smoke.  It didn't look like the hood was above the right spot and so the smoke was filling up the area where we happened to be sitting.  You could even see on the ceiling that it was yellowed.  Will this stop me from coming again?...No, but it definitely might keep me from sitting in the dining area around the sushi bar."
1,"Went here with a group of friends and was disappointed. The atmosphere was formal but there were a couple major blunders.\n\n1) At $51 for a filet, you expect something really good. Not something with charred edges with nothing really spectacular\n2) One of my group is allergic to eggs and the waiter confirmed his order would be fine but then left the sauce. Someone else at the table noticed that it might have eggs and checked and the waiter confirmed it did and took it away without apologizing"
0,DON'T EAT HERE ! This place was so dark! I couldn't read the menu! I asked both the waiter and the manager if we could turn up the lights and they just said no. They brought me a flashlight to read the menu!  Stupid and just plain silliness. The guy and his girlfriend had to get out their phones to read the menu.  \nWe walked out.\n\n**NOTICE** the trending details for this place has gone down dramatically over the past 4 months.  What does that say!!  Service sucks.\n\n** NOTICE** One of the reviews mentions that there was a COCKROACH just not once but TWICE in someone's salad. Health department needs to come out to this place.
4,I came here for lunch and was able to try their Pad Thai. It comes with Shrimp and Chicken as well as your choice of soup or salad. We got it with Medium Spice and it was not too spicy. The lemonade was good also but no free refills. I would suggest this if your in Arcadia and looking for great priced Thai Food.
4,"Tim has been watching my dog since he was about 2 months old. Recently, my dog got a little sick and I had no idea what to do or what was wrong. Tim totally walked me through the process and helped guide me through what to expect when your dog isn't feeling well. He even offered to look through all the labels on my dog's food and treats to look for any ingredients that could cause allergies. He called me with updates on my dog while I was at work, since he knew how nervous I was. This is my first dog so knowing that I have Tim and APC to guide me and communicate with me, is a huge relief. The amazing part of this story is that I really didn't feel like a burden to Tim. I know how much he cares about my dog and that he would show any of his clients this much compassion.\n\nI really can't say enough positive things about the company. It's hard to trust someone with your pets, but I really do trust Tim and Absolute Pet Care!"
4,"Holy crap.....Top 3 best meals of my life for sure.  So I flew to vegas just for the evening to see my parents who were visiting and staying at the Bellagio....which was amazing in itself.  So we didn't have any set in stone dinner plans, but we were looking forward to a great meal.  I had heard prime was good, but my dad was actually the one who suggested it.  So we made reservation for 8:45 cuase my parents were going to see Criss Angel (which they said was so atrocious...) so they left early, and we were all starving so we went down to see if we could get in early, and to our surprise they sat us around 8:30 since they were super busy...It was 15 minutes- but still they did everything they could to help us out.  So we sat and were promptly greeted, and I mean service was wonderful and super friendly.  Our server even told us that they were understaffed that night (wow, they work well together) \n\nSo let me tell you what I was super impressed with (i'm pretty easy to please) but our server came over to open our wine...we ordered the Bethel Heights Pinot Noir, which isn't a baller wine, but a really amazing Pinot.  Anyways- so he came over to present it and as he was about to open it the table next to us very rudely kept telling him to come over while he was in the midst of opening the wine.....so I told him it would be fine if he found out what they wanted....since they were making a big to-do about it....it was actually quite absurd and rude.....and he goes \""No way, I am opening your wine, and you come first....\"" now this other table had multiple bottles of very expensive wine/champagne, and were a party of over 10.....the reason I was impressed was becuase the server didn't think about the money he was making with the other table, he made sure to take care of us and give us great service.  I was really happy.\n\nNow the food:  WOW.  I ordered the onion soup to start....I don't think once in my life have I ever been able to finish a full onion soup.....i almost licked the bowl, it was amazing.  My mom and I decided to split the 28 ounce ribeye (very very ambitious)  We obviously didnt' even come close.  But it was cooked to absolute medium rare perfection....the truffle mashed potatoes were super super super smooth- and absolutely melted in your mouth.  We also go the broccolli....okay i'm started to get hungry just talking about this food.  Anyways service was out of this world, food was incredible and the atmosphere warm and chairs were super comfy!!  I can't wait to go back :)"
2,"First off the food is pretty good. It's not amazing but good for the money spent. My wife loves the biscuits and their scrambles will fill you up.\n\nThe one downfall to TJ's is the owner, at least I believe he is the owner. From the four or five times I have been here I have overheard him drop the f bomb, talk down to his employees, degrade women and talk badly of them, and be very harsh with the customers and waitresses. It is to the point that my wife doesn't like going there and would rather me pick up the food and bring it home. \n\nJust beware if you go here you will find good food but a nasty owner at the front."
3,"A great, home-town ice cream spot. (although townies will give you a hard time if you call it ice cream). No doubt you are getting a fun experience when you come here. They have everything you would come to expect from standard dips of custard in cones or bowls, to slushy-type drinks and their version of the DQ blizzard. \n\nI give it 4 stars and not 5 because it is not a great value. You will easily spend $5 for a couple scoop/dips of custard and it is hard to shell out that kind of cash when there is 50 cent soft-serve down the street. Also, it never fails to frustrate me that their will only take credit cards if your total order is over $10. So be prepared with cash unless you are buying for you group/family!"
1,"Tough call here, but I'm giving this place 2 stars because Vegas is supposed to be fun.  This place wasn't.  Long lines for food, one (1!!!) valet guy, no inexpensive food options (18 dollar sandwiches), and no blackjack tables for less than $50.00.  I get it if Aria is going for the Four Seasons crowd, maybe trying to out-wynn The Wynn, but when the casino flaunts every table has a minimum of 50 dollars (meanwhile some are empty), their own ARIA-only, not M-Life Only, but ARIA-only rules on touching cards for certain games, well then they aren't trying to be fun.  No free drinks in the SPORTS BOOK....WTF?!?!  They are trying to be obnoxious.  Maybe I should have figured it out when the two largest signs as you drive that street are for LV and Gucci.  Bellagio is fun, MGM a blast, even 'slumming it' at the Monte Carlo seems like more fun.  This isn't.  I think the new-ness is what pulls people in.  \n\nI was there during super bowl weekend (Seahawks/Broncos).  Decorated very well.  Rooms are great.  Very comfortable.  EXCELLENT BED, fantastic shower.  Great decorations, waterfall walls, clean carpets, ipad-like room controls...but that isn't enough.  That isn't NEARLY enough.  \n\nIts vegas and you have sooo many more options.  If you are over 60 and money isn't EVER an issue, then I would recommend it."
1,"I stopped by Zada for the first time this week for a mid morning breakfast.  The service was fine, and the menu selection was diverse with some very interesting vegan and vegetarian options.  When I ordered my breakfast combo, the menu indicated I could pick one protein and one carb - and the carb I requested was the cup of fruit.  To my surprise, the waitress told me that there was an upcharge for this - really? an upcharge for a few pieces of melon, when my other options were potatoes, gritz, and a variety of other pretty unhealthy choices!  \n\nThe food itself was just decent...my scrambled eggs weren't very warm and weren't overly exciting - the turkey bacon had a unique taste and was pretty good, but the biscuit I had seemed rather old, as it was really dried out.  \n\nOverall Zada had a nice feel to it, a very unique place with unique menu selections, but I left rather disappointed."
0,"So rude! I called the store to ask a question. The clerk put me on hold for 13 minutes! I called back and got a messaging service saying this store was closed. All the clerk had to do was tell me they were closing, and I would've patiently waited to call back tomorrow!"
4,Best Thai food ever! I eat here when ever I want Thai.
4,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.\n\nAbout a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!\n\nEven the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.\n\nAlso, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!\n\nGo here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.\n\nAlmost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  \n\nJust go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
0,"I am dating a girl just up the road and we have walked in an ordered pizza to be delivered in the past the pizza is amazing and being a couple beers in I am really not sure how fast it was delivered. But I called again tonight to order in for one of those chill nights and it took 1:42 minutes to get our cold pizza. The poor delivery guy took my hurtful blows, instead of  the stoner on the phone who repeated back our information and wrote it down wrong. If you call and get the burnout just call the next company. \n\n\""We live in America where pizza is from.\"" Ricky Bobby"
4,Excellent Navajo food!
0,Don't bring kids here...this a family restaurant that doesn't want kids.  Staff is disrespectful to kids and families with small kids.  Decent product poor staff and management.  In fact unless you are perfect like the staff don't go here.  Did I mention that being insulted by staff members is encouraged here?
3,Fantastic prices - my fleece was \u00a315 - and a good selection of gear given the size of the store.
2,"The restaurant is beautiful and the service is excellent but for me when you spend this much money for steak you really wanted to be wowed, and my expectations fell short.  I even ordered their filet with bone-in which is what everyone tells you to get here. The meat quality was great, it just missed some seasoning or something to take it to the next level.\n\nActually, I enjoyed the side dishes and desert better than the steak. \n\nThis place was just ok, not great."
2,"I give Palatte 3.5 stars.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is lovely. The patio is beautiful and the servers are really friendly. \n\nI've been here a couple of times on the weekend, and I must say, avoid it at all costs. It is so extremely over-crowded it kind of ruins the experience. And if you come on a weekend, bring some friends to help with the process. One of you stands in line and orders, and the others scout the place out for a table. Oh, and bring company that you will enjoy for a long period of time, because on a weekend your food will take upwards of 40 minutes to arrive. I came here for my birthday brunch last year with the boy, having no idea that the place would be so crowded (it was a Sunday). Being hungover and all, I found myself a little grumpy with all of the chaos. But what do you expect at a downtown joint on the weekend? \n\nThe food is great. It's a wee bit pricey so it's probably more of a splurge (at least for breakfast). I usually get The Potato - spinach, cheese, potatoes, bacon, and onion. Yum. I suggest getting the eggs well done because sometimes they can be a little runny. Eck. The boy consistently orders the french toast (they change it every few months) and it is fabulous. Super sweet though, so I would recommend it only if you've got a sweet tooth goin' on. The potatoes are pretty good, too. Sometimes though they aren't cooked completely, and I'm not too fond of the creme fraiche sauce on the side- too sour. \n\nAnyway, if you've got a free weekday morning and some good friends to go, I highly recommend it. Sit outside on the patio and have mimosas...yum!"
4,"Something I'd never thought I'd say about this pizza vs. Chicago pizza - it's better.  WAY better.\n\nI had just gotten back from a trip to Chicago, and while I was there, I went on a pizza tour, thus getting to sample many different types of pizza.  And yes, this little place in Madison, WI was BETTER.  Than ALL of them.\n\nMaybe it had to do with the \""unusual\"" toppings, the huge selection, the friendly service... but whatever it was, it almost made me wish I lived in Madison so I could eat here more often.  Almost.  I live in San Diego, and Madison is just too damn cold for this SoCal native.\n\nBut anyway, the pizza.  After agonizing for several minutes about which slices to try, my friend and I split the mac & cheese pizza (her recommendation, as she lives in Madison and has been here several times) and something delicious with BBQ sauce, pulled pork, corn, and cheddar.  Both were amazing.  I couldn't decide which I liked better because they were so different.\n\nI will definitely come back here when I visit Madison again... but not in April.  TOO COLD!!!  Brrr."
1,Garlic fries made our drinks taste bad. Fish and chips are good. Need to train waitress with red hair to pay attention to party of six instead of ignoring us for table of two right next to us.  We are waving check around trying to pay and we are still getting ignored.
0,Thought id give this place another try. Ordered a medium French vanilla iced latte and powdered jelly donut. What did I get? ...a regular iced coffee and sugar jelly donut. Lol oh man. Maybe I should just try ordering the opposite and I'll actually get what I want.
0,While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt.  I was led astray!  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door.  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.
0,"the only reason i gave them one star is because negative stars were not an option. we walked into a very empty restaurant on a sunday @ lunch time. we were finally greeted by a frumpy hostess after she finished her conversation with a co worker. we opted to sit at the bar, which was so much worse on a customer service level. this woman was down right scary looking and just plane nasty attitude. she informed me there were only 2 kinds of beer to chose from. SERIOUSLY ONLY TWO KINDS OF BEER IN A BEER HOUSE? WTH???  then i asked the bartender about the food, an she wanted to make it an arguement. i can see why her bar was totally empty and so was the restaurant. this place is a very poor excuse of a german restaurant,, and a really bad impression of the guest service! save your money and your eyes!"
2,"D\u00e9ception! Nous avions tellement d'attentes envers le haut lieu de la gastronomie... Certains plats \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t ordinaires, d'autres bon mais rien a avoir envie d'y retourner... Service plut\u00f4t ordinaire, je convient que le jeune homme \u00e0 fait de son mieux mais une mauvaise connaissance du menu n'a pas expliquer celui ci... Et il avait un fran\u00e7ais approximatif bravo pour l'effort mais va ne va pas si tout. Au prix de l'exp\u00e9rience celle -ci se doit d'\u00eatre parfaite, ce qui ne ne fut pas le cas. On y retourne.... Non"
3,"I am updating this review because of the way that the management staff handled our previous experience. We were treated very well by management here they were able to please us and I was finally able to try the Dry Aged Rib Eye that I wanted to try on my first visit and I have to say it was delicious, I also have to say the service this time around was impeccable. Good recovery Flemmings , thanks to your manager you have earned at least this customer back. Thank you"
1,"We went to Zen today for lunch. It is an interesting concept because it menu provides an option of Asian inspired dishes as well as Spanish inspired dishes. The table went for Asian, except for one friend, who went with a Spanish inspired salad.\n\nWe had a group of 7 and needed to be seated quickly because we have exactly 1 hour for lunch. I called ahead to make a reservation which was a really easy process and our table was ready for us when we arrived.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive. My water glass was always full which was a plus!\n\nI enjoyed my lunch (Kung Pow Chicken) but it was not the best I've ever had. It said on the menu it was supposed to be spicy, but I had to ask for a side of chili oil and siracha to make it spicy to my taste (it was rather mild). It was a large portion, so I will have leftovers for dinner! The amount of veggies was great. I am only giving two stars because while the service was good and the food was fine, I have had much better Chinese food and I prefer other Asian places in Charlotte (SoHo Bistro, KO Sushi). And minus one start because no sushi menu for lunch!\n\nSolid-ish place, good service, ok food. I was content with my meal. I would go back, maybe at dinner so I could try the sushi. I am still confused by the Asian/Spanish theme."
1,"I am a person who believes in keeping things positive and not dwelling too much in the negative but I have to be honest here. Not a good experience and I gave it several tries. I am putting this review up because I believe that it could help make room for improvement where needed. I did not have the relaxed, lovely experiences one might expect and want from a nail salon. I felt rushed, overlooked, taken advantage of during the times I was there. I wanted to love it out of convenience for me but I have since found another place and it's exactly what I've been looking for. Happi Nails needs a little more sincere customer service ~ the kind that makes each client feel like they are equally important and that it's not all about money. Maybe get some additional employees to help with this? I think this place has potential but it definitely needs some improvement."
0,"I guess Church's Chicken is a brand name so you've either made up your mind about that brand, or have yet to try that brand, but for the most part you're going there for the brand name and not a unique experience. On the other hand though, this is an odd one. This used to be Philly Cheese Steak restaurant and it was one of those walk up or drive thru only type of deals that had no dining room. That store went down probably because of it's service. I remember that restaurant had a best Philly Cheese Steak of Las Vegas rating from the Las Vegas Review Journal for like 2 years in a row back in like 2001, 2002 or something like that. Then I remember ordering a a sandwich and waiting 45 freakin' minutes for a freakin turkey cheese steak sandwich and some fries. 45 freakin' minutes in somewhat cold weather because it was just turning into fall and I left the house without a jacket not thinking that it would be so cold, or that I would have to wait 45 freakin' minutes for one sandwich when I was the ONLY ONE standing in front of that place. I actually remember that when I was waiting for my order, a car that was ordering something through the drive thru cursed out one of the employees because he was waiting and it was his lunch break and he was pissed. Needless to say, that place got shut down a few months after. The had a decent sandwich but not worth 45 minutes of waiting... OUTSIDE!    IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! The conditions are never good outside here. It's either too hot, too cold, or windy as hell....It stayed shut down for about 3 years. \n \n   I believe it was somewhere around this time last year when Church's Chicken took over. I don't remember ever going to a Church's Chicken so I figured I'd give it a try. Initially I wanted to dine in but I soon realized that they didn't have a dining room. Either way, I wanted to try it and I walked up to the window. This was around 6-7pm, right in the middle of the night time rush and the window is facing one of the busiest streets in Vegas, Nellis Blvd....PLUS it was windy outside so I basically had to yell my order at the guy three times before he was able to hear what I said and he had to repeat it to me just a many times till he got the #whatever with the beans and extra corn, or whatever I ordered right. \n\n   As bad as that was, there was already two people that ordered before me. I guess the first person ordered a large order and had to wait a bit for her order. I think she ordered a bucket of something or an office trash can or whatever they put 20 pieces of chicken in. Anyway, both the person after her and eventually my orders came before hers and every time the window would open, that lady would walk up to the window and say \""that's not my order\"". Well she was right but they never called her order for pick up in the first place. She did that again with my order and asked where the chicken was ( I ordered some chicken finger meal that all fit in one bag) and once again the guy had to say that it wasn't her order. Again. \n\n   I already was not liking this place, but I got my order and took it home. I ordered a meal that had the chicken strips, fries, a biscuit and a piece of corn..... The corn was good.... The chicken strips were really dry and all I remember was that NEEDED to eat it with the BBQ sauce and as soon as I ran out I stopped eating the chicken. The fries were garbage. They were this mix of being soggy and hard at the same time. It's as if they fried them and let them sit in the fryer but turned the heat off and just let them sit there. I barely even ate those fries. The biscuit was good though. They have those biscuits with the honey-butter baked into them. I wish I had some extra honey to spread on it instead of butter. The corn was...well it was corn. If they screwed that up then I would have left my house with that corn in my hand, go back to the store and break that window with it but luckily for them it was good. After all, all they had to do was throw it in some boiling water for a while. \n\n   Overall, I just did not like the place. I know that I didn't get the signature chicken wings that you're supposed to go there for but I still got something they were offering on their menu so either do it good or don't do it at all. There's a KFC, Wing Stop, and a Popeye's all within a block away from this place and any one of those are a better option for your fried chicken needs."
3,"Definitely a Phoenix institution.  I think everyone who sets foot in this place knows that most of the evening's enjoyment will come from the classic feel of the place (well covered in other reviews), which includes the food.  \n\nIt has standard steakhouse menu options.  Nothing is super healthy, nothing is disgustingly greasy, and portion sizes are pretty average (none of this tiny food silliness, but not over large).  Preparation is great (but not fancy or impeccable).  The drinks are well made, and the service is simple but effective to match the rest of the place.  If that sounds good to you, you'll have a wonderful evening here!"
3,"This was by far the best meal I had in Scottsdale. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Our table had salads, the scallop appetizer, trout, shrimp and the swordfish special. And of course, the green chile mac & cheese and the asparagus sides. There was not a complaint among us -- and we're a picky group. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavors were amazing together. We had notning bad to say about this restaurant! \n\nThe server recommended terrific wines and was knowledgeable and attentive. \n\nI will absolutely go back to this restaurant when I'm in town again. It was a great experience."
1,"It was ok. Expected the gyro to have more flavor and be WARMER. Really average food, and kind of spendy for the average quality."
2,"I enjoyed staying here for the second time in 2 years. I was here for a baseball tournament and I think, for the price, it fulfills what I would expect to get. The rooms are clean and well maintained and the breakfast buffet is a great addition. The service was friendly as well when I checked in or had any questions. I will continue to stay here."
1,"I was just in Las Vegas this week. I enjoy the Rio and had Total Reward points,so I decided to go to their Carnival World Buffet. The system was very nice in terms of paying via their kiosk.  \nI had a taste for Chinese food.  The white rice was almost gone and what was left was ALL DRIED OUT!  The seafood was not impressive. The selection of food items was not exciting.  \nI did not care for this buffet as I have been to better ones.  \nThe waiter was lousy as he did not check to see if I wanted a refill on my beverage, so no tip for him!\nThere was absolutely nothing that I wanted seconds on.  \nIn Las Vegas, you should be able to find a better buffet."
2,"Kung Fu Plaza Restaurant is one of the first restaurants you see as you enter Las Vegas Chinatown from the strip. I can't stand the name of the restaurant, but the food is not too shabby. A few years ago, I thought this place was the bomb, but I think because of the combination of food we ordered, I left feeling underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so spectacular either. This restaurant offers both Thai and Chinese cuisine.\n\nGotta have Tom Yum. We ordered the seafood. For 13 bucks, they didn't give us much soup, and the seafood was sparse, but it tasted alright. \n\nThe Pad Thai was decent. Kind of hard to mess up pad thai.\n\nMy sister ordered the Cashew Chicken. This was just an average dish. \n\nThe Pan-fried Catfish was everyone's favorite. The fish wasn't perfectly fried by a long shot, but the sauce was very good. I'm not sure why it says that the sauce is \""curry like\"" on the menu, but it was a bit spicy, and the basil added fragrance. I love spicy! \n\nOk, let me tell you about this dish that hubby ordered. He has a history of ordering bad dishes. This was the Pa Nang Curry with Beef. It was like scooping a spoonful of peanut butter into my mouth. My mom said it was \""so weird\"" in Vietnamese. It was.\n\nLots of photos and full review on my blog."

0,"Not the business.. If your stomach is growling and your hungry for some mariscos that are gonna hit the spot macizo..... Don't go there. Ceviche was decent at best, my shrimp cocktail tasted like it needed life. My girl got some botana that had lobster grilled tilapia shrimp wrapped in bacon shrimped fried in batter and said that all of it was bland.. I don't usually deprive my waiters/waitress of their tips but with this one I had no choice, I left a 3 dollar tip on a 50 something dollar tab. Horrible service and not quite hits the spot food. This is actually the first review I've ever written before this I didn't even have an account with yelp to write reviews I mean I've wanted to write reviews on places even when they were bad, but never did.. This place was so disappointing that I took the time out of my day to download yelp, create an account, confirm the account on my email just to come back to the app to write this long review.. And the only reason I did is because I don't want any other person that knows what a good marisco tastes like to walk in and settle with this place. Hope this was helpful..."
1,"meh. came here for a quick work lunch which turned into a bit longer than we really liked work lunch. no one was manning the hostess station so we had to find someone and ask if we could seat ourselves. after sitting for about 10 min someone finally came around and brought us menus and took our drink order. i noticed that there were only two people working the whole place (bartender and waitress) and that communication with each other was not exactly their forte. \n\nyes, i ordered a burger (guacamole, no bun, no cheese) at the mexican place. dont shoot me for it. i just didnt feel like a food coma this afternoon would make me exceptionally productive. it was just ok. wasn't a huge fan of the fries.\n\noverall a lackluster lunch that didnt impress. i still dont really understand why it was recommended by someone from work. never trusting them again."
0,"Run. If you really want to try it do what we did, tour it first. Dirty and cheap looking. I remember this buffet from a few years ago. It has not changed..."
4,"Had an invitation to the pre-sale so we decided to check it out.  As expected, crazy packed!  Really like the fact that they brought some employees from other Nordstrom Racks so they were very efficient and was able to deal with the hectic environment.  \n\nI purchased some golf shirts and my wife purchased some workout clothes and heels.  I will definitely return weekly to see how well they stock their items.  \n\nTip: you can ask pretty much any employee with a neon green shirt to check you out remotely.  No need to wait in line at the registers located up front."
2,"**Breakfast Review**\n\nThe Cafe at THEhotel is the best breakfast establishment in the Mandalay Bay complex. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a quality breakfast with large portions...but beware, as you might expect at a swanky hotel with a pretentious name, you will be shelling out big bucks for the privilege.\n\nFood:\nThe food is straight up good and the star of both our visits. The build-your-own three-ingredient Omelet was huge and the ingredients fresh and plentiful. I went with the bacon, spinach, aged cheddar omelet both days and was very happy I did. The hash browns were excellent and not at all greasy and the bread was also very good.\n\nPrice:\nThe entrees are a little over what you would expect, but not much. It's the drinks that will kill you. For the price of one ~5oz. glass of Orange Juice, you would expect someone to grind the orange right in front of you...or something like that. No refills either. You're getting cha-chinged each time you want another thimble of OJ. Coffee and tea are also priced well above even what Starbucks charges.\n\nService:\nMediocre at best. We had a difficult time flagging down anyone if our drinks went dry or if we had a problem. Additionally, REVIEW YOUR BILL. We were charged for two coffees we never ordered. The server laughed off her mistake, but I didn't find it so funny at their prices.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe restaurant's decor is very modern, with extremely high ceilings and open walls to the public walkway. You sort of feel on display, but you also feel like the people walking by are longing for the giant omelet in front of you. :)\n\nSo, if you are looking for a great breakfast at Mandalay Bay, but aren't afraid of paying high prices or being let down by service, The Cafe is THErestaurant at THEhotel to visit."
3,Love this place!  I've been climbing at this gym for over a decade now.
1,Sandi the waitress is terrible. food was ok.
4,"Awesome customer service and great tasting treats! My pregnant fianc\u00e9 was having major cravings for this place. It was right at 8pm when we called to see when they close. She said that they close at 8pm. We live right across the street so she told us that she would wait to close until we got there. Needless to say, I have a satisfied pregnant woman next to me, which makes me a satisfied customer! They went above and beyond for us. Try the maple bacon cronuts!"
1,"Used to be better. Bad service now, resulting in cold food and no refills. Also, the bus boy parked a very dirty and reeking cart right next to us while he cleaned the adjacent table. After telling all this to the staff while paying (10-minute wait in line just to pay), they said they were sorry - that's it. I'll probably go somewhere else from now on."
3,Very diverse Asian menu!  If you have a hang over go for the Fo!
3,"Park on Fremont was great. We'd just put down a huge breakfast and wanted to sit in the sun like beached sea lions. The Park provided just the atmosphere for that and then some. The staff is lovely and eager to please. The only downside is they didn't have the beer my partner ordered. Otherwise, perfect place to enjoy the sights of Fremont."
0,"If you're only going to take one thing away from this review, it's don't go to Hakkasan and try the other clubs the strip has to offer like Marquee, XS, or Lights!\n\nMy friends and I have had a multitude of terrible experiences at Hakkasan. I know why do I keep coming back right? Because they have the most popular DJs I'll give them that, but also because I unfortunately, trust too wholeheartedly. \n\nI contacted the promoter, Peter Nguyen (avoid this promoter like the plague), and he was willing to help my friends and I get in for free with table service. However, we showed up on Friday night and he said that we would be found. The catch was he didn't even know what we looked like. We ended up being packed in like sardines on the dance floor, while guys were shoving and punching us! It also took us DAYS to get on and the same amount to get off. \nThen on Saturday night we went back because he apologized and promised unlimited table service. When we texted him that we were here, he said made up some bullshit excuse that he couldn't come get us for another 2 hours, so we waited. When the clock struck 12:30 am, we texted him and he failed to reply. We were left feeling stupid yet again.\n\nI gave both Ling-Ling (bottom hip-hop floor) and Hakkasan a chance, and needless to say, I'll most likely not be coming back to this terrible and overly crowded club. Also girls, the whole club is built with angled walkways and this really gets to your toes in those heels and cuts off all circulation to those poor little piggies. Avoid having to walk up and down these treacherous walkways by avoiding Hakkasan!"
3,"***This review is for the breakfast bar.***\n\nI've been thinking about going in for awhile now and I am so glad that I did! This place is adorable. It looks like a library meets a hotel lobby. It definitely could be a wonderful place to work from home or for a business meeting. \n\nAs for the food, I tried the egg sandwich and the salted carmel sticky bun. OMG the salted carmel sticky bun was out of this world and it was especially nice because it wasn't too heavy like a normal cinnamon bun. It was thinner and lighter. The egg sandwich was solid and enjoyable.\n\nThe only downside (which wasn't big) is that the coffee is just so-so and they only have one option to choose from, but that could change since they are new.\n\nOverall a great experience and I will definitely be returning!"
0,Ok I have given this place 3 try's. And it doesn't matter if you eat in or curbside. It's hit or miss. Guess it just depends on who plates your order. I ordered rib tips  curbside. What I got were doggie treats. So tough they can't be called rib tips. I had complained before because I got a bunch of bones and  manager gave me a 10$ gift card. My meal was more than that. Only went back because on BBQ restaurant around but no more I'm done. And I'm going in today for a refund !
1,"I recently visited Arizona and really wanted to go to a brazillian steakhouse. Having gone to Fogo when it first opened, I really wanted to go again.\n\nFirst, when we got there. We sat immediately. We also had meats en route to us not 30 seconds later. This was very nice.\n\nSadly, our drink orders were forgot about. Along with that, all the meats were very bland and were nothing special. 50 dollars a plate was about 35 dollars too much. \n\nI have even been to the Fogo De Chao in Las Vegas. That restaurant was far superior to this one. I feel like they just don't care as much at this location."
4,"Raku turned out to be one of those places that got me saying \""holy hellfire s, Yelp, thanks for letting me know!\""\n\nAs a fan of our local Yu Me Ya Sake House, Raku was already on the radar.  Our Sat night dinner confirmed the best of my expectations.\n\nTwo items in the surprisingly f'n good category were:\n- The fried and cold tofu.  Who could imagine, especially with cold tofu, that something could be so flavorful?  (Who could imagine that I'd even eat tofu when the meat menu was so lengthy?)\n- The Kobe beef tendon.  Our server warned that it's \""slimy.\""  It's not what I'd anticipated, after having tendon in pho and tweaking various tendons in my body.  Consistency of butter, and an incredibly rich bordering-on-foie-gras flavor... wow!\n\nOur server was very gracious and helpful with recommendations.  \n\nEven though it's in a strip mall, the interior is beautiful.\n\nThere will be another trip from the Strip there on my next Vegas excursion."
1,"Bought the half-price groupon for this place.  Except their prices are nearly double a normal store price.  Not really a deal, and poor selection."
3,"i really enjoyed myself there..  the pool area is the best, the restaurant and the staff are both wonderful..  it is a friendly, hip and comfy place.. a great place for a \"" daycation\""!.. i would have given 5 stars but there was one thing that annoyed me...  the room was too dark.... i had to keep all the lights on in the daytime to see.... otherwise, i think it is a great place to stay!"
4,"The cookies rock.  That's all I got to say.  When browsing Glendale, stop in and buy one.  \n\n\nAvoid Bitzee Mama's mexican restaurant a few doors north of there."
3,"First off, I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I tried this place. I tried this place by accident since my regular hole wasn't ready for lunch and it was early still. I had the green burrito and bought 3 more for my guys at work as a thanks. We all loved them. One of the first things I always try is a green burrito, so I have had a lot of different ones. This place ranks with the best of them. We ended up eating here three days this week. I went with my other favorite Pastor and it was awesome as well. Neither burrito wasn't spicy, but I can handle really hot food, so I'm not the best guy to ask is it spicy or not. One of my guys , who I joke with telling him he had to turn in his Mexican card because he sweats just looking at black pepper, really enjoyed it because he could eat it all, although he still had a sheen of sweat on his brow. The staff was really friendly as well. Their prices are great for the portions you get."
1,"If you are a vegetarian and are looking for a great vegetarian sub, do yourself a favor and skip Firehouse - it's not worth your time!\n\n(However, I have to be honest, I gave them two stars because we went on recommendation of my boss who LOVES IT and my boyfriend thought his sub was pretty OK. \""pretty OK\"" doesn't seem that promising to me though. ha!)"
0,"I called Chanel at Wynn 10/26/11 in the afternoon and asked if I could exchange an item I bought at chanel.com.  The sales rep said it would be fine as long as I have a receipt.  Awesome.  \nSo, I left right away and drove from the north side of town, which is quite a distance, to exchange the product.  When I gave the brunette in charge of make-up my powder and receipt, she went to the back to speak with the manager and came back and told me she could not exchange my product and I would have to ship it back.  I got frustrated, of course, because I was just told it would be fine and I just drove a long distance, WHICH I explained to her, and this is what she said, \""I apologize but it is what it is...\"" .  She didn't even care and did not even try to pull some strings for me, considering the situation.  I left very angry.  \nSince I was in the area I called Chanel at Belagio and asked if they would do it.  Guess what?  They did it.\nShows the character of the girl in charge of make-up at Chanel at Wynn.  She knew I was misinformed and I I took a long drive to get there and she didn't even care.  That is just messed up."
2,All im there for is  cold.drinks and pretty girls.native has both :-) servers are hot.bartender i think her name Michelle.very attractive. Bar food is ok.im.more comfortable around  my chicano people but this.place is cool when.im.on.this.side of.town
4,"Honey Salt had an atmosphere that is comfy, yet modern and classy at the same time. The menu  consists of comfort food with a contemporary twist. I had the Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken, and it was AMAZING! Overall, Honey Salt gets a 5 star for their food and impeccable service."
2,"Not the nicest bar in Madison by a long shot, but the KK provides solid entertainment. \n\nThe good: Drinks are cheap, bathrooms and new layout are much nicer than in years past, a make shift \""dance floor\"" usually makes its way near the back. The bar food is decent overall.\n\nThe questionable: If you are a jersey chaser of any sort, there are always plenty of athletes here....from benchwarmers to quarterbacks.\n\nThe bad: The floors are disgustingly sticky. The crowd can range from douchey and jerky to skanky and wasted. Lines can be stupid long and the occasional bouncer showcases an enormous power trip.\n\nI've had plenty of evenings at the KK...some much better than others. Memories..."
3,"Ate here on 5/18/13 with 5 others for a birthday. Gotta say, food was really good. My favorite was the flank steak. So juicy and cooked perfectly. Mushrooms were also tasty. Chicken was just ok. To be honest, when you come to places like these, skip the chicken and only order steak. Pay for what you get. You can order chicken anytime, anywhere. That's just me. The Sangria was probably the best I have tasted.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nOverall: B+"
4,"I love the gelati!!!  What is a gelati?  Flavored frozen custard, italian ice, and more frozen custard.  Yes, it is FABULOUS!  I got the vanilla custard with blue raspberry.  They have tons of combs and flavors.  Or you are choice:\n\n1.  Milkshakes\n2.  Blendini\n3.  Misto\n4.  Gelati\n5.  Sundae\n6.  or the plain frozen custard or italian ice\n\nThe next day, I caught myself thinking about one... LOL!"
3,"My first time into a Pita Jungle in a few years, and now I'm a fan. Shwarma wrap was excellent but the garlic dip won over our whole table."
3,All the services offers are good here
0,"My wife and I always heard good things about this place.  We were wanting to go to Tagliani's, but thought we should try Native New Yorker for once, to see what the hype was about.  We were sat quickly and the lady seemed pretty nice.  Unfortunately she rushed us through our decisions and never offered any helpful options or features/benefits.  Happy hour lists appetizers being half off, but that's only some of them, and conveniently, the three I was considering were those.  I understand there are small prints on deals at times so that could easily be overlooked.  \n\nThe buffalo chicken dip appetizer we ordered was really good, but only worth $4 maybe $5 size-wise and could have been a lot better without the chunks of chicken.  \n\nMy wife ordered the veggie calzone with pepperoncinis and mushrooms.  When this came out we were both impressed with the size, but the bread didn't have much flavor.  Along with this, recotta cheese was a very \""strange\"" cheese to include being that its so grainy and overpowering.  It ruined the calzone for me altogether.  \n\nI ordered 18 wings on the bone.  6 suicide, 6 hot, and 6 pineapple teriyaki.  The wings had a good amount of chicken, more than any other restaurant, but the sauces ruined it for me again.  I can handle a lot of heat so my opinion may differ from others.  The suicide sauce wasn't very hot, but there were so many red pepper seeds everywhere and they were actually pretty gross, unless doused in ranch.  I felt they tried so hard to make them hot, they ignored the taste factor altogether.  The hot wings were very good and decently spicy.  The pineapple teriyaki wings were ok, but seemed almost soggy because of possibly soaking the wings in the sauce for hours, absolutely doused.  I'm not sure which wings caused it, and I NEVER get heartburn, but I did here.  \n\nWhile we were waiting for the bill, we realized our server was the only serving the entire restaurant.  I understand this isn't her fault, but the restaurants.  The bill finally came, she had overcharged us for the calzone.  All minimal things that could be overlooked, but so many that it ruined the entire experience.  \n\nWith waters and those meals the total was $30.20.  I tipped $5 and got the hell out of there.  Should have gone to Tagliani's.  I took the extra food home, not to waste, but it just sat there in fear of heartburn again.\n\nIf you go for drink and wings, I imagine it could be somewhat of an enjoyable scene being the bar top tables are all close and near the bar and there are tv's everywhere.  \n\nI would have given 2 stars, but my stomach hurts now."
1,"Not bad- for a food court pizza.  I could barely taste the pepperoni on this pie, but the overall flavor was decent.  The price was rather excessive- $5.95/slice. I guess Bonanno's wants to provide a real Big Apple experience: NY-style pizza and a mugging at the cash register.  Still, it beats the hell out of starving."
3,"Want to know what the best tasting thing in Vegas is at 3:30AM after hours of sinister fun? \n\nThe Full Montagu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=0hAaWj1C6H_DdxKTKrNxvA\n    \nAs you can see, The Full Montagu is not an adult themed show featuring scantly clad sexy boys shaking their junk for the masses. This Full Montagu is a big, warm, mouthwatering sandwich packed with freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomatoes and Earl's Mustard Sauce (I also add banana peppers). This sandwich is perfect. It's salty. It's sweet and because I added peppers, it's also slightly spicy. And the bread it's served on, oh that bread is great too. Lightly toasted on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. \n\nBesides the FM, Earl also has a good amount of other amazing tasting sandwiches, both hot and cold, like their Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Cannonballs, both of which I sampled before (at the location in FL).  They also have salads, wraps, chips, tasty desserts and even breakfast Sammie's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw\n\nThe Vegas location of Earl is conveniently located inside the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Freaking sweet. \n\nAnd last but not least, the prices here are super cheap, which is also a major plus in case you pulled a Clark Griswold and lost your life savings at the blackjack tables and only have a few bucks left to your name. I love Vegas Vacation. It's hilarious. \n\nAnyways, to sum it all up ya gotta check out Earl of Sandwich while you're in LV. \nIt rocks! Oh, and Eugine, baby, I thought of your handsome mug every time I walked by Earl."
4,"I've eaten at some great places, and this is a GREAT place! The food was inventive and delicious. The courses were well paced, portioned, and the service was great. There was often some air of pretension, but what's a person to do at that price point?\n\nFirst, the drinks. We spent a moment at the bar and found the cocktail program had recently been taken over by a new bartender. We tried a few of the classics from the menu and they were fine. Then, we tried a few of the drinks she was \""giving a shot\"" for the new menu. They were excellent. Go sit at the bar and drink - drink your socks off! The great shame is that when you're at the resort alone you cannot go eat at their bar - which remains empty at the low season.\n\nThe menu is immediately odd to read and it takes a little guidance from your service staff to understand. Once you've gotten your bearings on the sizing, courses, tasting menu options... there are a lot of great options. I enjoyed this as I often find that restaurants of this type offer a restrictive menu that boarders on, \""we know what's best.\"" \n\nWe wandered through several courses that were each splendid. The spices were a great blend of classic flavorings and local inspiration. The veggies, seafood and game were all exceptionally fresh and well prepared. The service was prompt and informed. \n\nThe wine list here was very nice and accessible. Some familiar bottles and a few more interesting selections. I do, however, warn you that the decanter is a piece of theater. It looks like the murder weapon in a futuristic space drama - and I was afraid of it. :) \n\nWhen in Phoenix you should go to Kai. Keep your group small and it won't disappoint. I would advise calling ahead, as the kitchen will not sit more guests than they are staffed for. I was at first annoyed, because I could see empty seats while I waited.... but, I got to try the cocktails that I so loved and when we did sit (not long after) the timing was impeccable."
1,"Maybe I'm from L.A. and know what good chinese food should taste like...maybe good chinese food places I know don't wow you with decor and cleanliness...maybe I just like my chinese food cheap and greasy.\nWe had a rather large group so we had around 7 dishes or so.  Walnut Prawns were pretty good, strange to have such a large prawn used in this dish but was cooked well, it was fresh, however, needed a bit more flavor.  The hot pot cod was the highlight, soft, flavorful and great texture.  The duck crepe appetizer was a very good start as well.  After that everything was either bland, cold, or just seriously something you could get at a regular chinese restaurant.  For these prices you should be WOW'd (at least taken on some culinary adventure, not just a two dish tour) by more than just fancy architeture...IN ADDITION, we ordered Hennessy Paradis shots and they tasted stale and not a $55 shot of cognac."
3,"I like this place. The current band they have is \""China\"", and they are very good. The lead singer is very funny and has a great voice. They play the top hits (Bruno Mars, Rihanna, etc) as well as some great old R&B/Soul (Dazz Band, Cameo, etc). There is no cover--just walk in and have a seat. The \""ladies of the evening\"" are usually hanging out over by the bar. The one drawback to this place is the cocktail service: S L O W. If the band's last set is at 1:15AM, the waitresses are cleaning up and figuring out the bills at around 12AM. You can't order a drink to save your life---they will disappear behind the bar and pretend to be working. It's been like this as long as I've been stopping by there (5+ years). So my advice is to grab a drink from the bar yourself, OR, stop by another bar and then bring it in with you---you just can't rely on cocktail service in this bar. But that issue aside, it's a pleasant place to listen to some great music for free."
4,"I've used a few locksmiths in the past and all have been acceptable but that's about it.  Jeff, on the other hand, effin ROCKS!  I called him to rekey all of the locks in my house on a Saturday afternoon.  He agrees to come over in an hour and a half.  Same rate on weekends as during the week.  He was running 15 minutes late and called me prior to let me know.  Courtesy goes a long ways with me so I am liking this guy already.  \n\nJeff shows up at 2:45PM and is ready to roll.  I have Baldwin deadbolt locks that key on both sides.  They are a bit sensitive to say the least.  9 locks and 6 keys and 10% discount for mentioning Yelp.  One lock is really old and he made it work after spending an extra hour on it for no additional charge.  He cares that the work is done right and the customer is happy.  He makes your keys on site and they all work perfectly.  Extremely nice person, exceptional service, great skills and he will treat you right.  Thanks Jeff!"
3,"Contrary to most reviewers, I had a great experience with SuperShuttle going there and back. Going there, my SuperShuttle was on time and they even notified me by cell to let me know what time they'd arrive. Going back home, I was delayed and had missed my original SuperShuttle but I was able to catch a different one just as they were about to leave. The SuperShuttle agent who was at the airport was super nice and said they were around 24/7 (so I'm not sure why the other reviewers had a different experience...)? It was about 11:10pm."
1,Atmosphere was great and rolls were pretty good but service was terrible. Had to ask for water twice. Had to hunt down a server to get our check.
0,"If I could give negative stars, I would... First off, all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER, but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered. Then our orders started getting messed up (one time there was a whole burger missing) and then this girl started answering the phone to take orders that I couldn't understand and she couldn't understand me. Today I have OFFICIALLY HAD ENOUGH!!! We called in our order (keeping it as simple as possible), they have stopped carrying Mr. Pibb (which is my friend's fav) and talked to me like I was an idiot about it. FOR ONCE I was given a short & reasonable estimated delivery time... Then my phone rang and I was told that my order would have to be picked up if we still wanted it & they were under new management and will no longer be delivering to our office b/c it's too far away... Meanwhile another group JUST ordered from them on Monday! And our whole office gives them a LOT of business and they just dumped us like that? Nope... Never again..."
4,"My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. \nFrom the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous deserts, this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. \nLocated in the French quarter, l'express is a small restaurant that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.\nThe food is amazing but be sure to order l'ile flottante before they sell out and don't forget the cheese and wine to finish off the evening."
0,"This place has gone downhill with its level of service. Rooms and location are great, the Wynn / Encore is obviously a great property with great restaurants and venues, but this place is consistently understaffed. Wait 30 minutes in line to check in at the hotel. Wait another 20 minutes in line at the concierge to get your boarding pass (hotel kiosks were not working), wait 15 minutes at taxi line because there is only 1 guy working the taxi stand (plenty of cabs, guy just only loaded up one cab at a time AND gave me lip when I asked him why he wasn't moving up 2 cabs at a time for loading). \n\nIn short, you'll have a good night but have a good shot of going postal by the time you leave."
0,"OMG they did it again. I was told I would be receiving THREE water bottles on Sept. 6 and just came home to find 4 water bottles at my door. Today is Aug. 22. These people just can't get it together. I have like 8 empty water bottles that I would really like to get rid of, but they can't even get their schedule right. Also, I still have yet to be refunded for the amount they charged my account and it's a week later. Canceling their service all together. Don't even bother with them.\n\n8/28: I called them regarding the bottles they dropped off and they sent someone to pick them up the next day. BUT GUESS WHAT? They still charged me for those 4 bottles they picked up. I wouldn't have even seen the charge if I wasn't monitoring by account after the first 50 goof ups. How much common sense do you need to realize to cancel the charge too if the bottles are picked up? Then the doofus had enough guts to ask me if I wanted to purchase tea for my next delivery, yeah right! If you are crazy enough to have their service, be prepared to hold their hands through the process because it's clear that ALL of them don't know what they are doing."
2,Okay it's a cool looking building with a nice little history. Other than that why are people peeing their pants for this place?\n\nI admit we only ordered fried pickles (which were good) so perhaps the food is superb. The beer selection was subpar (something I consider vital to have a good bar; either that or really really cheap specials). \n\nI'm glad I went once. Likely not again.
3,"I LOVE YOU IN N OUT!!\nI was introduced to In N Out on a trip to Cali, haven't gotten over it!\nThis is a \""must stop\"" spot, every time we're in Vegas.  Usually about twice a day!\nI love your cute little codes and \""secret menu\"" that just happens to be posted through your site!\nTHANK YOU!"
4,"One of my new favorite places for Sunday brunch! Their drink specials are awesome, food's always great, service is also above expectations, overall a definite recommendation. Can't go wrong with what you order, whether its a burger, breakfast brunch, huge salads, all of it worth the money without breaking bank."
1,The 2 stars is not for service or price but for the donuts. I am nor have I ever really come to dunk in donuts and now I remember why. The quality or freshness of the donuts aren't great. They are OK better than a store boxed donut. Not a huge donut fan to begin with but I remember donuts I have eaten being better. Service was great and they were very friendly. Love their coffee and the fact that they now sell the coffee in their store but that's about it. The donuts weren't fresh when I went in. Could have been the time of day not sure bit I would think they should taste fresher than the did.
3,"I don't know how this nice, but not too expensive restaurant right on the canal in The Venetian got so overlooked, but the three of us were seated right away on Valentine's Day.  We weren't in the \""patio\"" (along the canal), but were beneath a graceful arch and close enough to see the gondolas drifting by - actually they were maneuvering quite a bit because it's near the embarkation point.  In fact, the only thing separating us was a small group celebrating a wedding - I thought it a very suitable venue for a Vegas reception....more of a choice to forego the big church wedding and Italian honeymoon instead of a we-can't-afford-it substitute.  Well, that's the vibe I got since they had obviously put in a lot of attention to detail with the nicest spot, table set up, cake table, etc.  Well, it lent some romance to our dinner since we weren't a menage a trois, but there with our teenage son.  The menu was very tempting - there were a few things we couldn't decide between.  Looking over at the next table, I recommended that my son order a dish full of shell fish, chicken skewers, and delicious looking bread; it turned out not to be quite enough for him.  The ceviche appetizer was sufficient as an entree for me though - the tuna was good, the shrimp and olive too salty, and the third not memorable.  Oh, another diner came over and asked me what I thought of it, so the dishes match the menu description very accurately!  My husband had the succulent pork, and we shared a carafe of strong (I felt) sangria.  It would have been nice if chips and salsa were included instead of being offered separately on the menu (duh, restaurateurs, I probably could have handled more sangria then).  I'm recommending it for kids also because watching the boats is pretty entertaining, it's noisy anyway, and I imagine the railings are close enough that they can't slip through.  I think this place was mentioned in one of the in-room magazines, but in this case, it wasn't all hype.  Besides the tastiness, the setting and presentation make it truly special."
3,"First, the good:\n\n+RSSC is a lot more travel-friendly for us east-siders than BASF up in the far north.\n+The RSOs are very strict (as they should be) but not confrontational. If you're stupid enough to argue with an RSO, then I don't know what to tell you except to find an uncontrolled shooting spot. And if you feel an RSO is being unprofessional, tell the rangemaster.\n+The range fee is entirely reasonable. The cost of a single annual membership is equal to a monthly visit for a year, so if you go more than once per month, it's a good deal.\n+The sandbag rests are most helpful for those of us who don't want to invest in a Lead Sled or similar, nor deal with the hassle of hauling the thing to the range and back.\n+Decent selection of targets at very cheap (and on the honor system) prices.\n\nNow, the not so good:\n\n-The parking lot's proximity to the main range means you'd better damn well put your ears on before you get out of your car, and make sure the windows are rolled up before you leave the paved road.\n-Ditto the check-in office, which makes conversing with the guy in the office a huge PITA.\n-The shooting stands are pretty closely spaced. If you happen to end up next to someone shooting a heavy caliber (or even an AR) with a muzzle brake (which brings up a point, who the hell needs a recoil reduction device on a freakin' AR in the first place?), you *will* feel it.\n\nAll told, RSSC is a damn good range and highly recommended."
2,"As soon as I walked in to the dining area, I noticed how stuffy the place was and why -- the windows don't open! Lucky for us, we were able to get a table on the patio for lunch.\n\nOnce sat, it took far too long to even get acknowledged by the server. So minus one star for that.\n \nMy burger was pretty good, but only because the beef in it was outstanding and perfectly cooked. The lack of even the most basic accouterments; e.g. pickle, tomato, and lettuce, though left it pretty underwhelming. When I grill burgers at my house or even at a tailgate, they're better dressed than this PB&J of burgers. Minus one star."
2,"Decent food and prices, but there are other places nearby that provide higher quality at a lower price."
2,"Good vodka drinks, but as a vodka-hater, I couldn't get into this place.  The bar space was packed even in the late afternoon and we ended up pushed over into corner.  We only stayed for a drink and a half before going to the bar at the restaurant where we were waiting for a table."
3,"I made an appointment based on the great reviews here. I just moved to Spring Valley from the NW part of town and didn't want to drive to Summerlin to see my previous dentist. When I arrived, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Tounian was thorough and explained all options to me about my teeth and root canal procedure. He offered a orthodontist consultation when I told him I was sick of my front, crowded teeth looking like a bunch of Mexicans crammed into a Honda Civic. I will be back to finish my dental work with these guys. Cheers!"
2,Cannot see how they got these many great ratings. Had a signature hot pastrami sub and a salad. Sub was just ok. Sausage just in the middle where they cut the sandw. The rest was just tasteless coleslaw. \nSalad was as cold as it would be shortly before freezing temp. and therefore not pleasant. Salad sauce was prepacked ready mix. \nNot much better than large chains but also not cheap. There are tons of better sandwich shops out there in the country... But maybe not in LV.
0,No!! Bad!! Please make an appearance here only if:\n\n-You are from UC Irvine\n-You like gogo dancers in sparkling leopard bikinis\n-You do not want to dance. At all. (Bouncers flash flashlights at you and will hassle you along the walkway. Dance floor is about 10 sq ft.)\n-You still want to stand in line for a crap club
4,Had an excellent meal here this past Friday night. We sat on the patio as the temperature had dropped and clouds came rolling in. Took a few to get seated but well worth the wait. I had the seared toro nigiri which was full of flavor highly recommended. I tried the salmon wraps which werent what i expected but still tasted good. My friend ordered the Northern Pike which was slightly fishy but had a great texture to it and tasted great. I also had the oysters on ice which came out ice cold and very fresh and tasty. Everything is a la carte here and can get a little pricey after all the sake an sapporo ; )\n\nI highly recommend to anyone that wants really fresh sushi. Be prepared to wait as the food can take awhile for preperation but it is well worth it. They do a good job of brining the food out slowly so you never have a ton of stuff on your table at once.
4,"We were looking for a brunch place that would take reservations for our party of 10 so we didn't have to wait hours to celebrate my mother's 83rd birthday. The Gilbert House set us up on the patio with lovely table and wonderful welcome for us. The staff was excellent and attentive even on a busy morning, and the food was perfect. The cottage setting is charming, and we highly recommend Gilbert House."
4,"4.5 stars rounded up due to a good deal!\n\nThis place must have just opened up days ago.  I ordered a personal size pizza for $5.  The crust is similar to flat bread and was cooked to perfection.  The crust was crispy without being burnt and the cheese was of good quality.  The sauce tasted homemade.  The pepperoni could have been of higher quality but was fine.  Many people may think it's a bit on the small side, but i will take quality over quantity any day."
0,"This is absolutely my most favorite place for gnocchi....  The bartender ruined every ounce of my enjoyment!  \nTypical middle aged, ugly, gross, miserable, divorce who hates her job and apparently needs to make her customers feel like shit!  Do not come here!!!!  It sucks!!!"
2,Yes it is in a sketch part of town.\nBut! The beer is great and a knowledgeable passionate group of people await to tell you about the brewing process.\nNot sure of tasting hours and what not but I went here for a tasting event and enjoyed everything from the Blonde to the oatmeal stout.
1,"My experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best.  I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as \""chow mein.\""  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I'll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler."
3,"Burrito Bandito looks like a burrito place. It has all the trappings of a Mexican eatery; kitschy art depicting a man in a sombrero, horchata on tap, the sound of sizzling meat in the background.\n\nThey even have a menu posted on the wall that tells you all the various burritos it makes.\n\nBut Burrito Bandito is not a Mexican eatery.\n\nIt's a giant middle finger made of drywall.\n\nSure, the sign says \""Home of the Baby Bandito\"" but what it really means is \""Fuck you, Taco Bell across the parking lot. Fuck you and your blatant mockery of our culture's food. Fuck you and your 99 cent hamburger helper burritos. We will not stand for this assfuckery. We will make real Mexican food. You know, the kind where you have to roll your r's just to pronounce it. We'll serve it in a low key yet reasonably aesthetically pleasing dining room of unsanded wooden tables and metal chairs. And charge our patrons an understandably larger price for our food because it's homemade which is totally opposite of your food.\""\n\nAt first you might be put off.\n\nYou'll be saying \""Whoa, Burrito Bandito. What's the deal? What's with the 'tude?\""\n\nAnd then you, on the suggestion of someone who knows best, order a plate of baby banditos.\n\nOne taste of those perfectly tiny chimichangas smothered in jalapeno cream cheese dip and you'll be in the know, man.\n\nYou'll know the score.\n\nAnd before you know it you're ordering off the menu with reckless abandon.\n\nFuck you, GI tract, you'll say.\n\nI want Huevos Rancheros with the hottest salsa they have...at 3 in the afternoon. \n\nI want an El Patron burrito with a side order of baby banditos.\n\nGive me the carna asada tacos, and you know what, screw the Mexican rice. Give me a double order of refried beans, baby. \n\nAnd you better believe I want sour cream in my burrito.\n\nI want the guy in the cubicle next to me to suffer.\n\nAnd when some jabroni walks in, looks at both BB menu and the \""Faty Daddy\"" menu (that's how insane Burrito Bandito is. It's two restaurants in one. It's got split personalities) and asks aloud \""Hmmmm, do I want a burger?\""\n\nYou'll think to yourself \""No, you don't want a fucking burger. If you did you would've gone to McDonald's or Jack in the Box.\""\n\nAnd then you'll realize that you said it out loud. But you won't care. He ain't going to start shit.\n\nThat El Patron burrito you're eating could choke a donkey. There's no way this candyass is going to mouth off to you when you are so obviously reeking of badassery.\n\nIn closing, Burrito Bandito is a loose-cannon burrito shop that doesn't play by the rules.\n\nI'll take \""Awesome Campaign Slogan Ideas Not Tried Yet\"" For 500, Alex."
0,I was there Tuesday. I got my room thru Vegas dot com. I paid $41 and change. It was paid in full. Well it was paid in full after they hit me with a $20 resort fee. When I checked in I was given room 5155 on the 5th floor only to have a broken leaky A/C unit. After 3 phone calls and waiting 3 hours a guy came to fix it but I had been told my room would be changed. Funny how my new room would take longer to get the keys for then the A/C guy would come to work on the A/C. Poor guy had to sit in a pool of water to fix the A/C. When I finally got the keys to the new room 20145 I found that the tv remote was missing. You can't change the channels on the tv without the remote. An hour after calling the remote arrived. In that hour I noticed the wall paper falling off the wall and major water damage to the bathroom door. The room wasn't very clean. I don't know how MGM runs their hotels but when Circus Circus owned the Luxor it was never this bad. After all was said and done and all the complaints all I got was a crappy breakfast buffet. I asked if I could get a perk for liking them on Facebook and was told no I asked what about yelp? Nothing. I was having a great trip till I got to Luxor. I paid 3 star prices for a 1/2 star stay. I don't think I will ever go back to Luxor. Well off to Facebook to warn people there.
4,"I have taken my used jewelry to other buyers before. My less-than-stellar experiences with the others left me a bit skeptical and very cautious in who I trust with my jewelry. One of \""Jim's\"" competitors tried to tell me my white gold, diamond, and sapphire necklace was essentially worthless junk, and That I should take their $30 dollars, as that would be my best offer.  It seemed some of their other Customers had come across their jewelry in less than honest manner, and they were reliant upon the customers willingness to accept next to nothing for their jewelry. I did not do business with them that day and I never will, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth regarding jewelry resale.  \n\nDiamond Jim rectified this, since the moment I walked in I was put at ease by their friendliness and professionalism. Jim's shop is on the small side, but it is CLEAN and space is well-utilized (i.e. Display cases weren't crammed full of unnecessary crap, this can be so overwhelming.) Staff members were openly talking to each other and customers, no hushed whispers to each other, or snobbish formality, which had always made me uncomfortable in other shops. Everyone warmly greeted my boyfriend and I, asked how I could be helped, and directed me to take a seat when I was ready. \n\nMarsha  got us started while we waited for someone to appraise my piece. She is an absolute joy, knowledgeable on her product, the kind of person you feel like you've known a lifetime.  She was just so patient with me, pulling out everything I asked without the least bit of frustration. (There were a lot!) She made some suggestions but never pressured me, answering every question I had. \n\nThey have a huge selection at Diamond Jim's, there is something there for everyone. High-end pieces, turquoise and Native American jewelry, and excellent quality lower-end pieces. I fell in love with a vintage red ring, it was immediately polished on-site for me. They had such a great trade-in policy in place, I had to take advantage of it. \n\nThe necklace I had mentioned before was appraised by the shop owner, Ron. He tested the gems and gave me a very fair price. In addition to the trade-in deal they offer, I couldn't have asked for anything more. He wrote a check right then and offered to cash it for me as well. They aren't looking to make the 300-400% retail mark-up I've found near-everywhere else I have gone. These are honest and up front people, their profit relying on their incredible customer service to create return customers. Ron's and the shop's \""story\"" as a family owned and operated business certainly resonates with me, as the daughter of small-business owners, I love to see the  \""little guy\"" make it against the corporate giants. \n\nDiamond Jim's is not a some sleazy pawn shop for unsavory characters, and it's not a  hoitty-toitty overpriced, stiffly formal national chain either. They are finally a jewelry shop where I feel I will be treated fairly and with good old-fashioned care and consideration as any business should operate. I've already sent someone over to them. The shop's atmosphere makes me feel like I'm visiting old friends, literally, such a hidden-gem. Stop in, you wont go anywhere else after working with Diamond Jim's."
4,"I love this bar!  The pulled pork sandwich is delicious! ...and I'm picky about my pulled pork sandwiches.  There are different rooms that each have their own feel.  There is a great seating area outside, although the cigarette smoke can often linger and make it nasty to be out there.  Its just a relaxed bar where real people go to have a good time.  Love it."
0,"Ate here today and have been here plenty of times before. unfortunately the food quality has come way down and the service was very  very bad, so much so that we will never go back. Was always one of our top choices for Korean BBQ, but now toward the bottom of our list. First time we have been here where restaurant was empty.  And now I know why."
0,"It was Friday night in surprise and most of the restaurants were packed.  I remembered seeing some flyers for this restaurant at my work and figured we would give it a try.  We arrived at a very very empty restaurant which again for Surprise on a Friday night is not normal and probably not a good sign.  We walked in and there was one couple eating and the rest of the place was empty.  We stood at the door where a host or someone should have been and no one was there.  We waited about 10 minutes and nobody showed up to seat us.  Therefore we left.  I would have liked to have tried this place, i appreciate that they came to my place of work to promote the restaurant, but I guess they were too busy serving their empty restaurant to seat us.  No wonder the place was empty."
3,"Another small plates joint.  I love small plates and sharing.  I also love enomatic machines.  They ensure that the wine comes out at the right temperature.  Red wine is always served too warm.  I had the Blue-Eyed Boy Shiraz by Mollydooker and a nice Malbec.  Both were excellent.  Some of the wines are not served in the enomatic machine.  Make sure to order from the enomatic machine.  And ignore the $120 glass of wine.  I don't know what's up with that.  The rest of their wine is reasonably priced.\n\nOur bartender, turned server as the night went on, was also excellent. Very attentive and anticipated our needs. We tried the bacon wrapped dates, mushroom grits, and the prosciutto flatbread.  I could have lived without the bacon-wrapped dates... too large and mushy. you have to cut them in half to eat them. The blue cheese fondue the dates came with didn't have much flavor to it.  I like Firefly's bacon-wrapped dates better with the almond in the middle for some crunch.  I think our bartender did too, because he asked if we'd tried Firefly's.  The mushroom grits were to die for... so tasty with the truffle oil.  I adore grits.  And the prosciutto flatbread was also very, very good.  Lots of prosciutto with arugula made for a nice balance of flavors.  The flatbread is huge compared to the other dishes, so beware.\n\nThe desserts were ok. There was a toasted poundcake with strawberry and sour cream ice cream that sounded great but turned out to be underwhelming.  The poundcake just tasted stale and the sour cream ice cream just tasted like vanilla.  We also tried the beignets which were just beignets.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nI like the ambience, but I would suggest sitting farther away from the door.  Maybe at the bar in the back or at a table.  At one point, these kids coming from the pool in swimsuits decided to play in the revolving glass door... and the hostess and their mom let them.  In about 1 minute, one of the kids got slammed in the door by the other kids.  Screaming ensued. The mom couldn't figure out how to get the kid out of the revolving door for a while.  So annoying.  I think the hostess should have put a stop to that before it happened.  It was pretty predictable.\n\nLater in the evening some drunk guys in t-shirts and shorts came in, falling all over the place and asking for Coors Light.  Charming.  Just get a table in the back if you are looking for ambiance that does not involve the regular Las Vegas tourist. \n\nIt's a cute spot that has potential."
2,"Located inside the Miracle Mile this little meatball shop is a nice and quick delight if you wanted something different for a quick bite.  \n\nNeedless to say, the meatballs here were nice and tender.  Along with the meat sauce I thought it made a nice treat.  I wouldn't say it's mind blowing away crazy like I've never had a good meatball or marinara, but this will hit the spot.  I would definitely recommend the meat sauce ( yeah I know over the meatballs! )  -- In the end, the place serves up meatballs and salad like a fast food joint.  Service is decent and overall and good experience! - Enjoy"
1,"Maybe it was an off night when I went, but I felt it was a bad dining experience. And I say this fully loving Rooster's. We went for a friends b-day, his choice. He had gone before and him and his wife raved about it. Another friend and I were skeptical from the start, nothing on the menu online jumped out at us, options seemed limited and not exciting, but we went because it was not our b-day, not our choice. \n\nSo when we got there they had put some confetti pieces on the table in honor of the b-day, thought that was nice. It was pretty dead in there on a Wednesday except for some private party that ended up taking away from our service. The decor was awful!!! My friend and I couldn't get over how busy/tacky it was. He said it was like Disney on crack or something along those lines. \n\nOn to the meal. We started with a bottle of Sancerre, it was good. We had 2 servers at this point and it wasn't clear who was in charge of what. We then ordered some apps. I tried the fried oyster salad and there was two crab cakes ordered. My salad was the highlight of the whole meal. The fried oysters were great and the creamy balsamic dressing on the salad was very good. I tried a bite of the crab cake, it was fine but nothing to rave about. \n\nFor entrees I had the halibut, 2 had beef cheeks, and one veal. We also got sides of lyonnaise potatoes and some vegetables. My halibut was a tad fishy, which I have never experienced with halibut before. Overall it was prepared well but I have had better. The veal was apparently great but I didn't try it. The boys who had the beef cheeks did not enjoy them, and both felt started to feel ill while still at the restaurant, to the point where alcohol was pushed aside and club soda was ordered for the unhappy tummy's! \n\nFor dessert the birthday boy got a choice of something on the house, he picked the coconut cake and we also got the pistachio creme brulee and a cheese plate. Sweet desserts were fine, again nothing amazing. The cheese got dropped off w/o explanation of what they were, and I believe there were 5 different types. It came with long thing bread sticks that made no sense with the way the cheeses were cut, and its not like any of them were of the spreadable variety. We also had no plates to eat with as all had been cleared. I grabbed a passing server/runner/not sure, and asked him for plates for the table. He took one from a table behind us and gave it to me and ran off, wow that was helpful for the 4 of us. Then I got the attention of someone else for an explanation of what the cheeses were he rambled off some names in French we'd never heard of and took off again, still not knowing what we were going to eat. \n\nWe were actually all laughing at this point because it was just a disaster. Jim Noble actually happened to be there, not cooking, so you'd think they would be working to impress him, but alas that was not the case. Also, when we ordered a 2nd bottle of wine they were out of what we had so he offered a similar Sancerre. And when he asked us if we enjoyed it and did we notice a big difference and I said I hadn't he actually made some sarcastic comment about me being lower class or something!! He laughed as it was meant to be a joke, but hey bud we aren't pals and you really aren't at liberty to talk to me like that. I could not wait to leave. \n\nSo we left after paying waaay too much for such a below average meal and continued to laugh incredulously about what just took place. The boys were still suffering from those cheeks the next day and it was pretty much decided that this didn't warrant a 2nd visit, though I hear its since closed, so no need to worry about that anyway!"
3,"Quick Summary: We went on a Sunday Morning during a busy time and expected to wait. They seated us within the predicted time frame and promptly took our orders. The ambiance is welcoming and bright with large open windows that nicely blend the outdoors with the indoors. The servers were friendly and the food was great. I've listed some pros and cons below. Overall we were very satisfied. \n\nPros:\n*Ambiance - Cool retro Jetsons \n-like theme.  \n*Could get coffee and specialty drinks from the bar while waiting to be seated.\n*Gluten free pancakes for adults and kids and the kids plates were completely polished off because they loved them so much. \n*Excellent fluffy and tasty pancakes. \n*3rd Street Chai (aka their Honey Vanilla sweet chai) was really good...so good my wife ordered a second one. \n*Orange juice was fresh and delicious. \n*Pineapple upside down pancake was great. \n*Balloon animals for the kids on this Sunday morning made smiles and gave us something for the kids to take home. \n*Friendly servers. \n\nCons:\n*Music in restaurant a little too loud for normal conversation and made it hard to hear the server. \n*Table Turn Times slow. Many tables were empty for up to 5 minutes waiting to be bussed after a party left. Of course, when you're starving, even a few minutes seems like forever. \n*Not enough sauce initially on my Strawberry Rhubarb pancakes. \n*The strawberry rhubarb pancake only came with a blended sauce and no real strawberries. \n\nGo and enjoy!"
1,"We were lured in by some gentleman promoting this place. He got us in for free and we didnt have to wait in line so why not. When we got in, the decoration was great and the lounge area welcoming. We set foot in the dance room and it was all bad. Seriously, it smelled really bad that I had to run out of there in fear of throwing up. I didnt end up tossing my cookies BUT clearly the cigarette, marijuana, throw up smell that overtook the dance floor that night was extra ripe. Gross."
4,nevada family service is on the corner of sahara and eastern. sus amigo income tax is located about 100 yards down from the northeast corner. do not go to nevada family service. (wrong picture)  make sure you ask for carmelo montti
0,"The food was delicious, however the service was horrible. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to bring tomato juice for one of our partymembers as well as charging another one of our partymembers 60 dollars for french fries on their debit card."
0,In my opinion Middle Eastern food that is of high quality is by far the hardest thing to find in this town.\n\nI only came to this place because I saw another reviewer mentioned it in the same sentence as Haji Baba. To even talk about this place in the same sentence is an insult. Gyro meat was terrible and the Schwarma was totally dry.\n\nIf you want quality Middle Eastern food you have to go to Tempe or Scottsdale. Haji Baba or Byblos in Tempe or Mijana in Scottsdale.
0,If I could give no stars I would. We hadn't been to BLD in about a year because the food was so awful but we came back to give it a second try. Huge mistake. Food was cold. Tasted like it came out of plastic wrapper in the freezer. Disgusting. And none of us feel well after our meal. \nFriends side of potatoes took FOREVER like 25 minutes forever. Then they wouldn't take it off of the bill. \n\nService was extremely slow. \n\nWe will not be returning. Ever.
1,Standard to slightly better corporate-style Mexican fare. Overpriced margaritas are probably the best thing about the Sky Harbor Intl Airport.
1,"I literally have problem every time I come here. The result of my wash is NEVER fully clean, there is always dirt spot or, bird poop, debris on my car after my wash and dry. Oh let me mention, after dropping off to get my car washed my car one time, my battery died...how eventful.\nWhat to expect:\nyou will be interacting with high school barely legal aged workers. They try their best to be competent but I have the feeling that management is just not giving them adequate support and training. \nThe logistics of this place needs to be worked out better."
4,"I thought I'd update my review since there are some recent negatives.  I'll just keep it simple:\nIf you want a good haircut, with an old skool vibe (a la kustom culture, rockabilly, or nostalgia) - this is your place.\nIf you want a basic haircut from experienced barbers with no frills - this is your place.\nIf you want a beer while you wait - this is your place.\n\nIf you want a mediocre \""factory\"" hair cut, done by a talkative, petite lady that won't shut up about her kids, and keeps laughing and gossiping with the 15 other hens in the shop - This is NOT your place. \n\nThe barbers aren't the most talkative?  Big deal.  They cut your hair and do a damn fine job.  The more often you go in, the better the hair cut gets.  You have to wait sometimes?  I see that as a good thing, even if it can be frustrating.  It means a quality local business is doing good, and they're likely to be around the next time you need your ears lowered.  And for the community that admires a nice pompadour, that's a must.\n\nIt's like this:  Great haircut.  Fair price.  Cool atmosphere.  Leave the latte at home.  Put your cell phone away.  Relax.\n\n'Nuff said."
0,"Arrived midweek at 12:30pm.... The fact that the pplace was deserted should have been warning enough, but we had faith in the Yelp reviews and the sticker on the door from Yelp & advertising the best carne asada this side of the border. The carne asada burrito was mostly tasteless, and certainly NOT worth the $8 I was charged for it. Drink choices are limited to bottled Mexican sodas & lemonade or iced tea. Complimentary chips and salsas, on the surface, are a nice add, but the store bought corn chips were stale & the salsas not very good at all.\nI think that \""this side of the border\"" refers to the border between them & the closest Filibertos. Honestly, I have had much better carne asada burritos from Ralphs Rolling Snack Bar & Filibertos, for much less money. I would almost bet that the Coco's in the same plaza could serve up better carne asada.\nThe one redeeming factor was that my friend said his fish taco was very good... Otherwise, I would grant zero stars."
3,"Loved it! So happy to have it in the area...menu looks odd but haven't had a bad item, they know what they're doing. Mahi tacos are the best I've had in Phoenix area. Huge selection of meat (including frog legs) you can pick up for purchase also."
1,"Valiant effort put on by these thespians -- my favourite were the reporter, the sheriff, and Jewel, but more energy should definitely be put into the set, sound (although we did not encounter the catastrophic mic issues reported by other Yelpers), and overall production. Not certain how much I would pay for it (saw it for free from a comfortable booth) if I had to pay, but 55$ per is definitely steep. TIP: There are two-for-one coupons at both Pop Up Pizza and the cupcake place inside Plaza. - E"
3,"Great place to find some tasty goods that are difficult to locate elsewhere! If you are a bit of a fanatic for beer, wine, cheese, baked goods, or some higher end groceries, you will find a lot to be happy about here. They also have great iced tea, italian soda, dinners ready to eat, and a huge salad bar. It's great if you are looking for a light meal and dessert without doing the whole restaurant thing. They have plenty of outdoor seating for you to enjoy what you just purchased.\n\nI have found some oddball stuff here like off-brands of pasta sauce, olive oil, and other \""fine foods\"" as they mention. They also have premium meats and seafood, and hard-to-find things like British banger sausage.\n\nDO NOT buy regular stuff here that you can get at a mainstream grocery store. Their produce and other everyday items are marked up by at least 50% just because you are at AJ's. No sense in paying $2.00 for a can of tuna when the exact same can is 79 cents at Fry's or Safeway."
0,"Ordered Chicken Fried Steak for my free birthday meal. That probably shows my foodie ignorance, as who knows what meat is tucked in that fried, breaded coating with gravy. The whole plate was worse than I remember chow hall food when I was in the military. I sent the iced tea (probably another poor choice) back.\n\n\""How was everything?\"" the cashier asked when I left. \n\n\""Free,\"" I said.\n\n\""Oh good, glad you enjoyed it.\"" \n\nI let it go."
1,"The staff is very nice, but I went in asking for pink and white gel nails and described what I wanted. The girl did a gel base with a gel polish white tip. And when I asked her about the gel white tip she said they don't do that there. Why couldn't she have told me that in the beginning. They look okay, but definitely NOT what I wanted. Buyers remorse - wish I had gone some place else."
1,"Good Location, nice rooms. Check in was a disaster, considering I spoke English. Our person checking us in was not, and did not like that I did not understand her. Had to get another person to translate what I was requesting. NO comps for difficulties. Manager seemed to not want to deal with the situation. Overpriced on a regular day. We got a deal to try out the place since we had heard so much good. Won't go back, so many others that are great. La Quinta has better service at checkin."
1,"Went to the Toringdon location yesterday.  I have been watching for a while, waiting, as I love Peruvian food.\n\nAll in all the place was okay.  Kind of pricey for what you get (eg, 1/4 white same as Roasting Co, but sides are not included).  It had some riffs on Peruvian favorites, but nothing really brought me back to my time there--except for the Inca on the shelve (hopefully nobody actually drinks it).\n\nI don't know if it was that the place was freshly opened but there was a surplus of workers standing around making nuisances of themselves, asking you how you liked things.  One guy asked us 10 times and there were others.  No one bothered to get us more tea, water, etc, just kept coming back and asking if it was all right.\n\nI will go back, but with only okay food and high-ish prices for what you get, it is not a winner (winner chicken dinner ;) )"
0,"The most over priced place I have ever been to! I am talking specifically about the candy store. I bought two bags of candy - one bag of Swedish fish and one bag of peanut butter M&Ms. Together they were over $30. Ridiculous! They were not organic, all natural specialized candies. They were not helping rape victims anywhere in the country or helping starving children. This store is a rip off and is the epitome of greed! There were no prices on the candy and there was a girl standing there telling people to fill their bags up more.. It was fun to look at but DO NOT BUY the candy! The candy in my room at the Cosmo was half as much and that is saying a lot bc we all know how much they up charge items in the room!"
0,"Stop! whats the point of this Hotel? Yes, its on the strip and connected to the Mandalay Bay by a tram... but other then that, I don't see any value to it. It is a sad reminder of Vegas' attempts in the 80's and 90's to lure \""families\"" to Vegas. I am thankful that era is long gone... why we still have the Luxor, Excalibur and Treasure Island is beyond me. I guess that is why you can get rooms for $49 and enjoy gambling with displaced tourists from the Mid West and Florida."
2,"My husband won't eat Asian food, but he will eat her... if that means anything. He loves their garlic shrimp. The sushi is good, but I'm not always in the mood for it and am not super adventurous with it. The sesame chicken is good but a little sweet. We really like the place but don't judge a book by its cover. The joint isn't much to look at but the food is good and the service is great, which is the most important part of a restaurant."
4,AMAZING!! The owner is a delight to talk to and she knows her Vegas history and where every piece has come in from. Every item is also in pristine condition and she takes great care in preparing everything. Definitely a must visit!
4,A fun show in a small venue.  Decided to go at the last minute while sitting in the courtyard in front of Caesars where Serendipity is.  Something for women and men. The acrobatics are pretty awesome and the comedy is truly enjoyable.
4,where do they find the people to work here?\n\nthey are always top noch.  Well done  dudes.
0,"It would be nice to try this place but I the 3 of us drove all the way there  and it was closed, but the business hours in yelp say they are open 3pm to 9pm.\nIt's just very irritating to get there and find out they are closed. Thanks a lot!!!"
1,"Not very good food. Too much $$ for not a very good quality. Biscuits were hard, Caesar dressing watered down and sour. Not very exciting BBQ either. Despite all of that, Elizabeth \""Lizzy\"" was an excellent waitress."
2,"Went for the buffet. Had been there before, didn't like it as much before, but wasn't as bad as I thought it was the 2nd time around. Would have liked a bit more choices for 9 and change I paid for the lunch buffet though.\n\nWill update again if I go for actual entrees. If you go to CMU and are craving Indian food with more choices than the stuff at Resnick and don't mind paying a bit more out of pocket, then do go here. If you are looking for a good Indian buffet with a decent number of choices then you might be better off looking for somewhere a bit further."
0,"This location just opened within the last month.\n\nThe location is new and very clean. \n\nWe went there about 4:30.  They were running a special, all plates $2.00. \n\nWas very concerned that there were many dishes on the belt and not many people in the restaurant.  Also concerned that they were not marking the time on the cards so you can determine how long the dish had been running around on the belt. There were some dishes that clearly did not look like they were fresh.  When avocado is turning brown, that might be an indication??  And when we asked the server why they were not marking the cards, his only response was, \""They are supposed to be.\""\n\nWe had a couple of plates that were questionable.  Ended up limiting ourselves to the dishes that came around that the chef just prepared or we saw were just set out. \n\nOverall, this was not a very good sushi experience.  For someone that is experiencing sushi for the first time, this might be their last two.  I agree with one other reviewer..  There are other good conveyor belt type of places.  Don't be discouraged if this was your first experience.  \n\nProbably will not return. This place made a horrible impression...!!!"
4,"I'm not sure about the previous review because I feel the chicken tenders are absolutely delicious (with the ranch dressing or the aiolli dressing). \nThe batter used is the same used for the fish fry.  \nService:  well, I don't drink at all so I can't speak for the middle section, but every server we have ever had is very attentive.\nBy the way, their salmon dinner is one of the best ever!"
3,"This is the second review of The Dor- Stop, I gave it another star this time.\n\nCanadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.\n\nHe's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says \""Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here\"". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?\n\nI ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.\n\nHe ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.\n\nMy oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.\n\nHe devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.\n\nIt's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town."
3,"Great dj, played really good hip hop. Good crowd all the way around, and my bartender was awesome. You could tell they had good customer service training.\n\nThe Bank salvaged my Saturday night, which started at a terrible spot. I will definitely go back when I'm in town."
1,"I used to come here often...both with the kids for food and also with the guys for drinks at the bar.  Tough to beat $2 Pacificos all night long.  \n\nWe visited last Friday night for dinner at around 7pm and the restaurant was empty.  I believe there was one other table of diners and about 7-8 rowdy drinkers at the bar.  One of the reasons we stopped coming to the bar was they attract a rough crowd.  Tattoos, smoking pot in the parking lot... Not passing judgment... Just not my scene.  \n\nSo tonight we order and sit at our table.  They had one guy working the cashier.  A young guy with black spiky hair.  The same guy was also delivering food to the tables.  Even though the restaurant was empty, he provided such poor service we'll never return to a Vegas Wahoos again.  We'll just wait until we go to Huntington Beach where they do it right.  \n\nWhen he delivered the first portion of our food, I asked him for the green sauce.  He gave me a look as if I was being a pain, but he returned with the sauce.  When he returned with the rest of our order, my son asked for a knife.  He literally rolled his eyes and went straight to the bathroom.  \n\nNow I know it's annoying when guests asked for things...especially when they don't ask for them at the same time, but our whole table was shocked at his response.  We looked at each other and waited to see whether he was going to come back.  Finally my 12 year old son got up and went behind the kitchen area to get his own knife!!!   Hahaha.  Unbelievable.\n\nWhen the guy returned from the bathroom, I figured he would deliver the knife.   Nope...he stood in front of the TV and watched sports!!!  Check out the photo!!!  \n\nThe founder of Wahoo's was here at the grand opening.  He should reconsider his choice for area developer.  They know nothing about customer service."
4,"I must say that I have been here four times in four weeks.  The sandwiches are great.  The bread is fresh and tasty clearly made within hours of serving.  The order is taken right when you walk in, so there is no unnecessary waiting.  Most of the time the line is short and I get served within minutes.  The sandwiches use a reasonable portion of meats and other ingredients which balance the sandwich, not bury it in the bread.  The guys behind the counter know there sandwiches and can answer any if not all questions that you may have.   \n\nI normally get a medium sandwich, the large is just too large (e.g. two meals!).  They also serve Wise brand potato chips from the East Coast which are hard to come by in Phoenix, but not impossible.\nA great place to have a quick lunch that will not have you waiting and keep you satisfied throughout the day.\nMy recommendations................."
1,"This place gets 2 stars because I LOVE the products they sell and sadly have spent over 5k on merchandise from here. (Couches , mac computer, bedroom furniture, 2 sets of Beats by Dre etc) anyways the managment here is horrible and they all have a bad attitude when your in the store for anything but buying products. The sales team make commission so yes they do swarm on you when you get in store . And my biggest pet peave is I got the one salesmen that barely spoke english ! \n\nBut I love the 12-36 months 0 interest so I will bite my tongue and continue to buy :)"
4,Awesome Pulled Pork and Smoked Sausage.  The ribs are great and I love the Mac and Cheese with Waffle Fire.  We get our BBQ fix a couple times a month at minimum..
1,Dumpling skin was too dry & thick. Stuffed ingredients were flavorless. I suggest you to go to Mei Xiang Yuan instead which is on St-Catherine street.
2,"Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner."
1,"Stayed here two months ago on a get away for my anniversary. My boyfriend and I are not super big partiers but figured an affordable vacation to Vegas to see some shows and have fun was in order. We got to the hotel and it wasn't too far off of the strip which was great. Our room was decent. But we had the strangest thing happen, and were not happy with how it was handled. We picked up some things to drink on the way to the hotel. There's a key to lock your fridge, which we had a bottle of vodka in and some beers and we didn't lock it. We came back to the room on our second day there, after only having two or three drinks out of the bottle, we opened up the fridge to find that it was almost empty. This was after our room had been cleaned. It wasn't like this was expensive alcohol but we decided to let the front desk know. You would think they would want to know if someone that works for them may be drinking on the job or taking anything in general. After we let them know the next time we opened the fridge on the next day (also after housekeeping had come) we noticed the vodka all of a sudden had doubled. We let them know it had been tampered with again and then they sent up a security person to our room. Now, I can understand that 99.9% of the time people probably drink it and forget and complain because it's Vegas...and that happens. But that was not the case, I was that .1%. The response we got from the security guy is that we had drank the alcohol and we just forgot, and he said that multiple times. I did NOT appreciate that. It may be silly but that's telling me I'm a liar. We were not asking for anything free, and I am still un-amused by that response. They offered us a free breakfast after we first had mentioned it to them which was lovely...until we got back later in the day and they had messed with it again.  Had we even the littlest doubt that we may have drank it we would not have been complaining. Maybe you have a housekeeper that likes to drink on the job...ever think about that? Won't be back. All it took was an interest in the issue we were having and not telling us it was our fault and it would've been just fine."
2,"It was beautiful venue.  Unfortunately, the occasional plane noise was distracting and during the wedding ceremony someone started to use a power tool of sorts.  It was stopped quickly after but yikes!\n\nIt was clean, welcoming and if I were getting married again I'd consider this location for an indoor wedding then maybe outside for the reception (bc of the noise).\n\nStaff was friendly and professional, Good appearance and helpful. \n\nFood, the food was amazing but I'd recommend not serving finger foods during the cocktail hour that is so greasy.  It was served on a napkin that was soaked with grease.  So, now what do I wipe my hands on?\n\nI hated the chairs at the ceremony.  They weren't very comfortable and I felt like would break.  In the cracks of the chairs you could see old dirt and mud from previous events.  Small attention to detail like that takes the venue up a notch.  \n\nI enjoyed the lights strung on the trees once it was dark.  Added a nice ambiance.  \n\nMy other critiques were of decor here and there which was fine but could have been \""more\"".  I think that was just the discretion of the bride and groom.\n\nGreat place, pleasantly surprised."
4,"What do I have to say about Starbucks? You know who they are, you know what they serve and you can basically expect the same great service throughout the valley. It's Starbucks."
2,"Grande et grosse cha\u00eene! C'est cher! Les cours et les machines sont bien, je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une attente folle pour aller faire de l'elliptique (comme au Cepsum, le complexe sportif de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, tr\u00e8s achaland\u00e9). Cependant, ce qui m'a d\u00e9plu c'est de un le prix! C'est tr\u00e8s cher. De deux, c'est le fiat qu'ils poussent \u00e0 la consommation.

J'ai seulement pris un carnet de 10 passages, ce qui m'a suffit pour tester et me dire que c'\u00e9tait biiiiiien trop cher, au final."
1,"I really wanted to like the place, the customer service was great.  However I will  not be going back, the prices were high and there was nothing special about the sushi and sashimi.  I would rather drive a little farther for sushi elsewhere....."
3,"They open until 5am in the morning. Perfect for the hungry college student. The family who owns this place is hilarious. The person who takes your orders at the window is the husband who encourages you not to get the \""worthless white rice\"" that us Asians love and get the brown rice instead. The wife is equally hilarious. The first time I went we were the only ones in the restaurant except for two other people. One of the guys was getting quite loud and rowdy so the wife threatened to kick him out with a baseball bat.\n\nAs for the food, it's good and fresh. The fried chicken I ordered tasted especially good with the red chili flakes they had at the table. Large portions and filling. Great late-night/super early in the morning meal."
2,I've been to this place a few times and the food is really good but I think it's too expensive for being Mexican food....okay contemporary Mexican food. Name it what you want but I think it's a good $8 caliber food that I paid $15 for.\nThe service has always been good but you better get there early or you will wait and they don't have much room for you to wait in so you will be outside. \n\nThe one thing you do have to try when you get there is the churro in ice cream dessert. That is always the highlight when I go. If you take friends or family I really don't think they will be disappointed but your wallet will.
3,"The myth has finally landed I'm the golden triangle.\n\nI have heard numerous counts of high praise for Nicky's on the North Shore, and they didn't disappoint.  Went early for lunch around 1140 and got right in.\n\nStaff could have been a little more attentive...  it took 5-10 minutes to get our menus and water, but the food more than made up for it.\n\nPork red curry and jalepeno chicken slathered in their assortment of hot oils and dressings can't be overlooked if you like your stuff spicy.\n\nDefinitely will be going back again.\n\nUpdate (second visit):  Went to Nicky's for a second lunch with the fiancee after I ranted and raved to her about the food.  Still rather good, however the service was extremely sub-par.\n\nOn both occasions its been hard to ask for input about the menu, and this time, it apparently landed me with an entree completely different than what I ordered.  The real issue came when I brought it to my servers attention and she accused me of being wrong.\n\nI'm torn because I truly do love the food, but on two occasions now, the service has been below expectations.  I'll probably give it a third try and strike option as I still need to try the pad thai."
4,"I love this place. I come here with the co-workers at least once a week. From the outside it looks like a normal taco shop, the food however is anything but. The caldo de res is just stupid good and the albondigas is litterally the best I've ever had. It looks like the cook ran to a farmers market to buy the vegetables fresh each morning just for the soup. The other food is quite good and always made to order. Not your typical cheese covered run of the mill usual offerings. The salsa bar here is worth a visit alone. For what its worth there is usually 4 of us that go to lunch and not one talks nor offers another a taste of eachothers food. I f they expanded to my neighborhood in the SW I would probably have to start paying rent there."
0,"Worst carwash ever! Over paid not satified they didnt vacum the car, dash not done bunch on young kids dont care. Do not go to this location they suck! I will not go back again."
0,"We have visited the  ahwatukee location twice.  The first time the toppings were sparse but the wings were good.  The second time the  toppings were wrong  on our takeout pizza and they did not show us the pizza as they normally did. We did not realize until we were home and did not call them to complain. Overall their wings are better than you would get at a chain but their pricing on pizza, minimal toppings  and lack to detail will keep this from being our pizza place."
3,"Normally Costco would get an automatic 5 stars from me.  I've only been disappointed a few times with their merchandise, and only once that I can recall on a Kirkland Signature item.  My source for bottled water, soy milk, protein powder, vitamins, paper goods, and cleaning materials.  Great for frozen foods and boxed/canned/bottled foods.  Also a trusted place for me to buy a mattress or small appliances.  If something goes wrong or you don't like an item, their generous return policy (no receipt needed, they'll look it up under your membership number) will refund your money.  However, I must consider the following:\n\nWhat makes this Costco better than your average: There's always parking, even on Black Friday and weekends.  The gas is incredibly cheap ($1.9599 today).  It's very easy to drive up to, with no long, winding ring roads.\n\nWhat makes this Costco worse: The clientele of the mall is not the best (woman screaming in front of Costco today almost caused a panic).  The neighborhood is sketchier than most Costco locations, and the parking lot loiterers reflect this.  There are not as many designer/luxury \""treasure hunt\"" items.  The carts in the parking lot are all over the place and very inconvenient, even more so than standalone Costco locations, but that's the fault of the shoppers here."
4,"Today is Tuesday, I believe. and post office here has very very very good business, which is not good to us :)\n\nMark, who's here walking around, help all the customers one by one. Um... he is a very nice guy, always called ladies as 'young lady'.\n\nPassports sign in windows 1&2\n\nHours: \nMon - Fri 9:00am - 3pm\nSaturday 10:00am - 1pm\n\n\nby the way, 'purple' is NOT allowed :("
0,"I'm only giving one star because Yelp makes you and, well, my rescue dog is still alive, so I guess I should be thankful for that, right?\n\nWrong!!\n\nOn Saturday, July 19th 2014, I brought my current rescue foster to Planet Petopia to look into the boarding services they offered at their facility. The people there seemed nice, albeit Barbara seems to get annoyed if you ask too many questions or give too many directions concerning the care of your pet(s).\n\nSpeaking of directions, according to the dreadful condition my rescue dog was in when she was picked up after just seven days spent at this facility, on Saturday, July 26th 2014, my directions concerning her care were not followed.\n\nMy partner retrieved my dog from Planet Petopia and brought her back to our home for me to prepare her for a home check with a potential adopter. Upon entering our home she was very happy to see me. During our initial round of hugs and kisses I noticed I could feel her ribs and hip bones so I put her back down on all fours to have a better look at her.\n\nAfter closer inspection I discovered the following:\n\n1. She looked emaciated. I could see her ribs, hip bones and shoulder blades. Her face also looked sullen.\n\n2. She was dirty and smelled musty and damp.\n\n3. Her skin in all of the known \""allergy areas\"" was bright pink. Her feet, around her nose area, her eyes were red and her skin was just completely irritated. This leads me to believe she wasn't being fed her sensitive skin and stomach food I provided. Which leads me to my next finding \n\n4. As I was emptying her bag I noticed her favorite toy and blanket were missing. Instead, my partner was given a toy we had never seen before that was unfit for any dog to begin with. I don't think she was ever given her blanket because she has callouses on her legs. It seems as if she spent a good amount of time laying on concrete.\n\n5. Returned to me were 4 out of the 6 cans of wet food I provided for her, along with an almost full container of kibble. Due to her allergy attack and rapid weight loss it is impossible to tell if she was fed a different food or even fed at all.\n\nAfter a few moments she began to cough. At first I paid no mind. When she went into a coughing fit and spewed out white foam and mucous I became worried. I offered her eater and she refused. She went and laid on my couch and napped. I thought maybe it was indigestion or the heat so I let her rest. When she woke up a little while later in another coughing fit I contacted friends. The general consensus was kennel cough.\n\nToday, Tuesday, July 29th 2014 I took my rescue dog to be seen by a veterinarian and she does, in fact, have kennel cough. Along with her ear infection returning, having a fever and being dehydrated.\n\nI do not recommend boarding your pets at this facility. The people there seemed nice enough and their two children are adorable, but they do not care for animals properly and your pets deserve better treatment than they would receive there."
0,"had breakfast there. thought it was better than sitting in dusk inside. terrible eggs, artificial orange juice. expensive"
2,"A bit of a run down, yet still clean, hotel. Front desk service was friendly. Room was on the small size. I requested two beds but was told they were out. Our room came with a sleeper sofa so that was fine for the kids. The entry smelled of chlorine from the nearby pool, and the floor was very wet from patrons who apparently didn't feel the need to dry off before going to their rooms. It would have been nice if the staff had mopped it up. Breakfast was good, with several hot options (waffles, eggs, sausage and potatoes). It was very crowded and the poor man running the breakfast could have used some help, but he was very quick to address and needs. The wifi was strong and easy to connect to. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby.  Overall, it was just a so-so hotel. It could use some updating for sure.  Not worth the 2.5 stars Priceline gave it, but it was safe and clean and had a good breakfast."
4,"Bar none the best.  Our event was so much fun. We got an enhanced package with lights, dancers, an MC and a DJ. Rick was fantastic and the dancers and MC made our party. Our friends and family danced the night away.  I've been to smaller events where Rick was the DJ and that party was a total blast too. These guys rock!"
1,"Great for kids between 5-7 yoa. But any older and the eyes will roll and they will think the rides are babyish. It's nice that parents don't have to pay if they aren't going on the rides.  Make sure to check online for coupons before you go. \nLazer tag is very popular and seemed adequate for the 7 or 8 kids per game. \nThe video arcade games mostly take 2 tokens, about .50 a game."
3,"Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value."
2,"It's an interesting concept: A sushi restaurant that plays loud Mexican music and has banks of big-screen TVs showing sporting events, a holdover from its former life as a sports bar. Interesting, but it doesn't quite gel.\n\nThe sushi was good. The servers were friendly and attentive. The service was fast on our first visit; slower on our second.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian as I am, you might want to ask yourself \""Why am I going to a sushi restaurant?\"" before walking in the door. The menu has almost nothing without fish or other meat. But the server said they would be happy to customize a dish for me, which I greatly appreciated. I ordered the California Roll without crab meat. That's cucumber, avocado, and rice. Not as flavorful as their regular dishes, perhaps. But you become accustomed to making sacrifices when you're a fish out of water, so to speak.\n\nOne of the few other vegetarian offerings on the menu was an edamame appetizer. I ordered it thinking it would be healthy, but it was doused in salt. I don't even want to know how much sodium I ingested.\n\nThe big horseshoe bar from the former sports bar is still there, but no one was sitting at it. The big patio in front of the restaurant is nice and has one fire pit.\n\nIf this restaurant sounds intriguing, I suggest you go there as soon as possible. I can't imagine it will be open a year from now. The people who run the place are trying. They really are. I suspect Senor Sushi's original restaurant in Phoenix is successful. But I don't think Casa Grande is ready for the Mexican sushi concept."
1,"The Service:  Showed up 15 minutes before our reservation of 4 and was seated 45 minutes after our 9:30P reservation that was made 2 months in advance.  We stood outside as group after group was seated before us and was eventually told they all arrived before us; a quick glance at their reservation sheet showed us that reservations after us were already seated.  We were offered a beer for our troubles but was relegated to standing in their corridor since we were not allowed to drink outside.  \n\nAfter finally getting seated, they took our orders but forgot about my beer, which the waitress quickly denied that I ordered it with her.   She did apologize after looking at our order again.  One of the appetizers was brought out with a piece of the codfish fritters falling on the table.  The person delivering the food just simply said, \""Oh, sorry.\"" and left.  Our fork and knives were taken away after eating our foie gras poutine (will get to that later) and then bread was delivered with only a huge spoon to spread the butter?\n\nThe Food:  The food was okay.  It was a little too fatty and greasy despite knowing what the menu was full of.  The foie gras poutine was delicious.  Nice portions of foie gras coupled with a thick, hearty, flavorful gravy.  I ordered the foie gras hamburger.  The foie gras was larger than the patty!  You can interpret that as you like.  Tried a piece of the pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras and it just tasted greasy with no substantial meat at all.  The duck in a can was okay, but tasted like steamed duck.\n\nI would not waste my time or money here.  A pretty horrible experience for a restaurant that's supposed to be \""hottest\"" restaurant in Montreal.  The only saving grace was the poutine."
1,"I really wanted to like this place because I saw a photo of their veggie sandwich in the Phoenix New Times Food Porn.  My husband and I went here after Ikea and wasn't that impressed. \n\nAmbiance was fun and the delivery of the food with the clipboards and bags are cool. \n\nService was fine and had no issues here. \n\nFood is the reason why I gave it a 2. The veggie had all of the ingredients for a good sandwich -  cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, sprouts, avocado, carrots and 2 cheeses which I chose Havarti and Provolone. However, with all of that, the veggies weren't that fresh and it was bland. My husband had their italian sandwich and enjoyed their banana peppers on it, but said that was bland too. \n\nWe like a little more kick or flavor to our sandwiches. I won't be visiting this place again."
2,"Made a random stop here after visiting the Food For Less in the same lot.  Noticed the drive through line was really long, and their little parking lot was pretty full, so I figured something had to be good about it.\n\nThe drive through has no menu, only until you get up to the window do you see a menu sort of written on the window.  We ordered mac & cheese, corn bread, and a pulled pork sandwich and 2 sides of fries.  They told us to pull to the side and they would bring it out.  We waited about 20 minutes, which sucked because I was starving, but they were very polite.\n\nThey failed to give me my corn bread :-( Even though the guy repeated our order as he handed it to us.  But oh well.  The mac & cheese was amazing.  I was very pleased with it.  My boyfriend also enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, and I had a bite and thought it was pretty good too.  Overall a nice little BBQ joint if you want food that tastes like it was made from home and at a really decent price.  Only $11 bucks for everything.  Would recommend (if you happen to be on this side of town)"
1,"I have been to this location a handful of times.  I am trying to avoid Pima as much as possible since they started construction.  I don't mind paying a little more for special items once in a while, but you expect better service with that.  I was waiting at the \""Boulangerie\"" to get my ice tea, I was there for a good 5 minutes making eye contact with the woman packing some pastries.  No acknowledgment, no greeting, no \""I'll be with you in a minute\"".  I was about to leave when someone else came to take care of me.  I guess I will keep avoiding this stretch of Pima"
2,"Also ich muss leider auch zwei Sterne abziehen. Nachdem ich jetzt ein paar mal da war, muss ich feststellen, dass der Service doch stark nachgelassen hat. Vielleicht w\u00fcrde es Sinn machen, wenn sich das Serviceteam mal kritisch mit den Kritiken auseinandersetzt und damit arbeitet. \nZum einen ist es mir v\u00f6llig unverst\u00e4ndlich, wie man an einem Sonntag die Getr\u00e4nketheke mit lediglich einer Person f\u00fcr Zubereitung und Service besetzen kann. Ich habe geschlagene 16 Minuten anstehen m\u00fcssen. So etwas ist ein NoGo. Die Pastak\u00f6che hatten in dieser Zeit \u00fcbrigens Langeweile, da muss sich dann halt mal einer einen anderen Kittel anziehen und flexibel sein. \nZum anderen muss den Kunden das System offensiver erkl\u00e4rt werden. Wenn das der Service am Eingang nicht immer schafft, hilft auch ein Schild mit ein paar Piktogrammen. \nWeiter geht mir das Pl\u00e4tze reservieren der meisten Kunden wirklich komplett auf den Senkel. Vapianos in anderen St\u00e4dten haben schon gelernt damit umzugehen und ich w\u00fcrde mir hier eine steilere Lernkurve w\u00fcnschen. Da kommt man sich schon vor wie im 3Sterne Club auf den Balearen, wenn zuerst einmal die Tische reserviert werden und dann das essen geholt wird. Damit sind die Tische dann grunds\u00e4tzlich ca. 15min l\u00e4nger besetzt, als wenn die G\u00e4ste sich einen freien Tisch suchen, wenn das Essen fertig ist. Der Service ist dann auch komplett \u00fcberfordert, wenn es Krach zwischen den G\u00e4sten gibt, der auf Grund der fehlenden Regeln leicht eskaliert. Wo soll man sich auch hinsetzen, wenn \u00fcberall Handt\u00fccher \u00e4hh Jacken liegen. Systemgastronomie beinhaltet das Wort \""System\"" - sollte man mal dr\u00fcber nachdenken. \n\nMein Fazit daher: Was andere Vapianos schon gelernt haben, muss sich in Karlsruhe noch einschleifen. \nMein Tipp: Mal ab und zu einen anderen Vapiano besuchen und lernen."
4,"Absolutely the best food, service and presentation I have ever experienced!   I live on the East Coast, travel weekly and experienced many restaurants across this country.  The Mission tops them all in every way.   Hope to return to Phoenix very soon."
2,"Lemongrass is a nice, classy restaurant with pretty good food.  Not spectacular or incredibly creative, but satisfying.  We ate the spring rolls and pad thai, and both were just fine.  We also ate the mushroom basil steamed rice, and the flavor combination of tender mushrooms, red peppers, and basil was really nice.\n\nThe service was a bit slow, but our server was really nice and friendly.  Lemongrass is a nice restaurant and the food is good, but I wouldn't add this to any must-dine restaurant lists."
3,"My friend and I went here for dinner while we were staying at the Venetian. My thoughts:\n\n- The place is really small - probably 6-7 tables inside the restaurant and another 7 or so in the mall just outside the restaurant (still indoors). But I liked the feel, it's a cute place.\n\n- Our waiter was great. I asked for a wine suggestion and he gave it to me. It was a house wine, nothing amazing, but I did like it better than the cab that my friend got, which was my alternative, so that marks it as a positive. He also joked with us, was very nice and courteous, just all-around good service.\n\n- The food was very good. Granted, I was really hungry, so part of the satisfaction was certainly just getting food in my stomach. My friend got the chicken francese and I got the baked ziti. We semi-shared (I gave her a 1/4 of mine and she gave me a 1/4 of hers). I enjoyed both dishes, although maybe the baked ziti a bit more than the chicken.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place. Definitely convenient if you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo."
3,"I don't get some of these poor reviews.  The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.  I've had worse Chinese food (including in China), but seldom better.  Just wish I lived closer, but I can always make an excuse to travel to a place I like as much as GHHK."

4,Been with AAA for almost two decades and I'm very satisfied with them! Jennifer our agent is awesome! She makes sure that we're taken care of! Thanks
3,guys this is one of the few places that pays attention to their customers and listens to what they write on here. they are definitely stepping their game up adding more great food to their menu and also expanding their selection of fine top shelf liquors. this place is becoming more of a place that i want to have a casual drink at even if they don't have a football game or a ppv fight and thats what i thought  was lacking before. keep up the great work clay!
4,"In the year and a half I've been going to nails by males, I have had all of the guys do my nails. They all do an amazing job! They've recreated every Pinterest picture and helped me come up with ideas when I had no clue what I wanted. You definitely need an apt but it's so worth it!"
2,"VERY SMOKEY!!!  So be sure to take your Benadryl. I've never gambled here but have eaten at their buffet several times. Ill review it separately. There does seem to be more local traffic here than on the strip.  They have lots of parking and lots of entrances so if you are doing what we did, the buffet, I'd go to the side entrance as it is right by that."
0,"Two caveats: 1, it is amazing and baffling that the near east side has no real mexican food, and 2, I get that people like margaritas, and that a kid-friendly restaurant (where the parents can drink said margaritas) is bound to have a built-in clientele.\n\nThat said, how the hell does this place stay in business?  \nI ate dinner there about a month ago, and the generally shabby quality of the food amazed me. The taco meats were dry and saturated with sugar (something I've noticed at other FF restaurants too), the tortillas were verging on stale, and the salsa bar, while always a good sign, contained exactly one edible salsa. \n\nTrying to stuff some calories in the ol' pie hole and get back to work, I doused my tacos in green Tabasco from the bottle on the table. \nProblem? It was horribly rancid, and the waiter I informed of this apparently didn't know that hot sauce can go rancid. I literally threw 3/4 of my meal in the trash can. \n\nMaybe they should spend less on their kitschy decor and more on the food. If you want Americanized Tex-Mex, go to Pasquals or Burrito D. If you want actual Mexican food, go to the south side."
0,"Dang. I thought I found a good mechanic.. I thought wrong. They're nice, but I don't want nice, I want the job done and done right.\n\nI came in because the GF's Benzo's engine was shaking. He immediately recommended motor mounts. So the tech checked it out and confirmed it, within 5 minutes. I was thinking, \""What the?.. You know just like that.\"" Brought me out and showed me.. I couldn't see a visible tear, collapsed mount, anything leaking from it, nothing. Combine that with the fact that the problem would only happen at startup, and went away after warm, I didn't believe it. He gave me a quote of about $600. \n\nI told em you better check that ish out again. So we went off to fashion show mall and came back and they're still recommending the same thing. We left.\n\nAnyway, with help of BenzWorld forums, I decided to take out the MAF and clean it. Driven for over 500 miles with no issues and can confirm that this was the problem. This fix cost about $5.\n\nBack to German Motors, so hypothetically, we would have blown through $600, problem would have still occurred. And IF he recommended MAF next (which he never mentioned), then that would have been about $400 for the part alone. The job takes 5 minutes to install, but c'mon, lets be honest, ain't no such thing as a 5 minute job in mechanic land. So prob another $100 for labor. Do you think he cleans it for $5 or charges us $500? \n\nSo saved at least $1,000 and I guess it just goes to show, if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. If anyone finds a decent BMW/Benz mechanic, let me know."
0,"What a disappointment. It's not the first time I order from here but it will be the last. I don't know if they changed the owner or chef but the pizza was such a let down. The first time I tried their pizza, their tomato was amazing. There was a certain spice that they used that left you craving another piece. This time was completely different. There was barely any sauce on the pizza and the dough seemed to have been raw. It was chewy and sat on your stomach. It's a huge disappointment especially when you were craving their pizza and finally cave and have one bite and throw it away. A waste of calories."
1,"Problem, Crowded, Solution, Don't go here. There is no room to move around. Their selection sucked when we went, they had a desk that looked like Edward Scissorhand used it. Their staff also must be trained to NEVER smile. I know its a 2nd Hand Store, but come on, have some customer service."
0,"This place needs to be closed down! Why all the hype? Mostly because it 'looks and feels' \""trendy\"". At best, it's mold ridden, and a good excuse not to clean the place, and then you add to this the fact that it is dusty. All this aside, the staff is either completely rude, or simply cannot be bothered. After arriving, it took 20 minutes to notice me, even though I was standing at the counter. Their online menu is NOT updated, so when I asked for a smoked salmon sandwich, the response (no joke) was, \""we don't carry salmon and fish items, because of the nuclear disaster meltdown in Japan\"". So wait, salmon only comes from Japan? I thought Canada had salmon too, no? The other patrons seemed puzzled by the response, but since they'd been waiting for a while, took their seats, when offered (hope they had a better time). Another 10 minutes elapsed before the gentleman decided to take my order. Of course, after this 30 minute investment, it was another 30 minutes for my takeout order to be ready. Such a serious waste of time! Their staff also have no concept of balance, when it comes to food, either too bland or just too much bland, or just too sweet (compare the sweetened iced tea to the apple juice). Super dry bread! Seriously, run if you can, or if your friends insist on going here, tell them that you'll meet them after having a decent meal elsewhere, but be under no illusions if you want terrible service, at a hefty price, with absolutely horrible food!"
0,First off we love Dennys and this was our 4th visit to this one we have gotten bad food here before but cooks do have bad days but 4 times..The eggs were under cooked and pancakes tasted old and dry and the rest of the plate had a puddle of grease\nI think the only thing good was the toast and coffee..All the other Dennys we get good food and good service so I think its time to get new cooks and new servers cause you keep this up and the dennys name wont save this place
0,"I know, I know, nobody really sleeps when they're in Vegas, so the hotel room shouldn't matter much... well, I do sleep, I like to take naps! My friends and I booked a room here two summers ago because we did not have much money and we wanted to be centrally located on the strip. While staying at Imperial Palace, we tried our best not to spend as much time in our room because it just felt really dirty, with a stained-blue carpet, thin (not 100% cotton) bedsheets and the base of the beds are attached to the floor -- a FLOORBED!  If you do end up staying here, try not to touch anything. Let's hope they will renovate soon, but before then, I will NEVER stay here again!"
4,"Vegan frozen yogurt. need i say more?! It's fracking delicious, dont even question the \""vegan\"" aspect of it. go go go!"
4,The food is amazing. Definitely the best Mediterranean restaurant in town. I ordered hummus and falafel...they were both outstanding. Try their mint tea (fresh mint leaves)....it is delicious.
4,"What a great place! The bar area was beautiful and seemed very inviting, however, since we were having lunch we sat at a table. Our waitress, April, was very attentive and kept our drink glasses topped off...always a plus. \nWe started with fried pickles which were lightly battered with a cornmeal batter. Served with a spicy Ranch dressing- great appetizer!\nWe all ordered something different and all decided we would try each other's meal when we returned. \nIf you're not sure what to order, go with the incredible steak salad with house bleu cheese!!!! It was a HUGE salad but I couldn't stop eating until I finished off every piece of steak! Always love fresh ingredients!\nI will definitely be back when I return to the area!"
4,"F\u00fcr jemanden wie mich, der permanent nah am Wasser gebaut hat, ein wahrer Alptraum ;) Auf der Fremont Street muss ich st\u00e4ndig v\u00f6llig and\u00e4chtig und ergriffen heulen.\nDas liegt zum einen am Charme des alten Las Vegas, an den zum Strip vergleichsweise moderaten Preisen, an der gigantischen LED-Decke, an der Zip-Line, an der man sich unter eben dieser abseilen kann, an den B\u00fchnen mit Live-Musik... besonders gerne wird hier Classic Rock aus den 80ern gespielt und Rockfans kommen bei all den guten Bands voll auf ihre Kosten. \nAuf besagter LED-Decke werden st\u00fcndlich Konzertausschnitte von Queen, Bon Jovi, den Beatles etc. gespielt, dazu fahren die namhaften Casinos, wie das Binion's, das Golden Nugget, Four Queens etc. ihre Beleuchtung auf \""zero\"", so dass man die Show in vollen Z\u00fcgen genie\u00dfen kann.\nauch aktuelles Tagesgeschehen wird schon mal an der Decke in Szene gesetzt. So konnten wir 2012 miterleben, wie am Todestag von Neil Armstrong alle Besucher der Fremont Street feierlich ihrem Helden gedachten. Wenn dann durch die lange Stra\u00dfe hallt \""\""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind\"" und alle das Wasser in den Augen stehen haben, dann m\u00f6chte man mitweinen.\nInsgesamt ist die Fremont Street chilliger als der Strip. Ein Besuch an Halloween lohnt sich, hier trifft sich die freakige Gemeinde, man wei\u00df gar nicht, wo man zuerst hinsehen soll.\n\nPS: unbedingt den Pool im Golden Nugget besuchen!!!"
1,"I rarely write reviews but felt it necessary this time. As a general rule, I would rather have okay food with great service as opposed to great food with mediocre service. Unfortunately both the food and the service was sub par. The food was quite bland and the service simply wasn't there. \n\nOur server made us feel like we were more of a burden rather than a guest. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect to have my nose wiped for me. But how about a smile, a \""how are you\"", some recommendations, specials, or anything? Don't ask us to pass our plates down to you because your not in the mood to bus the table.\n\nThere's far too many places to choose from that we'd like to support.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't one that we feel the need to give a second chance."
0,"Bought 3 Deal Chicken coupons in the hope that I would like this nail salon. The first service was ok, and I made another appointment. Got a text message last week that the salon is no longer in business, and now I am trying to get my money back from Deal Chicken."
0,"I guess it depends on which Walmart you go to on how good the service is.  In actuality, with as low as their prices are, I am surprised they can afford to pay checkstand employees at all.  That is why I use the self-checkout..."
3,"When Mom picked me up from the airport around 8 the pickins were a little slim. However, Mom knew of this good little wine bar that she thought I might like. Might like? Me? Wine? Bar? Needless to say, I LOVED it! And I was surprised that my mom had found such a cool place - sorry Mom :x. \n\nTheir selection of wines was good and their food selections ... we couldn't decide! We did tapas - beer battered calamari (it was okay ... some were a little chewy), fondue (OMG!! Let's just say that if I were to find a Cheese and Wine Bar I might start crying), and their tapas special - crab filled portabelo (really, really good!!). \n\nUnfortunately, I don't remember what wine I chose but it was good - apparently not memorable. \n\nI liked the live jazzy music but would have enjoyed my time here a little more if it wasn't so loud - and we were in the back. But the guy singing was good and that's what they do - jazz and wine - so I can't really complain. \n\nI'll be dragging mom back here next time I'm in town!"
2,"Had breakfast and part of a dinner here June 2013.\n\nGot a personalized omelet but I feel it was over cooked. The scrambled eggs are powdered. The bacon was good!  Biscuits were hard and inedible.  The hashbrowns were burnt. \n\nFor the dinner portion we had the salad bar which was very good, excellent ranch dressing.  My son tried the ribs and steak and loved it. \n\nWide selection of desserts.   Staff was really nice and that's what made it good to go here."
2,"It was ok.  We all got the tonkotsu shoyu, I guess we all though that was the most flavorful combination.  Well it wasn't.  I think miso usually is the strongest flavor unless you have some serious broth.  But their broth is a bit lighter.  Combined with Shoyu it was just saltly I guess.  Not very complex flavors.  The gyo za is average.  Doubt they make it themselves.  Probably try the miso instead of the tonkotsu shoyu if I ever come again.  Not a bad place, especially considering vegas, but overall not the best."
3,"I'm traveling for some corporate training this week, so I had to have my business suit and a dress dry cleaned.  I have to say that they did a good job and were pretty prompt.  I've been very satisfied with this place in all the years I've been coming here."
3,"Stayed here for 4 nights this past weekend for our 40th anniversary.  Had a fabulous time.  The place is south of the main strip, but on the same street. If you want to go to a very nice casino, with upscale rooms, service, and very friendly staff, this is the place.  Suzy at the front desk is the best.  If you go, ask for Suzy when you check in, she is GREAT.\nNow for the constructive part.  They really don't have a \""breakfast\"" place.  The serve a limited breakfast in the \""Burgers and Beer\"" restaurant, and they have an amazing bakery place called \""Baby Cakes\"".  The goodies there are very good, and the donuts and Danishes are outstanding, but not a \""normal kinda\"" breakfast.  That said we made due in Baby Cakes, and except for the calories ( lots of them here) part we loved it.\nOverall it's a great place to stay and try your luck.  The staff is friendly, and always willing to help, they have a comfortable atmosphere, and the casino area is not so crowded as to make you want to leave."
1,"How utterly disappointing this place was! I was responsible for deciding where to eat since I'm on yelp all the time. I decided to lead my group here since this place got decent reviews and it was in our hotel. \n\nAtmosphere was good. Very dark place and it was pretty empty on a Sunday night. Ambiance is nice for a date since it seems like a intimate and casual location. \n\nService was friendly and there was no complaints there. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. \n\nFood was...well, how can I say this nicely...overpriced and overall disappointing. The food I ordered wasn't BAD, but definitely wasn't worth the price we paid. I ordered the sampler that came with the buffalo chicken lollipops, walnut shrimp, and philly cheesesteak dumplings. All three tasted great, but cost $30 total. RIDICULOUS!!!!! Portions were tiny. Granted the shrimp were more like jumbo prawns, but that does NOT warrant the price I paid. Yes...I understand location and rent and blah blah blah..but that's just ridiculous for such simple food. My friends ordered entrees that were priced pretty high as well and they were unimpressed with the steak and pasta dishes. I also ordered the Doritos Mac and Cheese and felt that it did not have a good cheese consistency. I've had better...way better. \n\nI was expecting some thrilling food experience, but left with emptier pockets and sad faces. I failed my friends on this yelp-based food adventure."
1,"We've been with Clear since moving to NLV in January 2011. Service has been just okay until Thanksgiving 2013 when it went downhill so fast it wasn't funny. Contacted them and was told the tower is congested due to high usage. WTF? Not my problem. My problem is I pay $50 per month for service and it isn't happening. I paid less than $30 per month where I used to live and the service was much, much better. These ISPs in Vegas are making a killing for less than stellar service. Time for an upstart to usurp them."
3,"Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding."
1,"Don't sit next to the fountain unless you want to yell your entire meal. This ruined most of our night, but the food wasn't bad. Large portions though. Right in the middle of the Casar Forum."
4,"On an excursion through middle eastern countries searching for a slightly used puzzlebox I was told of a small shop in none other than Tempe. I went looking for the gateway to a land of extreme pains and pleasures, instead I found pretty grand shisha prices. I have decided that between the excellent service and prices that I wont be looking for shisha elsewhere. Still looking for a puzzlebox and a girl with wires in her face and a leather fetish."
0,"Do NOT rent from these low life's  I leased a home from them in Summerlin for two years. Treated that home like my own. Paid our rent by the 28 th of the month. Had air condition issues and during the hot seasons May thru October because one of the units had a slow leak it cost is about 200 per month in extra electric bills because they would not replace one of the units as recommended by their air conditioner service. Because I complained about that and the carpet which was about 9 to 10 years old which was a cream color needed to be replaced they sent me a certified letter giving me 35 days to vacate . We threatend them with court action and they backed off. In Nevada that is considered retrubtution which under Nevada law that is 1,000.00 in damages. Also out of a 2,200.00 deposit they had the gall to refund us 638.00 charging us the cost of replacing the carpet. I have brought a suit in small claims court and obtained a default judgement for almost 6,000.00. Anyone who rents from this company did not let them get away whith this if they try it with you. Take them to court. You do not need an Attorney to do this you can do it yourself. It is not difficult. Any security they keep is theirs not the owners and when you challenge them they blame it own the owners of the property.\n\nNeil R"
4,"Let me preface this review by saying that the very first sushi experience I had was at a little restaurant named Sushi Hama in Tucson years and years ago. I LOVE sushi and the first time I had it I was instantly hooked (they have this specialty roll- the \""Pancho roll\""- named after the owner). They've since opened several locations and are under new management. Whenever I go back to Tucson I make it a point to stop by this place. (P.S. If anyone reading this makes a pit stop in Tucson- check this place out [or at least the Yelp page]).\n\nSo, the other day my bf and I had a craving for sushi and wanting to try a new place we stopped in here. As I'm looking through the menu I see a \""Pancho roll\"" and a \""Tucson roll\"" on the menu. I immediately light up and ask the sushi chef behind the bar if a Pancho works here. Sure enough the former owner of Sushi Hama is now here! I don't know if he owns this place or not but he still makes THE best sushi! The Pancho roll was just as good as I had remembered it being and the experience brought me back to the first time I'd had that roll many moons ago. We ended up getting the all you can eat which comes with the familiar salad w/ sesame oil salad dressing, miso soup and edamame. Every roll we had was delicious and Pancho even made a special extra spicy tuna roll for my bf.\n\nI am so happy to have accidentally stumbled upon this place and I tell you- I will definitely be hitting this place up when I need my sushi fix!"
3,"Indian food is almost always expensive, so I won't even bother to complain about that.  But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.  \n\nThe SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).\n\nCHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.  \n\nAll entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.\n\nThe ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.  \n\nThe traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.  \n\nThe service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.  \n\nFor people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet)."
3,"This is definitely one of my favorite places downtown.  \nWe love live music!  In fact, musicians play on a stage above the main bar and behind the beer taps.  Sweet set up.  There is no set dance floor so expect myself and others to be dancing around your table.  Some nights there are some really great bands playing and others have the bands that play the Vegas style top 40 mash ups that I find a little strange.\nThe staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink.  I can always count on Willis to serve my vodkas up right.  Not too stiff, not too weak.  A great bartender that always adds to our fun time.\nThe location is fantastic.  The sister to Stand Up live, across from Lucky Strike, on the second floor of CityScape, so the view on the patio of downtown at night is a winner.\nI haven't ate here yet, but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live, it's pretty tasty bar fair.\nIt's a great choice if you're looking for a fun time downtown.  (You don't need to be a hipster to fit in either)"
0,"Went to Bicycle Ranch some years back for a bike fit with Paric (not sure how to spell his name). Never did get fit. He took several measurements, but was never really paying attention as he was busy talking with my wife the entire time. In the end, he moved my cleats back a few millimeters and told me that I need physical therapy to loosen my hips. He did nothing to address my issues with discomfort on the bike. So much for getting what you pay for. Pick another shop if you expect to have a professional fit. I won't even step into that bike shop anymore."
3,"I am a huge Greek/Mediterranean food lover so I had high expectations for this place after going to Market Grille Cafe for so long.\n\nWalking in, I noticed immediately that the seating area was much bigger than I anticipated. Whether or not they get that busy I'm not sure, as I went around 2pm and there were only two other gentlemen eating there. Of course they play your traditional Mediterranean music which pairs well with the decor.\n\nI placed an order ahead of time and initially planned on taking it back to work but decided to eat there instead. The man running the customer facing counter was pretty friendly and welcoming. To the left of the register I noticed a tall wall sectioned into different \""levels\"" of beers; all assorted based on quality and price. I saw they had Innus and Gunn which had me perk up instantly since you'll typically find this at a liquor store only. I ordered one along with my meal but ended up disappointed as they had it displayed on the wrong shelf, expecting it to be $3.50 when in reality cost close to $5.00. When I asked about the price he replied, \""Oops, someone must have put it on the wrong shelf. Do you still want it?\"" I was hoping he would have made some sort of effort to adjust the price this one time but no such luck. I went with a Blue Moon instead. This was my only negative experience since I work retail and whenever I encounter this issue I try to take care of the customer within reason.\n\nI ordered a lamb Gyro wrap. When I called in and asked about the portion compared to a full Gyro, they said it's smaller compared to a typical Gyro but can still fill you. They were right about one thing, it definitely was filling. If this was \""small\"" compared to their typical Gyro then you had better bring an appetite for a Gyro. This wrap was definitely a good size and the price was definitely generous for the amount. The meat was very tender and the hummus tasted very \""authentic\"", unlike some cheap hummus you'd buy from a store. They also throw some pita bread and hummus as a side at no charge and free baklava, which was also very good, if you check in on Yelp.\n\nI only give 5 stars to places that absolutely blow my mind. My experience was very desirable here and earned a solid 4 stars and to be honest if this were closer to home, for the price, portions and quality I'd definitely eat here over Market Grille Cafe. If you like Greek food you won't be disappointed."
1,"It seems like at some point the idea behind outlet shopping has changed.  It used to be a way that manufacturers could sell direct to the public stuff that retailers didn't want (slightly damaged, out of date seasons) at cheap cheap prices.\n\nIt seems lately like it's simply a place where these manufacturers can cut out the retailer's margins and sell direct to the public.  The prices really aren't weren't that good on my last visit (is it just me that noticed this?).  Maybe it was just because we were shopping the weekend after 4th of July weekend, but I found it was hard to find anything beyond 10 to 20% off in most stores.\n\nWe went to the non-outlet fashion show mall (ON THE STRIP) and were able to find many of the same products we were looking for for cheaper. \n\nIf you take away the cheap prices then I'm just walking around in 110+ degree weather, and if that's the case i would prefer to be browsing around in a nice comfy air conditioned mall :).\n\nHelpful tip: If you're looking at getting to the mall from the strip for cheap, take the ACE bus.  It doesn't stop at every single hotel like the deuce and is way cheaper than taking a taxi."
3,"This is a great place to bring the kids or hold a birthday party. We've had 2 of my son's parties at Peter Piper and everyone has a blast. The pizza is really good too, I have to admit. My favorite is the veggie with jalapenos. What I like most about this PP is that it's always clean. I've been to other pizza/party places that smell bad when you walk in. Never the case here."
2,Discount tire tries go out of there way to help you. Don't forget it is a tire company so this is quite nice. Nobody likes to buy new tires these days with the prices through the roof but atleast they're trying to make it pleasant.
4,"Very professional cleaning, and very nice people. My wife and I have used their services for years, and I highly recommend to all."
4,"I LOVE POTTERROW!! It is one of several of Edinburgh University's student unions and it is by far my favourite. It is a great place to sit and do some work during the day or to have lunch with friends in. It has a shop selling sandwiches, snacks, drinks etc as well as magazines and stationary. It also sells Edinburgh University goods such as hoodies and folders. The best aspect of this store for me is the sushi - it sells the most amazing sushi which is very reasonably priced - \u00a32.99 for six maki rolls. The shop is always busy at lunch time and the staff are very friendly. \n\nPotterrow occasionally holds gigs at night for small bands to come and play, but the union really comes alive on a Saturday night for the Big Cheese, one of my favourite places to go for a night out in Edinburgh.  It used to be free entry, but it is now only free until 10pm and then it is \u00a33 to get in.  The music is cheesy pop from the '70s to '90s mixed with current chart music.  The drinks are very cheap, but the one downside to the Big Cheese is the massive queue to get in which seems to move so slowly.  They do take their time in letting the students into the union, but once you are in it is definitely worth it!"
4,One of my all time favorite places.  The Lasagana is awesome!
0,"HMMMM......still no option for zero stars??? well I wish i could give a better review, but it's hard to when you NEVER get greeted!!! LOL So i'll try.....this was the first time i've ever gotten up and walked out of a restaurant. My wife wanted to stay and complain, but we were both pretty hungry already and didnt really want to wait around to talk to some 'Joe Shmoe' Manager, who obviously doesn't give a crap about service and hospitality.\n\nWe walked in at about 8:15-8:20pm lastnight, no hostess, nobody there to greet us. Stood there for about 4-5min, finally a girl walks by and asks, \""oh do you need a table?\""\n\nSo at this point, a little annoyed, but oh well they must have cut the hostess early that night? Start looking at the menu, a couple minutes go by, still no server. We see a couple different servers walk by our table and glance at us but just ignored us. So i guess those servers were all cut? or it wasnt their turn? \n\nWe both knew that they didnt have the full staff of servers on still, but you'd think somebody would eventually greet us.\n\nSo we finish looking at the menu, sat there for another couple minutes. Saw another 2 different servers walk by us and talk to the two booths on both sides of us to ask how things were, and both walked away without talking to us.\n\nI could understand maybe miscommunication, or if we had beverage napkins down already, or if we had walked over from the bar and already had drinks, maybe everyone who walked by us just assumed we had already been helped....\nbut NO!! nothing! we had nothing infront of us, other than 2 folded up menus that we both had read over almost 4 times!! LOL\n\nThen there was one busser that walked by and kind of glanced at us after we had been there for 5 mintues and he could tell something was up. But still nothing.\n\nThen i turned to my wife and said, \""ok lets just go, this is garbage.\"" we were both kind of hesitant about walking about, because we had never done it, but this was a joke! she asked are you sure? should we say something? i said, \""to who? nobody is stopping at our table to greet us, just get up, follow me, lets go.\""\n\nSo as we were sliding out of the booth, we left the menus on the table, nobody tried to stop us or ask us what was wrong, obviously nobody cared. Headed to the exit, right past the host stand. Noticed there were 3 girl servers just hanging out kind of off to the side of the host stand, but still in front for everyone to see. Just chatting with themselves, all of them messing with their phones, one girl had her purse on so she must have been leaving soon. All 3 girls were oblivious and watched us walk out.\n\nNow i've been going to Macayo's since i was 12, back when there was only one location over in mesa, then the one in downtown tempe, and been coming to this location since it opened back when i was in high school. Now the tempe location is great, still go there, the patio is cool, never had a problem there. \n\nBut here, this garbage ahwatukee location, yea its gotten to that point now, garbage. It started off good when it first opened about 10 years ago. But over the years this location has reeeeaaallly dropped off. Not so much the food, dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good, but the service over the years! BLEH!!! just like the 17 different times they've re-painted the outside of the restaurant!!!  LOL\n I know management and staffs change over the years, but you can really tell that they dont care anymore.\n\nSo anyone in the ahwatukee area if you're in the mood for mexican food dont even consider Macayo's on 48th & Warner. You'd be better off going to the Taco Bell right there for better service. Or just down 48th street to chandler for Arriba's(which is where we ended uo going)."
1,Went there for NYE at the early set for Candy Foster.  He was the best part of the visit.  Ashley our server was good.  I ordered the scallops and could not eat them as they were raw and only barely grilled.  The sprouts had been warm at onetime but were also cold.  My friend ordered the duck and it was good.  It was a very expensive meal for something I could not eat.  Next time a salad for me.  I only went for the music and I guess that's what I got:(
3,"I'm glad they were at the Yelp Helps, because I don't think I'll ever get a chance to get to their place. The pumpkin was my favorite, the  chocolate salted caramel..... nah! there has to be something missing to this one, but the blend of flavors just didn't work for a cupcake. This flavor is wonderful on just chocolate.\n\nThank you for spoiling us at the Yelp event!"
4,"I'm a huge fan of Chef Shawn McClain, so being able to visit his restaurant within the same hotel that we were staying in was a bonus.  \n\nHere's the rundown of our choices:\n\nWagyu Beef tartar....  Melt in your mouth, stomp your feet, kick your partner under the table good!\n\nThe Beet Salad:  roasted red and yellow beets in some sort of slightly acidic vinaigrette with a crisp piece of prosciutto.  One word:  FIERCE\n\nI don't remember what my partner had because I had dived into my dinner and barely remember anything other then really wanting to place my face in the stainless steel bowl and shamelessly lick it clean.  BUT, I had the veal cheeks with the most creamy polenta base and a braised leek with some unknown mushroom variety.  With each bite, I melted and slid lower into my seat.  I don't eat mushrooms.... I've hated them since I was a kid....  but I ate those.  That's right mom....  I ate mushrooms!  \n\nA chef's fundamental mantra is for the dish to be a feast for the senses...  Not only was the dish a feast for the senses but so was the location itself....  Everything came together to make it THE most amazing dining experience I've ever had.  \n\nTHANK YOU!  (By the way, as I was writing this review my mouth started watering as I recalled the experience)"
1,"Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.\n\nFelt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast."
0,Food sucks for vegetarians (and its overpriced) but the atmosphere was fun. Probably wouldnt go back though....they need more veggie options!!
0,"Table tops etc really upset me with there work. I showed them what I wanted with pictures and they said they can do that same exact thing but did not deliver. I showed them specific vases I wanted them to use and they did not use what I showed them on the day. I am really upset and I wish I knew better. After the whole situation a lot of people told me that they were not a good place to go to. I thought that because they had 5 stars it would be a good place.. It was probably just family reviewing them because all the reviews are in the same time frame. They charge you for the water and for the fridge use for the flowers.. They really over charge in general. I do not recommend this place to anyone. They use as little flowers as possible to save money in there pocket. If anyone wants to see for themselves I have the pictures of what I asked for and what she made.. It's a disgrace. My mom, aunt, and the bridal party were shocked."
0,"I bought a water heater from this company.  It did not heat the water.  When I called they sent another technician who told me \""it wasn't installed correctly\""\nA month later without my approval they charged my credit card $173.00 for the second visit to install it correctly.\nNicky said she would have the boss call me.  He did not.\nShe just charged my credit card without resolution, and without my authorization."
3,"Always a good time! Very Smokey inside! They need better ventilation! I've now been here on two different occasions, and it's just so much fun! The songs are classic, they play requests for a donation, and they get the crowd up and roaring! The twins were playing on Saturday night. They did a fabulous job!"
2,"Came here with a group of co-workers for lunch one day. Place was packed and we were lucky to find an empty table. I got half honey habanero and half citrus chipotle. Interesting flavors but both were a little on the sweet side. No matter - there are plenty more flavors to choose from. I figured we'd be back another time to try more flavors but one of our co-workers got shafted by this place big time. First off, they never called his order. When he finally flagged a server about it, she went to fix the problem but then he was given the wrong order - somebody else's order maybe but not what HE ordered. When they finally brought the correct order, the server served up such an attitude I had to wonder what he did/said to her when he ordered to deserve any of it. Who knows? He might have secretly goosed her when she was walking by or tried to harass her for her number while ordering at the counter. I'm just speculating and trying to figure out an explanation because it almost seems like he was singled out for such treatment and the server acted like she despised him in a way that was personal. The other woman at the counter who seemed to be running things was actually very pleasant about everything so who knows - maybe that particular server was just having a bad day. Whatever the case it ruined our chances for coming back because from now on if someone mentions ATL Wings as a lunch possibility for our group lunch gathering, there will definitely be a veto."
0,"We used to come here a lot. I like their taco salad and their sandwiches. One day my girlfriend got brave and tried a Philly cheese steak. She doesn't typically like cheese steak sandwiches. Her mom also got a cheese steak, but I went for a BBQ pork sandwich. Later that night they both got up and went to different bathrooms and threw up. My girlfriend was up every hour throwing up. We can only assume it was food poisoning. It was the only thing they both had eaten that was the same. They were sick for three days with it. Never eating here again."
1,"I'll keep this review short and sweet. Tried a few buffets here in vegas so far and this one is by far the worse. Food quality is MAYBE a step up from golden corral. Only thing is golden corral prices their slop better than this place. Just for reference, we had a buffet at the bellagio last night and it was the best buffet I have ever had and was only $5 more per person than this place. \n\nStaff is ok but nothing to brag about. They brought our sodas and we could tell right off the bat they were diet soda. I told the lady and she says people have been saying that all night??!! Then why not warn us first??\n\nWon't be back......ever"
2,"This review's not gonna be totally negative, but I've gotta hit the \""bad stuff\"" first, for those with short attention spans:\n\nONE HUNDRED DOLLAR NON-REFUNDABLE PET DEPOSIT!\n\nYou've been warned.\n\nI'm sure there are other hotels that charge pet deposits, but in my limited travels, this is the FIRST time I've been charged a pet deposit of any sort, UP-FRONT at that. Max, my big, lovable 90 lb Black Lab had just been groomed the week before, is constantly on heartworm/flea/tick/mosquito prevention, current on all shots. I was in town to see my friends' band open up for Kansas, at the Vegas Biker Fest. Rooms were at a premium this weekend; combine that with being just plain tired after the 350-mile drive from San Diego, & I resigned myself to bite the bullet, pay the deposit, & check in.\n\nI booked this room via Hotwire, who mysteriously handed me off to Hotels.com, so to be fair, booking was through a third (or would that be FOURTH?) party. HOWEVER, if Residence is gonna secure business via a third party, that doesn't excuse either party from FULL DISCLOSURE. If a pet deposit was mentioned at all, NOT mentioned very prominently. I'll admit to not checking back at the website, but it doesn't matter. If you've ever used an ATM away from your home bank's network, ATM provider is required to advise you of the transaction fee you'll incur, BEFORE you can proceed (you have to accept to continue). NO such mechanism in place for my transaction; there SHOULD be.\n\nI consider charging a non-refundable pet deposit, without proper advisement, to be DECEPTIVE. I had no idea I'd be charged until I was at the front desk, checking in.\n\nThen, my key wouldn't operate the entry gate; I couldn't drive in. At first, I thought they'd given me a defective card. After talking to a lady who'd been there since AUGUST, I realized everyone was having the same problem, the hotel had obviously been aware of this for a long time, & chose to do nothing. Small detail, right? Well, just be the head of a traffic jam, the center of attention, people thinking you don't know how to use your card, and it won't seem as small. \n\nBut at least the smartass behind me had to eat his words when his card wouldn't work either; the dude who was SURE I \""wasn't using enough authority\"" with my card. (Yeah buddy, I don't have strength to handle a  1/2-ounce key card; please show me how it's done...)\n\nI didn't expect the type of building I lodged in. Most Residence Inns I've seen are high-rises, with concrete slabs for each floor. This place was a group of 2-story, multi-unit buildings. I don't have a problem with that, but they were obviously wood-frame construction. Why does this matter? Well, if you have a downstairs room, you hear EVERY footstep of your upstairs neighbors, every time a faucet goes on, or toilet flushed. \n\nBefore I sound like I can't be pleased, let's get to the good points; there are several:\n\nResidence Inn's located in or near Downtown Las Vegas, depending on who you talk to . There's a monorail station right across the street; I wish I'd had time to make a round-trip on it, just to see the sights. This was my 1st trip to Vegas, even though I grew up in Cali; the only other monorail I've ever seen was at Disneyland. Monorail makes sense for Public Transportation, for several reasons.\n\nRoom has full kitchen; I mean FULL. Full-size fridge, w/ icemaker, m'wave, elec range w/ oven, sink, garbage disposal, & all the pots, pans, knives, utensils, silverware you need to cook. Knives were cheap (I had to buy a decent Chef's knife at Albertson's), but understandable; I'd do the same thing if I owned a hotel. Knives develop \""legs\"", just like towels!\n\nThey'll even do your shopping, for no add'l charge beyond cost of groceries (but PLEASE TIP).\n\n\""Free\"" WiFi, but if you want SECURE WiFi, $5 more. If I'd brought my laptop, I can use my phone as secure hotspot, so I don't need it myself.\n\nFree breakfast, tho layout of buffet area seemed sorts haphazard. And weird things; all the condiments you expect to make breakfast tacos...except...TORTILLAS. But everything was really good.\n\nBed was comfy, grounds very attractive. Staff, very attentive & friendly.\n\nAppropriately named, Residence Inn; you could LIVE here for an extended stay (oops, that would be a competitor). \n\nBut I gotta come back to that damn NON-REFUNDABLE PET DEPOSIT. \n\nDEAL BREAKER!\n\nI know if I'd invested 5 min of my time I could've easily found a place just as nice with no pet deposit. That said, with OR without Max in tow, if it's a Marriott or Marriott-branded hotel (Residence Inn, Springhill Suites, Courtyard, etc), I will avoid them unless I have no alternative. And there's ALWAYS an alternative. \n\nNOW, the \""pet deposit question\"" will be part of my standard routine, & if I book through a hotel app, I'll call the location DIRECTLY, assure there are no surprises when I get there.\n\nGet rid of that deposit, and yes, I WILL stay at a Marriott brand again. Until then, NO WAY JOS\u00c9!\n\n\nlarrythediner\n\n\n."
2,"For sure this is the LEAST EXPENSIVE Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to and I liked some things much better than other things here so it's very hard to give a correct rating and three stars is still a positive rating. \n\nBy far my favorite thing to recommend that I tried is the Bo Nuong La Nho is basically seasoned barbecued Ground Beef wrapped in grape leaves served with  rice paper, vegetables, and fish sauce. This was among my favorite Vietnamese appetizers I've ever had. and was truly good. You do need to roll the rice paper yourself with the stuffed grape leaf, herbs and vegetables and then dip in the fish sauce. I really liked this dish and would come back for that.\n\nI had the chicken pho and I did taste my husband's beef pho. After tasting them both I have to say the beef pho with brisket is the way to go here because the brisket was very good and the beef stock was better than the chicken stock but the rare beef in that pho turned to over cooked dry beef as the chicken breast also turned over cooked and dry in the chicken pho.\n\nWe did receive a generous amount of Thai basil, limes and jalapenos to use with all the sauces on the table.\n\nI am aware that chicken pho isn't prepared the way that beef pho is with the charred onions and ginger for flavor but the chicken pho that I tried was a generous portion of bland watery stock with dry chicken breast and really is the reason for the three star rating. \n\nService was good and efficient.\n\nIf you are in need of a restroom you need to use the Lee Lee's Market restroom and it was very unpleasant. \n\nYOU DON'T\""T WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW!"
4,"This is a loooong overdue yelp. (Sorry streets from a busy momma.)\n\nWe first ordered streets when we had a bogo coupon from valpack. What's there to lose? Well we didn't lose but gained an awesome Italian joint in our neighborhood!\nWe catered with them (pizza and wings) for my sons first birthday party and once again streets delivered! Our guests were raving about the food! My mother (born and raised in upstate NY) said \""tastes like home\""! They even let us rent the bags to keep the pizza warm, and return them after the party was over. How awesome is that!?\n\nGreat customer service! Awesome pizza! \nGive em a try! You wont be sorry!"
0,"What a horrible experience! Went to grab a peanut butter cup smoothie after a movie. The smoothie tasted like nothing but chocolate, banana and ice. There was no peanut butter flavor whatsoever! While scooping with a spoon, I discovered a large clump of peanut butter the size of a fist. I brought the smoothie back to the counter and asked them to re-blend it. The girl said that she would remake it for me. She still could not get the peanut butter to blend, then asked for assistance from the other employee, who decided that pouring tap water into my smoothie was a good idea to solve the problem. At that moment, I was done and asked for my money back."
4,"Love this place! Next time we're back in Madison, Marigold Kitchen will be on our must-stop list for brunch. We had two of the specials. The eggs were fluffy and creamy and cooked perfectly with pancetta, ricotta, herbs and Parmesan.  The granola pancakes were amazing with honey butter and berries. The menu is full of unique, delicious options - hard to decide!"
0,"After having multiple menus sent to our home, my wife and I thought we would give this place a shot.  It was the WORST choice we could've made!! The food was absolutely dreadful!!\n\nMy wife was craving a pastrami sandwich so I went to the restaurant and proceeded to order the pastrami with cheese, along with their Brother's sub and an order of garlic mozzarella bread.  We first tried the garlic bread and it was so bad that we ended up throwing most of it away....the cheese was cold and barely melted, and it was of poor quality and very cheap tasting.  The marinara sauce that accompanied the bread was flavorless.   The pastrami sandwich came with some fries but was bone dry and they did not give us any condiments like mustard or ketchup.  Honestly speaking, the footlong pastrami at Subway blows this sandwich away by a mile AND it's cheaper!!! \n\nI had the Brother's sub, which supposedly had chicken fingers, bacon, ranch, and something else.....but like the pastrami, it was dry as dry can be and very bland!! It was pretty skimpy for a sub and it was also overdone because parts of the sub roll were badly burnt!  The box that it came in was overfilled with fries as to give the impression that the sandwich had more weight to it....a trick easily spotted by savvy foodies!!! \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!! If I could give it negative stars, I would do so!  This place was much better when it was Bella Lynda because the younger guy who made the pizzas back then was awesome, but I'll never go back to this place!!!"
4,"Dr. Doubrava is my eye care specialist.  He is an excellent physician.  I have been here for several yearly exams, and I stop in more often than I should because I'm always doing something to break, damage, or otherwise inhibit the lifespan of my glasses.  This is usually a hiking induced problem.  The office has a registered optometrist, Melissa, and she is top notch.  She has come to my rescue on many occasions.\n\nIn short, Dr. Doubrava's office is a one stop place for my eye care.  I appreciate him and the staff and will continue to stop here."
0,"This place sucks.  We have been there 2 times, with an attempted 3rd time.  1st time, burnt pizza, was horrible.  2nd time, we were told that it would be a 15 minute wait, we waited 1 hour 15 minutes, then it took 1 hour and 20 minutes for them to bring us the wrong pizza.  Last time, we called and were told no wait, showed up 3 minutes later and found out there was an 1 and 1/2 hour wait.  They told us it was standard practice to tell any person that calls is there is no wait.  Won't go back.  Florencias, Nellos and Grimaldies all have better Pizza."
1,"We were in the area, very hungry and  both pretty excited there was a Sammy's  close by. I don't have many choices because of my gluten intolerance but Sammy's has GF options.  My husband and I ordered the exact same pizza's as we did at the N Durango location and they didn't taste anything like the ones we had there. \n\nThey both were under cooked, the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. It just didn't taste like it held the same standards as that location. I've only eaten at the N Durango location and that set the bar pretty high and this didn't even come close. \n\nIt wasn't even worth asking them to remake it, or put it back in the oven, because I don't believe they could have done any better than what they served us. Needless to say I walked out hungry and slightly grumpy that I wasted my money. \n\nIt has a casino/bar and restaurant you can sit and order at and I normally don't like to sit in the \""smoking\"" section but the hubby wanted to gamble and we were the only ones in there so I that's where we ate. Bartenders were nice and very personable.I ordered the cucumber cooler (i think)  and it was about as delicious as the food.\n\nI've raved about the Durango & 95 location. Now I know that each location could be different from the next, so keep that in mind.\n\nI would just be leery of this Sammy's. It's close to the strip and has that casino bar feel and It really does lack quality, but don't use this location to judge the rest."
0,People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order.
2,"I go to Studio 24 on a regular basis, mainly for their monthly nights. In particular, Green Door on the 2nd / 3rd (I can't remember) Saturday of each month: a retro 'disco' night, playing only tunes from the 50s and 60s for you to shake it up (baby), twist and shout.\n\nI love the night, but I always warn friends who are thinking of going that the club itself is a bit scaffy. It reminds me of those cringe-worthy school discos at 1st year in school. Dusty wooden floors, chairs and tables scattered round with a space made for the dance floor.\n\nBut at Green Door there's a papier mache crocodile (the Rock-adile) looking after the free cake (that's always delicious) and a barber giving gents a proper Danny-from-Grease flick hair style. The scaffyness kind of suits it.\n\nThe club itself is down a dodgy road, under a bridge, behind Waverley train station. Wouldn't recommend going down there alone.\n\nThe bouncers are always friendly. The staff on the door are nice. It's just very cheap, scaffy, a bit old. I'd go here for themed nights, but not much else."
2,"We really liked the hotel itself.  Its older but has had face lifts and the rooms and the lodge are really very nice.  A very unique location - out in the desert outside of Phoenix and the boulders and hills around are unlike anyplace you've ever seen.  A great outdoor environment.  Only issues we had were that dining options were extremely limited for a five star resort - a little quirky fancy dining room and the other options were a lot  more low end.  Nothing in between.  And the three pools - really only two of them were options for food and drink service, and they were small and very crowded.  Not a current era desert resort from that perspective.  So if you're a pool lizard this place isn't for you.  Service overall was extremely top notch.  We really really enjoyed our stay but the food and the pools really surprised us for a five star place.  Bring your ipad - Wifi is high quality and they have HDMI jacks on the walls so that you can do Netflix or whatever in the rooms on the HD TV's.  A very cool feature.  The spa was fantastic, one of the best treatments we've had in years, if a little pricey.  Call ahead and book a couples' massage or the Watsu treatment."
0,"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!"
3,Awesome hummus plates.... Especially the hummus with cilantro!!\n\nAwesome cauliflower app... I don't even like cauliflower but that app was amazing.\n\nMy wrap was just ok.
2,Rainbow chili's was not my favorite.  We came in after 9 pm for a drink after a long flight and we felt neglected.  I just wanted a drink and some of chili's awesome chips but the waitress took 15 minutes to greet us then told us the chip machine was broken down. It was 930 Wah wah wah...  Debbie downer!
2,"This place wasn't bad for a chain restaurant, never been to one of these, wouldn't go back, but it served its purpose in Vegas.  One of those places you go when you fly in and don't get into your hotel until after midnight and don't know your way around the Strip.  We stayed on the strip at Bally's and this place was in the Flamingo.  I'm not a Buffet fan,m so it didn't have my appeal but my lady said they had good margaritas and they did.  WE both had burgers and gotta say, pretty good.  This place was pretty loud and raucous, felt kinda like being at a frat party down south in Tennessee with a cover band cranking out today's biggest hits.  Our tab came to about 52 bucks for two burgers and two drinks total.  The service was surprisingly good for being as loud and crowed and crazy as it was."
4,"When we booked our last minute Vegas/Grand Canyon vacation, we did so on a bit of a budget and booked our first few nights at Circus Circus in order to take advantage of the free pair of Cirque du Soliel tickets.  One positive thing I can say about our stay at Circus Circus is that it certainly made our decision to splurge on the Bellagio for our last night feel like the best decision we ever made!\n\nThe lobby is absoulutely gorgeous!  Probably one of the nicest in Vegas.  Check-in was approximately 50 times faster here, and they had us in our room in no time!  We were greeted by a very friendly housekeeper who came in and made sure our towels, robes, pillows, and chocolates were fully stocked and showed us where everything was.  Very sweet and friendly lady!\n\nThe room was immaculate, the bathroom was amazing, the curtains opened and closed remotely, the bed was super comfy, and the view was unbeatable!  We felt like royalty in our room!\n\nHUGE disappointment of the night:\nWe had decided to pay a bit more for the full lakeview room, which offered a full view of the fountains of Bellagio, complete with the music streamed live through the TV.  We got ourselves a bottle of wine, settled ourselves in front of the window, and waited for the show to begin... and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, I called the front desk and inquired as to why the fountains were not going off.  I was informed that they had canceled the shows for the evening due to very high winds.  I wanted to cry.  We hadn't seen the fountains all week because we had been saving it to see on our last night from our room.  I asked if they were offering any kind of discount for their guests who had paid extra for the lakeview room, and I was transferred to an extremely sympathetic and apologetic woman who agreed immediately to credit $50 to our account.  I was still very disappointed, but I thanked her and said I understood.\n\nQueue moping.\n\nMy boyfriend suggested I have some wine and take a bath to cheer myself up, since our bathroom was equipped with a very nice soaking tub.  I dumped the whole mini bottle of shampoo into the tub and made myself a nice bubble bath and proceeded to relax.  A few minutes into my bath, I heard my boyfriend laughing in the other room.  I asked what he was laughing at, and he responded \""the fountains are going off.\""  I leapt out of the tub, covered in bubbles, wrapped a towel around myself and ran to the window, but I was too late.\n\nQueue more moping.  Please please please don't let that be the only time they go off tonight!  Fortunately, I got to see the fountains go off three more times (at half height, I believe), so I was content!  We were still given a $30 credit, since they did set the fountains off, but not nearly as much as they would on a regular night.\n\nOverall, I felt very pampered and comfortable, and I felt that the staff genuinely cared about my happiness.  Now if only I could afford to always stay in hotels as nice as this one!"
2,"Stick to the drinks, I don't recommend eating there.  Expensive food that is not worth the money."
3,"Awesome place to see a concert/show. Easy to get in and out, great seats from just about anywhere in the venue. Acoustics are surpurb, good ventilation so it's not stuffy or smokey. I'd definitely check out another act here!"
2,Basic sandwich shop. A good option for a quick lunch good quality.
2,"good work and friendly, a little pricy for the type of salon."
2,"I haven't been here ever since I left Vegas, however I enjoyed my lunches there.  I would go back if given the chance."
2,"Update: with new management and the one-year re-opening celebration in early October this year comes a completely different happy hour menu.\n\nOverall, I give the new happy hour 3/5 whereas their old set-up was a clear 5/5. They have raised their house margarita prices by $0.75 and none of their tequilas are half-off anymore (REALLY DISAPPOINTING!). They also now only have 3 or 4 featured tequilas that will apparently change up every once and awhile that are all priced at $4 a shot.\n\nAlso, they have their tacos individually priced on the HH menu, but you must order three at a time and you can't mix and match them either.  They also changed the recipes on the pork tacos (pray they did not change the fried fish ones, OR ELSE!) Not only that, but the tacos are not even discounted for happy hour. What. The. Hell. Whoever is running this place now obviously does not know what they are doing, because the poor waitresses have to explain the happy hour menu to every customer, new or old. \n\nThe ONLY positive would be the fact that the waitresses no longer have to dress in all-white outfits that looked a bit trashy. I always hated them. The new shirts are awesome, though, and I definitely want to buy one! It has that cool Dia de los Muertos sugar skull design they use on the side and the shirt itself is black. \n\nThis is no longer the best happy hour in Tempe. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore because this place USED to be my favorite. I still like it a lot, but change is not always good."
3,"Je suis rentrer au hasard dans ce petit resto, rien d'impressionnant a l'ext\u00e9rieur.\nMais le menu attention cela change !\n\nDes burgers tr\u00e8s original, exemple le mien avais du peanut butter dedans, sympathique !\n\nService: rapide.\nLe prix :10 12 dollars en trio avec une sacr\u00e9 assiette de frite tr\u00e8s bonne !\n\nBref une bonne surprise je dirai, je traverserai pas la ville pour y allez mais je sais ou allez manger la prochaine fois que je suis proche !"
3,"We tried this restaurant when we were in Las Vegas.  We had a group of eight.   The service here is great, very attentive and friendly.\n\nI had the chicken kiev which was crisp on the outside and juicy on the outside.  I had a cranberry cabbage salad that came with it which to me wasn't very flavorful, I would have preferred the red cabbage that others had.  \n\nOther members of our group ordered the pork, which was kind of dry.  The steak was good.  I had the mashed potatoes with my dinner instead of fries but I wish I would have ordered the fries.  They were home made, flavorful and delicious.\n\nWe had the cabbage rolls, herring and vegetable plate.   \nOthers in the group loved the cabbage rolls, me, not so much.  The herring was outstanding,  fresh and not too oily.  I was going to order the salmon but our server suggested the herring and I'm glad I took her advice.  The vegetable plate was displayed  beautifully   and everything on it was fresh.   The desserts were great as well\n\nOverall, the food was good , the service was excellent and the price was very reasonable.\n\nThe only downside to our visit is that when we exited we were accosted by a man who asked one of our party members \""to borrow 50 cents\"" .  It was a very unpleasant experience and I rwon't go into furhter details, but there is a liquor store in the same plaza and there were quite a few people loitering outside."
2,"I want to really like Sidelines.  I live so close.  The grilled wings are fantastic.  Best I've ever had, so big too!  The hamburgers are great too.  I've had the philly cheesesteak, but where's the beef!  Lots of bell pepper and onions, not worth the money.\n\nFairly clean but just look at the trash can by the drink station and kitchen and you wonder if the rest of the kitchen is that grimy.\n\nThe biggest problem is the atmosphere.  Like I said I really want to like this place but they overly cater to their \""regulars\"", at the expense of the new or occasional guest.  You can definitely feel ignored, like your business is not that appreciated...and I tip really well!"
4,"So we have been here probably 50-70 times, and this is the first time I am reviewing Mellow!!  I love this place. I believe that Mellow has the best beer selection in town with both rotating local and national micro brews. And of course the happy hour is half off all of the beer and other alcohol selection. So basically you can get a large 20oz beer for $3.50!\n\nThe pizza is also amazing. My personal favorite is the Thai dye pizza which has sweet chili sauce and chicken Curry. Sounds crazy but it is super good! I've also had the meat pizza, buffalo chicken pizza and they were all good. Also during happy hour all of the appetizers are half off and all are great!  You can't beat it!"
3,"My husband and I were most definately pleasantly suprised! We were so tired and starving and we were staying at arizona charlies so we didn't want to go anywhere far away. We were nervous about eating here and it was Saturday night and no line so we thought for sure we were in for it. The casheir was the nicest lady on the planet and she gave us a big fat discount!\nThe food was amazing, everything was delicious. Nothing was old or cold or weird and the salad bar did not taste like the lettuce came out of a bag. Which makes me super happy! And our server was awsome! Everyone here was friendly and pleasant and for a buffet it was decorated kinda classy! It was so good we went back again tonight! And for the price I think it was one of the best buffets I have eaten at in a very long time.  :)  very pleased."
2,"There are many mixed feelings about 5th and wine. the food is good. nothing spectacular, but not bad either. it is a little overpriced for the food, but it is fresh, just like the hangover from some of the staff. the staff is very friendly but you can tell they party. a lot.\n\nthe ginger snaps at the bar are a refreshing change to peanuts or other nonsense like that. the happy hour is great with 5 dollar wines. drunk comes quickly with this price. \n\nthe wifi is awesome and fast as it should be. the music is typically not bad, though occasionally there is a weird song from some obscure 90 year old artist that should not be covering justin beiber. \n\none gripe. the kitchen staff. they are way too loud. this is a true quote, \""i havent slept for four f***in days, man. i feel like shit. i dont know what the f*** is the matter with me.\"" this was heard very loudly into the restaurant. of course, this is common at some places, but it shouldnt be as though i were part of the conversation and it shouldnt happen here. \n\napart from that, the servers are really nice, though sweat alcohol. there are a lot of old people who frequent here, but that is not a drawback."
0,Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood
2,"As a FLorida transplant, I would compare Smith's to Publix Supermarkets. They are above average quality and maintain clean supermarkets. The staff are always pleasant and polite.\n\nThe three-star rating for this store stems mainly from the lack of selection (with certain products like yogurt) compared to the nearby Smith's on Sunset."
2,"Meh. The food is okay, not great, not bad. The front of the house was a mess and needs some serious attention to training. Our server came by for a drink order, listed 3 beers on special, and when we asked what type of beer one of the specials was, the response was, \""I don't know\"".... not, I'll go find out, just \""I don't know.\"" Later when ordering entrees we asked about a pasta dish, and the explanation from the server was literally, to read the description off of the menu over my shoulder. The homemade pasta was tasty, but stuck together too much. I'd rather go to The Parlor or Mr. Bianco's new \""Italian Restaurant\"" any day. This place has to fix the totally unenthusiastic front of the house for any hope of making it."
4,"Everybody that works here are very friendly. Any crepe you choose is very good, the one I like is \""The Elvis\""(it has peanut butter, bacon, banana, caramel on top with home made whip cream on the side) but you really can't go wrong with this place!"
0,"I have played here about a dozen times in 2011. The reason for the 1 star rating is we played a tournament here on July 16, 2011 and the greens were 100% unplayable. I've played on great greens, good greens, ok greens, lousy greens and now unplayable greens. These things are 50% bare with no grass AT ALL. The other reasons for the 1 star are (1) They do not give any warning when making a tee time that the greens are bad, not to mention completely lost. (2) After warming up on the putting green, about 3 putts is all I could stomach, I asked the starter \""Are the greens on the course like this?\"" He replied \""they're a little bumpy\"". Come on guys get real, be honest with people. This course is not worth $10 right now..............."
3,"I kid you not, we came here 3 days in a row straight for lunch! Yes, it's that good, consistently good. They have an extensive menu with many Vietnamese dishes that you can think of even though it's called Pho So 1. They have pho, hieu tieu (which was the crowd favorite), grilled plate, bun bo, rice and vermicelli noodle dishes, etc. Many of us ordered the pho but I thought the broth was a little off for me. I do like the bun bo though, lots of flavor. The girls who ordered the nem nuong or grilled beef, it came out on a huge platter! Prices are fair too. Complete your meal with a ca phe sua da phin (french ice coffee with condensed milk) like I did on all three days!"
4,"Sort of a family run place with the best Pho in the valley. Nothing fancy going on here, just good eats. I've never ordered anything except the Pho, so can't speak to the rest of the menu... But really, why would you order anything else?"
3,"I know everyone goes for the pizza (and the pizza is good).  But for my money, the burgers are where its at.  Some of the best burgers I've had in town.  Great reuse of this place from its beauty parlor days."
2,"Wicked Spoon seems to be one of the cheaper alternatives as far as buffets go. I'd give it 3.5 stars. They offer a pretty diverse selection of foods, and for an additional $8 on top of the $29 rate for brunch, you can also get unlimited mimosas! Heyyyyy! (:\n\nThe food itself was mediocre, nothing really stood out to me. I did appreciate how many of the dishes were presented in smaller portions. This allowed me to literally try a little bit of everything, without feeling bad about wasting it if I didn't like it. \n\nI was pretty impressed with the dessert selection, having such a huge sweet tooth. A full gelato station, chocolate covered strawberries and marshmallows, cookies, mini cakes and pastries, and so forth, all presented so beautifully! I felt bad eating them because they were so pretty! \n\nOur server was very friendly and attentive, making conversation with us throughout our meal and quickly clearing our tables and coming back with more mimosas."
2,"Hot Dog on a Stick! If you come here, you must always leave with two things: a Hot Dog on a Stick and a Giant Lemonade! No reason not too! I tried Popeyes for the first time which is located next to this place and it was plain and boring. This place always does the trick and the workers did their job and nothing special stood out. Aside from the short lines that were present. I easily would choose to eat this in San Francisco and would eat it in any other town."
0,The person who answered the phone when I called to book an appointment was very rude. It made me not want to come to this location and when she said they didn't have an appointment available for the day I wanted I was fine with it and called the Myers Park location. Poor customer service
4,Hey this place got reviewed in the AZ Republic!\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/dining/articles/2010/11/29/20101129beaver-choice-tempe-review.html\n\nCheck out the link!
2,"port of subs.....   sliced meat fresh in front of you to edge them out over subway....  They have changed their menus since I have last been in there....   I ordered a small Blackforest Ham with provolone on Wheat with spicy mustard... it was great and exactly what I was looking for for lunch.  I think the price was sub 4 bucks too which was also a bonus.   There was kind of a long line and it was understaffed considering the time of day it was (lunch)    all in all, it was a great experience and I would go back to this particular one again should I need a quick bite."
1,"Hey, if I had known that there would be portion control on everything, I would have gone to Prime or any other restaurant on the Strip. I was not impressed with anything at this restaurant, except the decor. The service was not there and the same for the food. For the price that I paid for a dinner, the basket of rolls should have been on the table. Instead, you would get two tiny bread rolls, with \""cold butter.\"" How can you spread cold butter? Anyway, the meal so so memorable that I can't even remember one thing that I enjoyed at this restaurant.! I will not return for sure, but rest assure that other restaurants will get my business."
1,"This place is starting to show it's age.  The casino and lobby/registration areas are in dire need of a make over.  The rooms have recently been upgraded and I'm not a fan.  The pepto-bismol pink in the bathroom almost burned out my retinas.  And the frosted sliding glass door on the bathroom?  Bad idea. If you have to go to the restroom in the middle of the night, that light is going to seep into the sleeping area and not be very diffused.\n\nThe location on the strip is great though.  It's easily within walking distance to just about everywhere."
2,"Quite frankly, I'm not sure how the reviews for this place are so good. We went for lunch for Restaurant Week, and it was really pretty meh.\n\nStarted with the smoked salmon on crostini--definitely the highlight of the meal. The smoked salmon was done in-house and seasoned well. Really good. The greens that came with it, though, were oily and overdressed. Points off.\n\nFor the entree, all three of us got the short ribs--they were really, really mediocre. I mean...just not that good. The pieces were overly fatty (so much so that there wasn't much meat on them), there was a bizarre, hoisin-like sauce on top and then a random piece of parsley (maybe cilantro?). Honestly, the dish came across as confused. The mixed rice told me they were going for Asian inspiration, but the flavors just didn't really work. What meat was actually on the short ribs was good, but didn't stand out.\n\nDessert was profiteroles--the ice cream was absolutely delicious, but let's be realistic--everything that comes from Babcock Hall is delicious. Profiteroles were good, but nothing special. Whipped cream wasn't as thick as it should've been, and was really falling apart.\n\nI debated giving them 2 stars, but the salmon was truly great, as was the service. As for whether I'd go back? No. Restaurant Week is an opportunity for a place to show off how good it is, so I'm willing to go back when it's not RW. Veranda certainly didn't do that."
1,"Good beans, very nice interior, proper handiwork behind the machine, self serve water, faux crackling fireplace (on a flatscreen) are the highlights.\n\nBut the coffee is lacking depth & refinement you can find at Cafe Plume, Pikolo, Myriade, Flocon, N\u00e9v\u00e9, and Pourquoi Pas amongst others.\n\nService was straight forward and formal.  Tips given were unacknowledged.\n\nI tried the powdered sugar dusted chausson aux pommes: definitely skip it.  This should be a last-resort purchase only if you're dying of hunger.  Browning: non-existent, butter/apple flavor: I searched and did not find, texture: lacking crunch but was somewhat flaky.  \n\nCome for the quiet, warm, relaxed atmosphere and to bask in the short-lived winter afternoon sunshine streaming through the front window."
1,"Not all Asian markets are made equal.  Tan Phat is no exception.  And we have not been impressed by this store...sadly, too, as it's so close to home.\n\nHere's the run down.  The organization of the store is fine.  At one end they have large refrigerators (maybe freezers?) and kitchen tools/dining supplies.  At the other they have produce.  Along the back wall they have a variety of fresh meats.  I'll admit, we've bought very little here, though partly because we were unable to FIND what we were looking for.  Everything in between seems to be organized by categories, some very specific some very broad: there's an aisle for rice noodles, almost exclusively, and another for Indian products.\n\nWhile the store is pretty large (two or three times the size of our favorite little Viet store back in Utah), the selection seems to be pretty sparse.  The shelves have a lot of the same taking up a lot of the space.  We have tried to find flat broad wheat noodles (which seem to be hard to find in Phoenix, to be fair) and Hon-dashi, both to no avail.  We also were unable to find anything but soft tofu on one visit.\n\nI think the biggest hang up for me, just before the lack of merchandise, is the difficulty we've had in communicating with the staff.  While I'm by no means an ardent believer of \""In Murica we speak English!\"" I feel that if you're going to open a business that does draw a diverse clientele (I've seen others of various backgrounds, who also don't speak Vietnamese) it's important to expand your vocabulary enough to meet the needs and answer the questions of patrons.  This does not appear to be a priority for this business, and, as such, we're willing to make the drive to LF Market on Bell Rd instead.\n\nI've also noticed others mention the cleanliness of the store and, well, I don't really care, to be honest.  I've noticed lots of stores similar to Tan Phat are comparably dingy.  It's not a priority for me, though.  I actually kind of like that feel over the sterilized feeling in most American grocery stores.\n\nNow, if you speak Vietnamese, and your wants are within their stock, by all means, come here.  We still do, sometimes, but it's certainly _not_ our go-to store."
2,"Wow.  The reviews for this place are all over the place and I can pretty much see how they're all spot on.  This place is still in its infancy.  Some things are great.  Others not so good.  Depending on when you go your experience can go either way.  First, my bias is toward downtown and CenPho businesses.  The area where Lola Coffee is located is changing and, with a little luck, will be happing in the not-too-distant future.  I give a lot of credit to Lola's owners for picking the location and opening a new business in this market.  I want this place to succeed and will definitely give it another go.\nMy daughter and I visited Lola the first time twenty minutes before closing (7:00PM - a ridiculously early time for a coffee house but that's another issue).  Before ordering we were asked if we were aware they would be closing in twenty minutes.  Undeterred, we ordered a couple of lattes and took a seat at the very well done wooden bar facing Central Avenue.  The lattes were good, if a little cool, and the ambience of the entire place is pretty great.  It took me a while to get over the cool greeting by the staff but I began to warm to the place.  Hey, one of counter girls even asked us if everything was OK.  Things were looking up.\nI visited Lola a second time by myself to get a coffee to go.  Service this time was much like the first time.  Hurried, frazzled (though there was no one behind me) and way too cool for this unsettling economy.  Now, I'm not expecting anyone to jump across the counter in gratitude but a smile and a simple \""thank you\"" would go a long way toward giving this place another star.  \nSo here's my take on Lola.  I want it to succeed and will continue to go back.  The coffee (at least mine) was good.  I appreciated the pitcher of ice water on the bar (a la Lux?) and the overall decor.  BUT, in this weak economy I do expect the service to be ratcheted up A LOT.  Here's to hoping that will be the case."
2,"I'm trying to be a fair reviewer but to be honest I came into here with high expectations due to two coworkers telling me it was GREAT. I thought it was standard good burger. The meat was flavorful and moist and cooked medium rare like I asked, but the rest of my classic burger was unremarkable. I thought the burger was a fair size but the delicious fries that came as a side disappeared so fast! It comes in a tiny cup that is around 4 oz. The service was really fast but almost too fast - we couldn't get anyone's attention when we wanted an extra plate and our salad was whisked away before we finished it. Overall, a little disappointed but probably the best place for a burger in Las Vegas."
1,"If you are a serious gambler, you will NOT appreciate the attitude of the craps dealers at Palazzo.  Take the time to walk less than 5 minutes to the Venetian.  These have to be some of the most professional, and enjoyable dealers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting."
4,"The wait was not long. Bummer they just opened and were only doing a special St Patrick's day menu. The food was good. Service was good for as busy as it was. Our waitress was so cute and was fresh from Ireland.For  real! My hubby got the fish and chips. He recieved one HUGE piece of fish. I had a burger, it was good. Like something your mom would throw together by making a burger by hand.  It was not some already shaped and formed patty.  Our friends got the pie and the rueben. They didn't share. But they enjoyed it.  We went to see Flogging Molly after dinner. The Irish pub fit well for pre-concert dinner! The seating chicks at the front did look rather glum though. I think one was swearing under her breath.  Seriously cheer up ladies!! Is it that bad? Good food, good service. Gotta get past the unhappy hostess."
0,"I went to lunch here at Ra on Ray 2/18/13 with a co worker. The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes. Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for \""Nichole\"" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us. The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen. Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away. We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her, so she takes our drink order. Finally my salmon carpaccio comes, luke warm, and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo.... not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio... my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when \""Nichole\"" walks up grabs the bowl and says \""are you finished?\"" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating... so she tells her to go ahead and take it. It has been 35 minutes now... NO drinks, and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found.... So we just walked out... LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather \""NO\"" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's\n    PS.... the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :("
1,First time the food was good but the service was so slow. The second time the service was still slow but then they were out of some of the juices we wanted. We figured we would go back a third time and even joked on the way there about them running out of items. This time not only was the service lacking but they were out of all of their fresh juices and the majority of their salads. It was 11:30 in morning and I couldn't believe they were out of so much. When our salads finally came the chicken was so hard it seemed old. They had also messed up my friends order. When we told the waitress our concerns and we were unhappy she brought the check then disappeared. We didn't even eat the lunch and payed a $60 tab. So disappointing we will never go back. Too bad because I was excited for a new healthy food spot.
4,Awesome beer! Best pilsner ever! Check the Facebook page for their special events including food trucks that stop by. And careful with the Barley Wine!
0,"(Please note that this review has been updated due to the reasons stated below) \n10/1 MyToilets and bathtubs were backed up due to a clogged sewer line. Joe arrived ahead of scheduled time window and was super friendly and quoted me a fair price and also gave me a 10%senior discount. He completed the job in about 30 minutes and made sure all drains and toilets were draining and flushing properly before leaving. I then asked him if the backflow tube in the outside area was cleaned up of all toilet paper and fecal matter that he had cleaned out.He assured me he had taken care of it and there was only a small amount left around the drain that would break down and decompose quickly. He also told me he used some of my bleach in my laundry area(which was fine and I would have even loaned him my hose as well to finish cleaning up the considerable amount of fecal matter and toilet paper in my flower bed).  As he had been so professional and courteous to this point, I took him at his word and did not check the backflow area myself before he left.\n I had a packaged delivered yesterday afternoon from UPS on my doorstep. While outside, I walked down to the backflow area to see if everything was still draining properly. To my shock there were still large chunks of toilet paper and a considerable amount of fecal matter encompassing a 20-24 inch radius around the backflow area..I immediately called Pure Plumbing back and spoke with a woman named Jessica. I began explaining what had transpired and that he had checked the inside area of the bathroom and had done a professional job inside the house trying to tell her all background information regarding the issue.. She tersely interrupted me and stated\"" \""Well, what is the problem then\"" I was only trying to give her some back ground information so she could better assist me. She told me that she would have to transfer me to a customer service administrator. I then spoke to Alexis and told her what had happened and that I wrote a great review due to his professionalism and  courtesy and  in all areas of work and service based on what he did inside the house and told me about the backflow outside.She thanked me for the review, however I told her that I would not be honest with Pure Plumbing or myself without informing them of what had happened in regards to the backflow area being left in an unacceptable condition (i.e. hygeine  soiled toilet paper). I told her I felt like I was due some type of credit as this was a serious hygiene issue that should have been cleaned up before he left and I was left to spend my own time to try and clean the mess up. She assured me she would call back as soon as possible after speaking with her supervisor and let me know if a credit could be issued.\n\n10/2 .I finally received a call back this afternoon on my voicemail.at approximately noon today  Alexis said she spoke with her supervisor and that they would be applying a 10% discount to my bill(total bill 148.50) and that I should see a credit within several business days. End of call. No apology or explanation was offered for my inconvenience or the dishonesty of assuring me the backflow area had been cleaned up. I took the hose out to the area and sprayed for over 20 minutes yesterday afternoon. (I have a severely degenerative left ankle and it is difficult to stand for more than 5-10 minutes). I stopped for the afternoon due to fatigue and went out again this morning and sprayed the area again for another 20- 25 minutes to try and finish breaking up the soiled toilet paper and fecal matter . I have now spent more time cleaning up the toilet paper and fecal matter than the entire service call that I was billed for. I had originally given a 5 star review, but cannot in good conscience leave it at a 5 star rating due to his dishonesty and the way the problem was resolved by management. If you do use this company, I would strongly advise that you visually inspect all areas of work before they leave. I'm very disappointed as he had originally  presented himself and his company in a very professional manner and I felt confident in the choice I had made to resolve my plumbing issue\n\nJay"
4,Nice little breakfast place that's hopping.  Atmosphere is good and the food is pretty tasty.
4,"My husband and I came here visiting my brother, his fianc\u00e9, and her extended family.  Her family I guess are regulars.  It was a special family occasion as well.  As a group we started with a custom seafood platter.   Being from the Pacific Northwest and currently living on the California coast, I'm hesitant on eating seafood in a land lock state (horrible past experience), but it was not to disappoint.  It was all fresh, not over cooked, not rubbery, and not waterlogged.  I even ate a few raw oysters and they tasted very fresh.  All the steaks (because why would you eat fish at a steakhouse or bring a vegetarian here?) were cooked perfectly.  The plates were hot.  The waiter served the sides to each individual at the beginning.  I had the creamed corn, asparagus, and sweet potato fries; all were cooked properly and came out hot.  We had a dessert platter of every dessert they had to share, which of course was fantastic.   Key lime, chocolate covered strawberries, and every type of yummy goodness.   Every little detail I would expect in a high-end restaurant that most people might not see was there.  Not one drink went below half full.  It did start to get a little loud but that was due to the table next to us.  When they reached a peak and the entire dinning room looked, they realized this and quiet down.  My husband and I are about to go back for a visit with my brother; we're going back for dinner."
3,"First the important thing... The drinks are amazing. Of course they have three of my favorite bartender's in town Megan, Chris, and Diane. The decor is nice and has a good size bar.\n\nNow for the food... We tried a few different kinds of tacos the chicken had a nice spice, the beef was a little salty, and the pork was way to sweet. The chips and salsa rocked. Oh did I mention the margaritas... Lol.\n\nAll and all a cool place to hang out have some cocktails/food. We will be back I wish you were just a little bit closer to home."
2,I went here with no reservation and they took me on however is little bit pricey and the level of nail game is not up to par. They gave me a discount using check in and still came out to $95
1,"I wont be returning to this chain anytime soon, it was pricey for a sub and there are better options around. This place reminds me of 5 guys hamburger joint, but I liked that place better than this one. I ate my food and went on my way and havent went back since. I suggest you try it atleast once the food is decent and it will go down just fine but after you look at the reciept you may wish you went to Subway or just made one yourself."
2,"I visited this store recently while waiting for someone to fly into the Scottsdale Airport (it's right down the street).  The store was packed full of furniture and decorative items - most with a cottage but modern feel.  There was a broad range of quality...some expensive furniture that looked very high quality, and some more standard chippy, shabby chic low end pieces.  The layout of the store could be more thoughtfully arranged and it definitely could use some 'editing.'  A lot of things were just heaped on top of other things, but a good stylist could shape this store up easily.\nIn the hour I was there, not a single person offered any assistance, which was fine with me since I was browsing, but I wouldn't want to have to track down a live human here for help."
2,"The only reason I want to try this little dive tucked away on a barely lit street was because my dear dad saw it listed in one of his cooking magazines since it had been featured on DDD (you know the show I mean). I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection! I am not a burger person, but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me! When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!\n\nI did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.\n\nMy meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.\n\nAnother comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness. Darren seems used to it (swearing that \""they aren't being rude\"")...and if this is what you get used to here, I am heartbroken. Is friendly service too much to ask for?\n\nIf I decide to come back, I will try a different sandwich."
0,"I'm all for dive bars but The Pub gives dive bars everywhere a bad name. I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll begin and end with the same statement: It's known as \""The Pube\"" to locals. I hope that's enough said."
4,"This place is freaking nutts! Super mega club. Went here for LDW 2010 and maybe thats why it was overly crowded, but I didnt mind because it was crowded with more chicks then guys...drinks are average prices. Music was very good, as well as the outdoor set up."
0,"Don't bother coming here. Scottsdale has so many other great places to eat. The patio was cute, but the misters were not turned on which became very uncomfortable for a hot Arizona summer night...inside seating is available. The one star was for our service and food quality. Our server forgot to put my order in and got my friends order wrong. Rarely checked in and had to call her over a few times. It was not very busy in her section, so no reason for her to be unattentive. Expensive and not that great. A MEH experience at best for a $70 tab."
0,Absolutely the longest I've ever waited for a sandwich.  Not worth it. Skip this place. Its seriously like they start planting the grain when you order the bread.
4,"Great value for a sit down place. Food was good. Getting into the parking lot was a little tight, but manageable."
3,If I don't tell how would you know about one of the greatest foot message I have ever received while getting a pedi. So great!
3,"its great to have a club that allows you to escape the noise and busyness to an outside area where you can talk to the special someone you just met at the bar.\n\nConsistently packed with the better than average looking and dressed crown, it's suprisingly easy to get in the front door.  Be a little bit patient and polite at the front door, pay a hefty cover, and that's it.  Inside, it's a little confusing trying to find the bathroom or exit, but there's staff around to direct you as you wander around lost your first time there."
0,I had a really bad experience with my nail technician and it was my first time being there. I don't want to point her by name but she was so negative about everything and kept saying she can't wait to get off work and not come in the next day. She kept rolling her eyes and even freaked out when she thought one of the other nail techs stole her nail polish but it was sitting in front of her the whole time. I told her that I wanted a full pink and white set and she didn't even do that. She put regular acrylic and made me go pick out a color.  She even made me bleed and when I pointed it out. She looked surprised and said she'll clean it up for me and continues doing my nails but never cleaned the blood up. She did not seemed interested in being there and doing her job at all. I prepaid through MyTime app and she tried charging me. I kept telling her that I already paid for the service and she did not seem to comprehend that. It's unfortunate because the guys who were doing other customer's nails seemed very upbeat and friendly and knew what they were doing but I will never go back because of the one pessimistic nail tech who did my nails
4,"Yusho is absolutely wonderful! I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful the staff and food are. The duck in particular is fantastic. While it's a little difficult to get to, it's entirely worth it once you're in the restaurant."
3,"What a cool place to visit with (or without) kids. We drove by The Farm and hubby and I stopped in because I knew they sold eggs here. We were not expecting to have an experience. This place is incredibility eclectic and inviting. If you are drawn to the hippie esthetic, come by with your camera and snap a few pics. There are chickens meandering around the property and little ones can interact with the animals on site. \n\nThere is no strict organization to The Farm. And I love that. Yes, there are different areas to walk through, but it feels like the [lace has grown in the decades it has been in the location. Each area feels like its own special space. \n\n1) There is the chicken coop area where chickens and bunnies are housed\n2) There is the general caged area where goats and peacocks and roosters and a myriad of other animals are housed\n3) And there is the large animal viewing area where the horses, emus, hogs, and more are housed\n\nPlus there is a large shaded seating area for those of us with weary bones. \n\nThey also sell fresh eggs, apple cider, vegetables, and baked goods. \n\nThis place is so laid back and easy. It just doesn't feel like Vegas to me. The best part of the visit was seeing the large Peacock, Mr. Something (I forgot this gal's name). We listened as the owner was feeding the hog and sharing some of the peacock's history with a group of children. This peacock was raised by a little girl an is comfortable being close to people. The little ones were beside themselves with glee at getting a chance to see (and feed) the beautiful bird. \n\nBring $40 for snacks and such and make sure you have two hours to kill. This is not a place to rush. With an honor system $1 entry fee, there are not many places in town where you can see so much for so little."
3,"I usually go here during happy hour. 5-7pm & 12am-2am half price pizzas and drinks. Food & service here for the most part has been decent on my visits here. Their happy hour used to be 3hrs twice a day but they cut it down from 5-8pm & 12-3am back in September. Sometimes it does take a bit to catch someone's attention. Surprisingly decent food for a bar.  Their Gilroy pizza is the bomb! Thin crust white garlic sauce pizza with salami, pepperoni, artichokes, onions, tomatoes & mushrooms. During happy hour large 16\"" pizzas are half priced at $10. I would eat here on ocassion after work if it coincided with happy hour."
0,I don't know why people like this place. There wasn't anything wrong with the service but the food was awful. Very weird... Especially the salsa and sauces.
0,I was craving pizza really bad and we had a menu at our store for this place. So I decided to try it out and got it. I was starving by the time they came and the pizza was still a dissapointment. I paid 20 dollars for the pizza and breadsticks the large pizza was small. The same size as little ceasers $5 pizza and the quality is worse than that of ceasers. Both the pizza and breadsticks was over cooked. Im realky pissed I wasted my hard earned money here. I couldnt even ask anyone else to help pay for the pizza because it was so gross and I picked the place. I really want a refund! Do not order from here
3,"Ate at the Nile Cafe last night. It's a medium sized restaurant in a strip mall. Sparse decor with a couple of TVs. VERY family friendly, as the proprietor had his kid there. \n\nThe best part about the place was the kind, attentive service. Our pretty waitress and the owner both thanked us a couple of times for stopping in. They just seemed really grateful.\n\nAs other reviewers noted, the small sampler plate of hummus was a nice free starter. I had the salad with my dinner. It was a basic plate of lettuce (with a decent dressing). I recommend the lentil soup, instead.\n\nI had the gyro schwarama, which came with a generous portion of rice. It was enough to have left overs for lunch today, but it was all a bit greasy (though, in their defense, greek is almost always a bit greasy). Tender, flavorful meat.\n\nThe highligh of the meal was the caring servers."
3,"This is just outside C security check point to the right. If I hadn't been actively looking for it (believe me, that chai was gonna happen) I might have missed it. \nIt's one of the newer Starbucks at Sky Harbor & I love that they made it more like an actual cafe, with plenty of seating. \nGranted, even though the person who took my order wrote my name on my cup, the person who made it did not call it out, instead they said the type of drink..... a woman grabbed my drink (& so did I) & although I tried reasoning with her & telling her my name was on the cup, she insisted it was hers.... people who are caffeine deprived are scary, but fortunately in this location, you know they are not armed, LOL!. The Barista had to step in, pry her fingers off my cup & tell her that hers was coming up. The airport is always an adventure! :)"
3,"Close to where I live and the food is nothing but delicious. Only the second time here but nothing like tamales to warm your stomach on a cold evening!! Service is fast, food comes out hot and the service seems to be pretty fast. It's kinda like a hole in the wall Mexican joint that serves a purpose. Decor is everywhere but good to watch games at and relax."
1,"OH DEAR LORD! (and not in a good way) \n\nSo I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year now. This past Saturday I finally convince the hubs to go with me. \n\nThis is a place that takes donations from people who are renovating their homes, you can find anything home related as far as building materials and the like go. \n\nI was pumped on finding a bath vanity, people have reported that they have stuff there from high end homes. \n\nWe must have been on a very very off day as everything there looked to be from the 80's mayyyybe 90's and older. Nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days. \n\nThe appliances they offer there are old as hell as well, there wasn't anything worth looking at. And used toilets? EW!"
4,"Camelback is easily one of my favorite places in Phoenix. I'd highly suggest going RIGHT NOW, because when my husband and I hiked the Echo Canyon trail on Saturday it was gorgeous! All the rain has turned the mountain green -- well, as green as it will turn. It is still a desert, after all. Anyway, there is grass and weeds and wildflowers and moss all over- it's like a new mountain!\n\nThe one thing I don't get about Camelback, however, is how EVERY time I do it, no matter how many times I've done it before, my legs still ache like hell the next day. Oh well.\n\nIn addition to the great workout, hiking the mountain exposes you to a great slice o'life. I've seen it all here -- flabby men hiking in speedos, little chihuahuas that ascend this thing faster than I do, helicopter rescues, girlfriends nearly breaking up with their boyfriends because they don't want to go all the way to the top, and people from all over the country, and the world, who make sure to hike the mountain while they're in Phoenix. Very cool. \n\nThere is one minor annoyance I have with this place -- and that's the people who hike the entire thing, up and down, at a regular pace... then run the last 5 minutes like a bat out of hell. You're not fooling anyone, toolboxes, we all know you didn't run the whole thing. Quit pretending, and quit knocking me off the trail!"
1,"The room was comfortable but loud and by 10 dollars it was the better deal on the strip. On my next trip I will be paying that 10 dollars so that I can have better service and a nicer room, probably at Mandalay or Palms. \n\nCustomer service at this airportesque casino/hotel was really bad. I spoke with probably around 10 different MGM employees over the course of my stay and the 9th person was really nice. Everyone up until then had been impolite. A lot of it was people just speaking in that \""I'm not going to take any crap\"" type of voice and being unhelpful. So on my reservation I had written it was my anniversary and reserved a room with a King bed. Upon check-in I learned that one does not reserve a room type one 'requests' it. Apparently the largest hotel on earth was out of king beds. So we got two beds. Hm not too happy. Then the next day I call to switch and the person on the phone was so rude about it I just gave up. \n\nI'm reluctant to give the MGM 2 stars because I feel like it's one of the better places to stay, but given my experience with them I can't lie. It sucked. I may try again in the future and pray for the best."
2,"Went to a rehearsal dinner in August 2011 at Prime. The place is beautiful. Everyone was in place and the guests all looked fantastic. \n\nThe food was of course really expensive and the portions were small. We all took a group photo.. and each guest got a copy that was very nice so we could remember the evening. \n\nUntil the manager realized he had made a mistake and they were not paid for. He immediately took all the photos back and told us if we wanted them we had to purchase them for $40!! \n\nAll in all it was a good time, long walk for Aria Hotel but I would say it was worth it."
0,Worst customer service in history! After watching the employee try and prepare a salad that was taking over 15 minutes and seeing him handle money then keep trying to prepare my salad I was disgusted. When I proceeded to tell them I wanted a refund and they refused and they said they didn't like me as a customer. Who says that??? Because I didn't want to eat the salad that took over 15 minutes to prepare and who was handling my food with dirty hands. Absolutely worst place ever! Do not recommend to anyone!
3,"JK might've written bits of HP here, but I'm sure I read an interview in which she gave that honour to a completely different cafe on Nicholson Street, now closed. \nElephant House have certainly staked their claim in letters writ large though, which means you can't walk past this cafe without ending up in someone's holiday snaps. It also means it's very busy at lunchtime. The sign says get your food before bagsying a table, but you're unlikely to be sitting while you eat unless you have an accomplice to throw your coats onto a couple of chairs while you're in the queue.\nThe food is quite good, I think. I've had some delicious paninis there and some very nice pastries. And not that expensive in my opinion. Service is usually quite fast - they have to be given the popularity of the place, and you can get stuff to take away too. If you have elephant phobia then steer clear, the predominant theme in this cafe's decor is elephant.\nAnd yes, if you can get a window seat the views are lovely."
3,"Good food made and served by actual Thai people. Coming from the west coast, a lot of people have misconceptions about how Thai food should taste. While it wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had, it was very good. They are also not afraid to spice your food up if you ask them to. Most places are very shy with heat but they will make it searing hot here if you like I that way. The thing that stood out the most about this place was the wonderful service and family atmosphere of the people running the house. Our server was spot on with her service and the owner stopped by our table to check on us and fill our water. They are very good at communicating everything. Truly exceptional service. We will be back!!"
2,"Great drunchie spot. I think Joe's is better tho.\n\nI actually have a collection of pictures of people who have fallen asleep at Gus'. Maybe I'll upload them later, lol."
2,"If you are staying at Planet Hollywood, PBR serves a decent breakfast that's not horribly overpriced.  \n\nGOOD: Three eggs (not just your usual two) cooked overeasy and thcik cut baked cooked just right are perfect for offsetting last night's booze.  \n\nBAD: The service here was pretty slow - seriously, how long does it take to make eggs and bacon and fry tater tots?  Also, there' s not choice of bacon or sausage just bacon.\n\nUGLY: They were blaring rap and R&B before noon.  Isn't this supposed to be a country joint?!  Gimme my George Strait."
2,"Ok...so last night we only needed a few things to make the evening successful...\n\n1) Televisions showing the first (official) football game of the season (Giants vs. the icky Cowboys...hey, it's MY review and I can call them whatever I want!)\n2) Full bar...or in lieu of a full bar, at least a working fridge with jack, coke, jager and bud light...(oh yeah, we're high falootin' aren't we?)\n3) Enough wherewithal to pretend that something is on 'happy hour special'...we're ok if the place just makes something up...\n\nAnd for fulfilling our needs rather well, and our wonderful server Holly, I am delivering 3 stars...yes, the jager was a little pricey (I believe it was $5/itty bitty shot), but since that wasn't part of the 3 commandments, I'm not gonna ding this place for points...\n\nHubby went with the patty melt and spicy fries, I decided to go for the gold and ordered a bacon mushroom cheeseburger (also with spicy fries)...the fries were yummy, I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms on the burger, but the bun, burger, cheese and bacon were delightful...or maybe that was the jack & coke talking...if so, it doesn't matter, when my belly and brain are happy, EVERYONE is happy. \n\nTowards the end of our excursion, they rolled in the karaoke, so it started getting a little louder and we decided to take our party elsewhere, but after visiting 3 other totally packed sports bars, we're happy we were able to find this little neighborhood gem.  \n\nGood prices, decent food, not jam-packed with tools. Sweet!"
3,"I live nearby and have been to this restaurant many times.\n\nThe food - good - always tasty and I can recommend the sweet and sour soup, tofu vegetables, pork and vegetables, beef and broccoli - never had a bad dish here.\n\nThe service - better to do take-out than dine-in.  They don't have a lot of help so you wait a long time.  This might be a family business.  I'm not sure.  But if you call in your order, they have it ready fast."
3,"I went with my boyfriend today. We got the Mushroom and Swiss and the Drunky Duck. Both were very good. I preferred the duck and he preferred the mushroom. It's a cool looking space. The tables have little gears in them giving it a cool steam punk touch. The staff were very helpful and nice. They have a solid tap selection - Karben4, Ale Asylum, New Glarus. The prices are also fair. Definitely not overpriced. \n\nMy only constructive criticism would be that the buns are lackluster. They should have them baked locally or make their own. They just couldn't compare to the delicious meat and fixings inside of them. Obviously they weren't bad, but just when compared to the gourmet level sausage... It is no way a reason I won't be back here a few days from now to try another sausage variety. Seriously so good.\nRather I hope they see this and up the ante (whole wheat! - *nudge nudge*).\n\nAll in all you must come try this place.\n\nI'm excited to support a new local business and can't wait to try the cheese curds other yelpers are raving about!"
2,"Great food but extremely slow lunch service. Had to wait 45 mins for our food today from the time our order was taken. We'll still be back, just extremely disappointed with the slow service. Only saw our waitress 1 time while waiting on our food."
2,We were hungry and did not want to eat at Denny's or Ala Cart Steak house; so we came here for some Mexican food.  The food was ok and the service was mediocre.  I am from san diego so I expect great things from a Mexican food place such as Amigo's.  So I was not impressed or disappointed but I did walk away with a full belly and way over priced food bill.   Will not return any time soon!
2,Based on the previous reviews i was super excited to eat here. However i was a bit disapointed. Fried chicken was kind of bland but nice and juicy and the fried catfish was kind of soggy. Mac and cheese and greens were very good. Service was slow.
1,"These should be delicious doughnuts, unfortunately, after around 4 visits, they're generally stale and greasy. I think this probably has something to do with the store's haphazard location and also because I've literally never seen more than 3 or 4 people inside at any given time. Also, the doughnuts are small (which is cool), but also very expensive for what you get. Go to dunkin doughnuts or make your own."
1,"Hrmm...had to try it. Cheesy.\nIt was either this place or the healthy Mediterranean place across the way. Pssh...I'm in Vegas betch.\n\nWe were \""admitted\"" to this place and given a hospital gown and bracelet. The nurse was hot, so was the doctor. This sounds like the beginning of some smut film. Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin. \nSome folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining. \n\nWe ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here."
2,"I was really, really excited to try out this new Willy St. spot.  My first experience left me disappointed. \n\nHere's what was good:\n1. It was my favorite dish of the evening, so you'd think I'd remember the name...  It was a pasta stuffed with venison. Absolutely fantastic!\n2. The chocolate beignets for dessert were terrific. \n\nHere is how the experience can be improved:\n1. Put a dimmer switch on the lights. Damn, it's bright in there! I really enjoyed the communal seating approach, but I don't light so bright that my neighbor can see my pores! \n2. Tighten up the staff's presentation and performance. They were sloppy. From the \""uniforms\"" to the food delivery to the timeliness to the billing. All were off and definitely took away from the overall evening. \n3. Give us some serving spoons! All the dishes are meant to share, but no serving spoons were provided. I found this a bit odd. \n4. Open kitchen? Keep it clean! If you're going to have an open kitchen concept - keep it orderly and clean - at least where customers can see! Dirty plates, dirty aprons and a cook chugging cans of Sprite all evening were not the most appealing view inside of the kitchen.\n\nI'll give it another shot at some point. They definitely need to step it up if they are to legitimately compete against other Willy St. and downtown options."
1,"Very disappointed. \n\nThe restaurant is very dark. I have decent eyesight but needed to use the candles on the table to see the menu. My poor parents needed to ask for a flashlight, which the hostess already was carrying. That just goes to prove that they know it is too dark in the restaurant for some people to read the menu. . . or even see the food. \n\nMy sister and her husband ordered the pork shoulder tacos. They liked them very much. But, they also admitted that the pork should tacos are the only thing they will order on the menu. Mission- there are your two stars!\n\nMy parents ordered chicken tacos and asked they be mild. They weren't mild.  My mother could barely eat them. Thanks for listening Ms. Waitress. \n\nI ordered the a soup that the waitress said would be very hearty. The soup  tasted. . . well, it had no taste.  It was like watery broth with tasteless pork at the bottom. Not good and not hearty.\n\nI told the waitress that I did not like it and she said, \"" Oh, bummer. Can I bring you something else?\""  Since everyone was almost done with their meals I declined and just ate chips and salsa. \n\nThe bill?  Yeah, it included my tasteless soup that I did not eat. Pretty tacky."
4,"If you need anything for martial arts this place is it. Friendly and knowledgable staff. The owner knows just about everyone in the martial arts community. Heck he knew all my past instructors (not sure if he knows my current instructor, he probably knows him) lol.\n\nUniforms, they carry all types and weights (from lightweight to heavy weight). If you want to your kicks and hand techniques to sound awesome, buy the heavyweight uniform. The prices are very reasonable and they will go above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nWeapons, they carry just about everything. Shoes, posters...all martial arts, all everything about martial arts."
4,"I called for a quote yesterday and it sounded too good to be true. I pulled up this morning and after a ten minute look over, he gave me the same price and got started right away after I gave the go ahead. Fast and inexpensive service with awesome quality. Exactly what I was looking for. Can't leave my wife and daughter home alone too long."
2,"Another one of the new places in the food court at the Excalibur Hotel. Like the other food places there, they are currently offering special deals so be sure to take advantage of them while you still can! I recommend getting their lemonade if you feel like drinking something chilled and refreshing (and are tired of drinking water lol). Also a good place for a quick bite. Their fries are pretty good."
1,"Ok, I bought a minivan from my parents who had the best and most costly tires on it from big-o along with the insurance/warranty for them all.  one of the tires blew out and I thought since they were the best and new with warranty they would be covered but after I had it replaced they wanted to charge me full price and I had to fight with them to take a look at my warranty papers. I would have thought they would have it on file on their computers, but they dint.  I ended up paying full price for the replacement tire for reasons they couldn't really explain to me and I just got tired of arguing and paid it and left.  I just recently replaced the whole set after only 8 months of wear, but this time I went to another store and bought their cheapest tires without warranty because even if they dint wear as well I can still afford to just replace them and have new tires more often."
3,"Great place for coffee and good studying!! Or the other way around? Whichever. \n\nAnyway the coffee is great, I always get the Cafe Caramel in a To-Go cup since it gets cold faster with the indoor mug. The taste is always good, sometimes a little strong, but nothing a little sugar couldn't fix. \n\nThe environment varies ... sometimes it's nice, and sometime's it's not; it depends on the crowd. \n\nI had one occasion where some Asian girl was sitting in front of me and kept talking to herself ... which was uhh hella weird. Another instance had some girl in basically tight boxershorts showing off cellulite to the world like there's no tomorrow. And the most unforgettable one was where the place was packed and some smelly ass guy sat next to me. I had to get 2 hours of studying done to prepare for the next day and I couldn't move and this guy just killed my night ... \n\nAs far as customer service, it's fair. You order up front, wait a couple of minutes, get your drink and study the night away.\n\nNot the best cafe, but I return here frequently to get studying/work done. I would recommend this place to others."
3,"I've always had fun at this downtown dive bar.  They have such a wide range of music and events.  This past Friday they had an awesome jam band with \""Fear and Loathing\"" showing on a movie screen in the background.  Had to wait awhile for drinks but it was no big deal.  We were able to get a table.  It was VERY loud, especially when the band stopped and the DJ started.  $5 cover.\n\nPast cool events have included blues night, psy trance and breakbeats.  Funny wild west cowboy decor inside... but it works.  They also have a parking lot right across the street, which is nice since it's a somewhat sketchy area of downtown."
0,"Well, im a mexican chick and im a sucker for mexican food so i decided to give this place a try. It was a thursday, and yes it was crowded for dinner. \nThe Atmosphere looks so cool, and the music if you're a latino its just awesome. It can get a little bit too load in the evening and sometimes it bothers if you're eating and want to talk to your friends.\n\nI order the carne asada, my sister the tamal with beans and rice and my mother\nsome shrimp tacos. This was the worst mexican food i have ever tried in my whole\nlife. It tasted like microwave american mexican food.You know it had \""that flavor\""\nthat superficial flavor you get when you buy frozen microwave food. Even Taco\nBell its way better than this place,and hell yeah,i hate taco bell.\n\nI asked the waitress to call the manager. I told the manager i didn't like the food at all. The whole 3 dishes tasted terrible,and i even told him this wasn't legitimate\nmexican food,and guess what he said: This is Texas Food not mexican. This \nrestaurant its from Texas.....Omg! This its the most ignorant manager ever. Cabo\nWabo its named from Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Not Texas,Come on people,read a little....\n\nI had to donate $80 dlls for food i didn't eat, plus $20 dlls for some pictures they took. I bought them because we looked nice...."
0,Came to Marquee for the first time with my girlfriends to celebrate my frends return from the navy and did not expect such rude and unnecessary behavior from their bouncers.\n\nWe were on guestlist and waited over 3 hrs for any response but was rudely ignored even though we went up to them asking about the current status. When we were finally able to get one of their attentions they said itd be 20-30 more minutes after 30 min he says that the line is on hold and cant do anything about it. But he continued to let random people who werent in line through.\n\nI do not expect to ever stay at the Marquee after such an experience and you shouldnt either.
4,"Excellent place.  I admit, I came here for the name - I loved the name and then viewed the menu and it was clear I was going to be a guest here prior to me leaving Vegas.  It's a great atmosphere smart casual and the service is quite lovely.  Very relaxing time with great food and I will certainly return"
3,I have used these folks for three years now. I added another of our properties this year. They make my lawn green and thick with grass.\nThis is something that my brown thumb has never accomplished on my own. A little pricey but well worth the cost.
1,"Yeah, the rocking chairs are a cute touch, but how comfortable do you think they are when you've just flown a red-eye (that was 45 minutes early...thanks a LOT) and have a connecting flight 3 hours later, with the temperature of the place hovering around 45F.   They are not conducive to sleep, happiness or non-terrorist thoughts.\n\nI chose to sleep on the floor...the just shampooed, wet, cold, stinky floor.\n\nI just wanted some sleep, DAMNIT."
0,"\""What do you wanna do tonight, Bren?\""\n\n\""Donna, haven't you heard? The Peach Pit is open at night now.\""\n\n\""Oh yeah, Peach Pit After Dark. Let's go!\""\n\n\""Totes! I hear Dylan is juicing now. He must be huge. I hope he grinds me.\"""
4,"Free attraction that changes with the seasons--can't go wrong! I have seen it at several times throughout the year and always find it \""worth it\"" to park at fight the crowds, even on holidays. Places like the Bellagio Conservatory are really what solidify my feeling that Vegas is Disneyland for adults--it's perfectly groomed and themed, elaborate as all get out. Open 24 hours, too...so it's even better than Disneyland!"
2,"Been here several times for lunch when I lived in the area, great value and not bad. What I didn't like was the Japanese Techno music..would return"
0,"So, it's been a while since I've yelped....due to the busy hectic life I have, but it took this night to bring back my passion for Yelping.  \n\nIt was a Wednesday night, not unlike any other night, but I was craving some wings....not just any wings. I wanted some good looking wings, just like the commercials, and wanted to have the opportunity to try some good tasty menu items that are featured on the website.\n\nOff to wild wings in Steele Creek.....This is relatively new, appears clean and fresh from the outside and it features a nice large covered patio area with some tv's with ample seating.  But this mind you is where the good stuff ends, and the adventure begins. \n\nIt took a few minutes for the hostess to locate a table for us, there were 2 clean tables and six ( yes 6 ) dirty tables that were never bussed or cleaned in the main area toward the entrance or front door.  I mention six tables as they were the same six tables that were never cleaned prior to our departure.\n\nThe service was slow, the atmosphere or environment could have been nice, but regardless where you are .....if you are sitting next to trash and dirty tables, then you may as well be eating next to a landfill, this place was a dive.  Trash on the floor, filthy tables, and did I mention the dirty tables, Geez, the UFC was on, the football game was on, and all I could see was the trash!\n\nSo we ordered drinks and an Appetizer, the hostess was the food runner, and brought the mushrooms after 10 minutes or so.... The wings, well we were going to eat them there, however with all the trash, we chose to have our meals boxed to go since we could not stand the trash.  As I recall, there were no silverware for us to use , and the mushrooms came out in a cardboard type box, so why can't the servers just throw the trash away? \n\nWill I be back, Don't Think so!\n\nJust thought this location needs a boot in the buttocks, as if management noticed this and allowed this location to look like that, then it won't take long before it will become like the Buffalo, Nearing Extinction.\n\nVery Frustrated....should spend less money on advertising and more money on training servers and management."
1,"Overpriced, bland, typical food.  Not bad food, but typical.  But for the price, and the other options available, no reason to come here.  Sorry, Frank.\n\nThe Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy was pretty cool, though...so maybe it get's 2.5 stars."
0,"As most of you can see, my first review was glowing. This review is specifically in regards to the maintenance staff. Specifically a gentleman named \""Jaime\"". \n\nOne week ago my husband and I came home to an AC unit blowing warm air. We called the emergency line, since \""no air conditioner\"" is considered an emergency. The gentleman called back 30 minutes. He stated because it was dark there was nothing he could do until morning. So we shut off the system. toughed it out until morning. The next morning he came in and explained to us it didn't work because it was off. We tried to explain we intentionally turned it off. But when he turned it on the air was reasonably cool so we accepted that answer and chalked it up to our error. \n\nLast night when I got home from work it was 83 in the apartment again. We waited until morning to call because of our experience with being told there was nothing they could do at night. \n\nJaime came this morning, said something about a blown fuse and that it was fixed. When I got home from work again this evening, it was again 82 in the apartment and blowing warm air. \n\nI called emergency maintenance again. This time before dark. 30 minutes later (after dark) Jaime called again telling me he already came and it worked this morning. I explained I appreciated that but it was very hot again and made a point of calling before dark. I asked him at what point do we need to involve a professional? Someone who specializes in air conditioners and he lost his patience with me. Accusing me of calling him unprofessional. I stated I only meant it was obviously more complex than he initially realized. He at that point reminded me he already fixed it and I must be doing something. At that point I asked to speak with his supervisor since we were obviously not communicating correctly. He told me he did not have a supervisor. I then asked who he reports too ... And he said \"" you're going to report me?!?!!\"" And I rephrased again just indicating I wanted to elevate the situation being he was accusing me of not correctly using an air conditioner. At that point he started speaking so quickly I could no longer understand him. I ended the conversation by stating please come as early in the morning as you can since this will be the second night of no sleep due to the uncomfortable temperature. \n\nI hate dragging people through the mud, or naming names specifically in my negative reviews but in the course of a single conversation I was made to feel I was not smart enough to properly operate an air conditioner and I don't understand how apartment management/supervision  works. \n\nThis is unacceptable. He made no efforts to offer assistance in the form of fans/portable air units or vacant apartments. Instead choose to belittle me for inconveniencing him on a Friday night.\n\nI hope that MC properties makes this right because I expect much much more from such a large property management company.\n\nUpdate? He had to call a professional. Thank you very much."
1,"Sushi was ok at best and plates were not clean. A fly landed in my water...Wait staff was marginal at best, staff was hailed multiple times. \n\nNot authentic Japanese food\n\nProceed with caution"
0,Simply the worst cheeseburger I have ever been served by wait staff.  Service was poor and the surroundings looked worn and questionable.  \n\nI have eaten at their Maui location and enjoyed it.  This place needs to be closed.
1,"1 1/2 stars, Dunkin Donuts donut's are gross. They are dry. Sometime they are good..but not usually. If you want good donuts go to Krispy Kreme. You'll be satisfied. :)"
1,"This hotel is horrible u get what you pay for. The reason why I stayed here is because of a festival I came with a group of friends. This hotel is old , the restrooms ohhhh lord they are very small. Also if you want to take a cab it takes forever. This hotel is sad. If ur on a budget this hotel is cheap but expect the worst."
2,"Great tasting lamb gyros, good service and reasonable price. What else could someone ask for in a mall? If you're looking for something different, tasty and quick give them a try."
2,Great ice- cream great service; they let is sample everything until I settled for the cocoanut 7 layer bar on the biggest cone they have. Best ice-cream I had in a long time. My daughters loved it! Just wish they had pistachio flavor had to settle for the half pint from the freezer.
1,"I won't write much about this; I'll just keep it brief.\nThere was a good selection for the price, but the quality of the food wasn't really good. \nThe staff did a good job though.\nI'd say that, being the same price as Luxor's, I 'd recommend going to Luxor because even though there was a smaller selection and Luxor, the food was still a little bit better."
3,"I know that I shouldn't review a hair salon until I've been twice, or at least until I've had time to let my new 'do sink in.... but I'm just so super excited about this salon!! I'm giving it a conservative 4 stars (b/c of the aforementioned reasons.)  \n\nIn a bit of synchronicity, I met Hillary of the eponymous salon at Bar & Bistro just as my old stylist was preparing to leave town.  So, after tracking down the salon based on a few hazy memories, I made an appointment, and she was able to fit me on the schedule the same week that I called.  Yay! \n\nThis is a single-chair salon, so when you make an appointment, you will get Hillary, and you will be the only client there. (Yay!)\n\nI arrived a few minutes late because I am directionally challenged, even though the salon is literally but a few meters from 3 other businesses at the Arts Factory that I patronize regularly. (It is upstairs, use the set of stairs closest to the bathrooms.)  \n\nLet's cut to the chase: you can drink while you get your hair did.  Hil's business manager escorted me to the bar, and got me set up with my first of two sangrias (I went on Thurs, when B&B has 1/2 price happy hour, score!). By the time we returned, she ushered me in to the adorably appointed salon to begin my hair transformation.  I usually like to let a stylist make suggestions and do what they will with my hair (color and cut), and she did a great job.  \n\nShe's super fun and friendly, which is important, since my giant mop of hair takes about 3 hours to do.  She also uses cruelty free (not tested on animals) hair products, which makes my vegan heart happy.  The service was very reasonably priced.  \n\nSummary: personal attention, good hair, fun, moderately priced, booze."
2,Good burgers. Lots of different shakes and burgers. Burped it all though.
3,"I order Glass Nickel occasionally and generally go for their Santa Fe or Mediterranean.  This review has to do with this evening's order, though.\n\nI went for spaghetti with pesto, which comes with a side salad and garlic bread.  I also ordered garlic bread sticks.  All of this was for delivery.\n\nI placed my order at about 7:15 and by 8:30 was still waiting for it to come (estimated delivery time is usually between 45 minutes and an hour).  I was very close to calling in to the restaurant to find out what happened to the driver when he showed up.  \n\nThe first thing out of his mouth was an apology.  He apologized about the delay, which he blamed on the bad weather as well as its being a busy night, and offered me $5 (almost half the cost of my order) back on my order as compensation.  I took it and remembered to tip.\n\nThe food was average, though I am a sucker for the garlic bread sticks."
4,We saw Gilbert Gottfried at the Shimmer Showroom at the Hilton.  Very small venue which was very nice.  I loved the show and the experience.  We bought his dvd and he signed the front of the case.  Gilbert let us take pictures.  I enjoyed the show along with the hospitality of the staff and Mr. Gottfried.
2,"Heard a lot of good things about Raising Cane's but overall I was disappointed.  The chicken strips were good and the coleslaw was tasty, I didn't care for Cane Sauce - Mayo, ketchup, and paprika..too heavy and just not for me.  I also thought the toast was a bit soggy and the crinkle cut fries were limp.\n\nThe things I do like about Cane;s don't have much to do with the food, the restaurant is named after the owner's dog and they support local animal welfare groups. They also support education and hunger programs and a variety of other community initiatives.\n\nI will return for the chicken strips because they are very good, I'll just skip the sauce and take them home and dip them in a sauce I like."
0,"My husband and I went in today to get pedicures. It was a last minute thing and figured we would go here since we were already there. While there we received horrible service. The ladies were talking about my husband, they upgraded our pedicures to a more expensive one without telling us, and they did not do what I had asked them to do with my nails. I asked to have a gold flower design on my big toe. The lady didn't do so then threw a fit when I questioned her about it and still didn't do the design. She didn't even get all the dead skin off of my feet so I have to go get another pedicure because she did such a rush job on my feet. My husbands feet look as if nothing was even done to them. When we paid the lady told us the total. When I questioned it about being more she told us we had been upgraded to different pedicure that cost more. I asked her what was different between the two and there was nothing different other than the lotion that was used. Then because I was pissed off that we were charged more than quoted for a less than superior job I did not leave tips. Everyone in there began yelling \""NO TIP!!\"" over and over as if trying to embarrass me into leaving a tip. Their tactics did not work and only embarrassed themselves as we walked out a group of ladies were walking in and asked us what the yelling was about. I told them and they said that they would rather take their business else where and walked off. The ladies inside began screaming even louder than before when they saw the groups of ladies walking away. Needless to say I will NEVER return here and I will tell others to stay away as well! It's pretty ridiculous when they start demanding a tip and treating their customers like crap! If I knew that we could call and complain I would..unfortunately I know nothing will be done since the manager/owner was in the salon when this all went down!! Next time I will check out the reviews before going to get a pedicure last minute!!!"
2,"I haven't had this place on my radar, but had heard about them in the past. I am not a huge fan of food trucks, as I often find them to be overpriced and much more trouble than they are worth. That being said, when they are accessible just as I get hungry, it's hard not to take that as a sign from the Yelp gods to try out a new lunch spot. \n\nI had scouted out their menu a few days in advance knowing they were going to be in my neck of the woods and was a little disappointed to find out that they weren't offering their full menu and were instead offering just two lunch items. These were the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich. I almost always order the pulled pork at BBQ joints, but I dared to be different this time and went with the brisket and made it a combo by adding their mac n cheese. \n\nThe wait wasn't too long. I guess that was the method to their madness for only offering two options. It was a drizzly day, so once I had my food I quickly ran inside to enjoy my lunch. \n\nThe meat was tasty, nothing amazing and could definitely have been enhanced by a tad more BBQ sauce. It was also a little on the fatty side, which I didn't mind too much, since most brisket I have tried ends up being to dry. The sandwich was topped by coleslaw, which definitely enhanced the flavors. The mac n cheese was good. Not the best I've had, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again if they're in the area. \n\nOverall, I wasn't blown away and I don't see myself going out of my way to try them again."
3,"I was very happy with my experience with Budget, especially after my awful experience with Avis a few months ago at CLT. I was actually able to pick up the car at their Winston-Salem location and drop it off at Charlotte Airport without a single additional fee or hassle. Booking online was incredibly easy and the check-in woman at CLT really made the whole experience a bit better since she was so friendly.\n\nIf you are in need of a car in Winston-Salem or Charlotte I definitely recommend using Budget!"
1,"Is this a daycare or car rental service? I dropped a friend off who received awful directions from staff on how to get here. When we arrived, I could see why. The place was swarming with children belonging to BOTH staff members and appointments were continually interrupted by screams in the back and interruptions for mommy.  Not very professional."
2,"First let me saw we are owners here of not 1 but 2 timeshares.  We love the rooms, decor and staff but this place is sadly going down hill. The last 2 times there has been mild in the shower and a few other things that just made it seem crummy. Mold takes time to build its not over night so thats just nasty and dirty! Never order from Scotty Beans (their room service) unless you want cold greasy food and not the good kind of greasy.  The only reason im giving it 3 stars is for the decor and jacuzzi bathtub but I do clean it myself first. Be warned and make sure its clean!"
1,"I was very excited about Le Cirque and it turned out to be a disappointment. While the service was good, I thought the food could be improved. I found it to be too rich. What I was most impressed with were the plates themselves. They were very nice plates and probably some of the best I've ever eaten on."
3,"I was not disappointed by my trip here, even after the stunning review from several of my friends. \n\nThe Good: Price-wise this was one of the best options I've ever seen for sushi. Items are served via conveyor belt (if you're sitting at the bar) and plates are color-coded to indicate price. With the plates ranging between $1-$2 each, this is definitely a great bang-for-your-buck restaurant. Between 4 diners we came away with PLENTY of sushi for $10/head.\n\nThe Bad: The selection of sushi is certainly far from the largest I've ever seen. Should you be wanting a wide sampling of the cuisine of Japan, this is no the place to go. None of the sushi was gourmet-level, but everything I had was delicious.\n\nI'd highly recommend Teharu to anyone who wants to sample various sushi without comitting to $7-$10 per item. This is also quite the novel change of pace for sushi afficianados looking for a very different serving style."
3,"We've been meaning to go here for a while and finally stopped in for dinner.  We had a very nice experience: great food, very good service and quite reasonable prices.  \n\nFor some reason, I had been under the impression that this was an expensive restaurant and it's not at all.  Portions are ginormous.  We shared a Tahdig and a single entree of lamb shank (which included 2 enormous lamb shanks for $20) and we took half of our food home, all for less than 50 bucks with a tip.\n\nHighly recommended."
3,"This show is extremely funny and keeps you on your toes, especially if you are in the first few rows. I love how it is interactive. Everyone in this production is super talented. Awesome music, awesome visuals, awesome comedy.\n\nMy favorite part was the whole animation scene, so keep a look out for it. I LOVED IT!!! \n\nI would suggest anyone to see it. It is definitely different, so keep an open mind."
4,"I have never been to the Palms before, but certainly N9ne provides an amazing reason to come back!\n\nIt was highly recommended for steak and I can certainly see why. I chose this to ring in my 2 year wedding anniversary along with my wife and we couldn't stop talking about the food even hours after we had left!\n\nOur reservation was right at 5:30 so for a good chunk of time it was just the two of us (which was kind of nice) and unfortunately we did end up sitting next to a group who was a little bit louder then I had wished, but tuning them out wasn't too difficult in the end!\n\nWe both chose the filet mignon and shared the lobster mashed potatoes. Every bite was truly OUT OF THIS WORLD! The steak itself was extremely tender it literally was pulling away with little effort from the machete steak knife provided. The sauce on the lobster mashed potatoes was heaven and certainly lifted the potatoes to a new level.\n\nThe staff was very inviting and the service left us feeling like we were fancy schmancy (if even for 1 meal). The bill was a little out of my norm, but then again it certainly was well worth every \""penny\"" spent. If you aren't there enjoy being square!"
0,"OK - here's my bias on this: I'm not a gambler. I started to go out and gamble one night but fell asleep reading my kid Winnie the Pooh at bedtime and never made it. So right there you know if our perspectives mesh.\n\nBooked this hotel because I read it was family/kid friendly and still on the Strip (plus it was cheap) and figured we'd give it a spin. Consider it spun. \n\nThe positive: it does seem to be fairly kid friendly for a Strip motel.\n\nWhat's that you say? Like saying fairly lung friendly for a non-filter cigarette? Yes, you have a point.\n\nAlso, it's fairly inexpensive. I can't think of one that was less. \n\nLastly location, location, location. Good location. oh, ok - and the check in lady was nice.\n\nNow for what I really think when I'm not trying to be mature:\n\n1) I' incensed over the $5.99 transaction fee at the ATM.\n2) Yes, you can print your boarding passes. That'll be $7 for ten minutes on the internet please.\n3) room is OK. I've had as good in very small towns in the middle of nowhere.\n4) In the midst of having my four year old on the bridge getting his little brain dazzled by the blinking lights I thought to myself -why am I doing this? He was as happy playing tractors in the room.\n5) how did I just spend $28 at a Baja Fresh in the hotel for a tummy ache? (two - his and mine)\n\nWhich is the point. There are at least a few hotels within a mile of the that do not charge that absurd \""resort fee\"" have a much calmer vibe, better food, a much cleaner pool with less crowding and for less money. Which is what I should have done this time. And will do next time.\n\nExcalibur? Never again."
1,"Being a librarian, I take a critical look at any library that I happen to visit. I've  been using Rainbow, because it's close to my home. After first using the library on W Sahara, this one is shocking. The building \nlooks substantial on the outside, yet inside its overcrowded.  Additionally, whats there is poorly organized. The library is simply too small to house all that a modern, urban library needs. For example, I could not find a place for quiet study, only a table in the midst of everything else. The tutor loudly teaching next to me, made studying or reading impossible.\nI suppose this is all the result of the majority of Nevada and Las Vegas residents being unwilling to adequately finance any type of educational institution."
4,"I base this review SOLELY on their steak and cheese. Get it how you would when you lived back home on the east coast!\n\nIt's delicious, and the best steak and cheese in Vegas. If I lived back home it would be a 4/5 stars.\n\nBe careful and don't belly up and order a large (like I always do!). They will literally hand you a sub that is larger than your arm. I do it all the time and always know that 24\"" sub (or however long it is) is mine when I see them bring it to the counter.\n\nIf you don't like steak and cheese, they have another special sub called the Bobbie. I eat these about 3 times a week during the World Series of Poker when I'm at the Rio everyday (Official Sandwich of the WSOP YO!). Roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce... don't knock it til you try it!"
4,"My Father in sun lakes likes to eat  takeout  an average of once a week from here, we really enjoy the food"
0,"Wow, that sucked.\nIn summary, don't come here if you plan to eat and drink during the movie.\nHowever, I am really hoping this was an off, off, off night. We were the third and fourth people to sit down and order and over an hour and a half later we STILL had not received our food or drink. Hungry? You bet. Annoyed? Heck yeah. When we cancelled our order (the movie was nearly over) they charged us for all of it. A short discussion (with apologetic and polite staff) resolved that and they gave us free passes, but not sure if we'll use them... maybe I'll give them to someone I don't like.\nOther points: Quick ticket purchase, but don't bother coming early, they just line you up in the lobby and make you stand there until a few minutes before the show. The lobby bar staff completely ignores you which just added to the fun of the night. (Vj D.'s review was completely correct.)\nThe picture and sound was fine. If it was a normal movie theater, we'd have been totally happy. But for what they're promoting and marketing, you might as well go to Harkins and sneak in a mini bottle and a snack."
2,"Pretty decent place to grab a burger and  convenient to the shops at the miracle mile and the V theater. Ketchup bar was cool, try the balsamic and sriracha.  The Hun was a bit more than I wanted so I picked it in half but all around cooked to order a yummy burger. Try the blue burger and their grown up milkshakes!"
2,"Let me first start off with the things I like about this place. The food here is good, I wouldn't say it's the best breakfast in town, but it does the trick. I would best compare this to what you make at home, nothing fancy. What brings this place down some is the fact that it is just as good as what you could do at home. The ingredients fall short for me. The bacon and sausage are just okay, nothing special. The service also is just okay, not the friendliest front of house. With all of that mumbo jumbo said, I would say this place is a good place to get a simple fresh meal for a good price. \n\nSide note: You may smell like breakfast after so bring a change of clothes!"
2,"I wanted to like this restaurant, I really did and in all honestly it wasn't their fault.  \nHaving sat on the patio in the direct sun which cooked us at a cool temp of 85 degrees we watched our butter slowly melt, our glasses of chardonnay boil, and out steak and fries turn grossly greasy.  \nMake dinner plans for after the sun goes down and so you can enjoy a romantic view of the Bellagio fountains and chat about the fashion sense of the people walking by.  PS.  Don't forget to order the french onion soup."
1,"Took my wife there for Valentines day, and was fairly disappointed. I have visited other Brazilian steakhouses before so I had an idea of what to expect, unfortunately this place did not meet my expectations.\n\nThe food was fairly good, the bacon wrapped scallops were terrific. They are also attached to an Indian Restaurant, so you are able to sample from the Indian food, which was pretty good.\n\nThe service and selection was the disappointing part. They only brought out like 4 or 5 types of meat to try, and the selection on the hot bar was pretty thin.\n\nNext time I will go to Chima..."
1,"The place is definitely in need of a face-lift.  The spa had missing tiles and lots of old gunk.  The women's facilities needed some cleaning up- the showers were pretty filthy- I didn't much feel like I was getting clean.\n\nThe steam room lacked some major steam and there were no ice towels outside of the room to cool you off while you were in there (something that I think is essential).  \n\nOutside, the pool is nice- but requires more pool chairs.  I ended up having to use one in the back corner under a palm tree- which while shaded and nice, had a fair share of bird poop on it :(\n\nMy massage was nice- no complaints there although the quiet room where you wait for your service was quite a few levels above quiet but that's due to how busy the place was on a Sunday afternoon- lots of chatty women.  Also, the iced tea may have been the culprit for my food poisoning that I experienced a few hours after leaving.\n\nI will probably not be going back to this spa- there are too many amazing options in the area to give this place another shot.  \n\nP.S. Another big bone to pick with the whole experience- when I first got there and checked in they told me how much gratuity was and charge it up front.  $30!!  I was not pleased with that at all."
1,"The Skinny: picturesque ambience makes for a nice relaxing morning but the food definitely had some hits and misses(2) Service: efficient as always (4), value: given the tableside service for some items with buffet-styled appys, grilled foods and desserts, you can probably find a better deal at a buffet for $59/person (price includes live entertainment tax, juices and sodas). (2).\n\nMy hubby's been dying to try this place out for a while so we decided to give it a try. The old school Country Club air can't be beat as the restaurant overlooks the beautifully manicured 18 holed grass golf course. A live band serenades you as you marvel at this green oasis. Service is quiet and efficient which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, the food just doesn't match up to the promise of its ambience and staff. There are two distinct components: the tableside menu (unlimited ordering) which is prepared a la minute, and the buffet consisting of grilled, cold and dessert items.\n\nI asked the hubby what his favourite thing on the cold buffet table. He said that it was the peppercorn encrusted goat cheese with a side of the candied pecans. 'Nuff said when the best thing on the buffet is something that require little to no preparation. (FYI - they did have a plentiful cold seafood bar with fresh oysters, smoked fish, crab and ceviche. That being said, the hubs and I tend to be leery of seafood that's been sitting on a buffet table). We did try the corn chowder but found it too cloyingly sweet.\n\nThe grill offered many options including brined pork (pretty tasty), shrimp with chipotle sauce (also pretty tasty), roasted corn (tasted the same as the succotash), roasted potatoes (okay), ancho-chile encrusted turkey (dry as hell)and filet of beef (chewier than jerky).\n\nWe did sample some of the kiddie table items and they were decidedly mediocre. The slider was overly dry while the mac n' cheese was overly watery. (FYI - no fries or potato chips to go with the slider makes this a bit of a bleh! I imagine for the younger set.)\n\nLoving pastries, I opted instead for the carb heavy items. Although the croissant was flaky, the danishes pastry did not hold up to the fruit filling. The little muffins were overly dry and unappetizing. The granola lost it's satisfying crunch after sitting too long in the yogurt/berry parfait. Major fail for a continental breakfast fiend like me.\n\nTableside, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork eggs benny, the French Toast Bread pudding, Chicken Paillard, Grilled Hot Dog with a side of corn succotash. \n\nThe best was the BBQ pork eggs benny - it was literally a messy mouthful of guilty pleasure. Imagine a bacon-onion-cheese biscuit topped with BBQ pulled pork and poached egg. Then top it off with a playful chipotle hollandaise. It was pretty good but sadly the only thing we wanted to finish. All the other items were nothing we would return for sadly (corn succotash = so-so flavours with too much cream, french toast bread pudding = overly dense textural nightmare, chicken paillard = bland, grilled hot dog = dehydrated weenie with no snap and an overly large bun).\n\nThe nail on the coffin was the dessert table. Of all the desserts, I only wanted a second bite of the La Reve cake - a lovely concoction of chocolate ganache and praline crisp on the bottom. The opera cake was okay. The macaroons, the coconut cream pie, the chocolate eclair...they all had some textural issues especially with the marshmallow topping on the pie.\n\nIf you consider the AYCE tableside service, this place is a great deal. However given the hit-or-miss quality of the food you're given, it just doesn't quite live up to expectations. A 2.5 -starred review."
4,"Pork belly (no Trading Places jokes, please), gnocci, blood sausage, wine. Kronenbourg, good friends, and Las Vegas. An amazing experience I will not soon forget, and everything was perfect."
4,"A top notch restaurant. It's worth it to go just for the frites. It has a nice ambiance, but it can be difficult to get a table.\n\nThe Sunday brunch is also really good, they make a great eggs benedict."
0,Not impressed at all
2,"Hmmmm... I'm not sure which box to check... 3 or 4... 3 or 4... I'm going to go with a 3, but I am certain that a second go-around would leave me with a 4 impression.\n\nThe service was definitely 5 stars, except for the reco by my server to add Swiss cheese to my egg white omelet. Egg whites = bland. Swiss Cheese = pungent. Some may say a good dichotomy, but I disagree. I will say that my dining partner delighted in the wild mushroom and herb eggs and strawberry lemonade. \n\nI had to use the bathroom, which happens to be located out around the back. Think any one of the \""____bertos\"" Mexican places, and you will pick up what I am laying down. However, I was surprised at the cleanliness despite the fact that I had to use the men's restroom because the W's was occupied. \n\nOverall, the place is cute. Quite cute. However, because cute generally infers small, I was left smelling like sizzling bacon all day. Now, to some that would be a good thing, but being a vegetarian, I am not overly partial to the smell of fried pork flesh. But I digress."
2,On the woman's side of the spa the attendants  were lacking and food and drink service was near non existent. They have no cafe or assigned pool waitress. If you want great service see Eugene and he will make sure you are taken care of.
3,"Nice place to stop and relax.  Andre and the staff are so friendly.  Even played checkers with me and kicked my bottommmmm.   There is a table to play checkers or chess if you are in the mood.\n\nHad a very good lunch, cup of wedding soup and turkey sandwich.   Have some nice deserts but did not have one today."
1,"I love creole, I know creole, I cook creole myself.\n\nSo I was beyond excited to try this place, and thrilled to see this style of cooking introduced to Pittsburgh. \n\nIt didn't stand up to my standards, I guess if you don't know creole food it can pass for a poor imitation.\n\nIt simply lacked heart, which for me, is everything with this style of cuisine.\n\nI found the atmosphere tacky and cliche.\n\nOur server was well-trained, but again lacked heart and personality.\n\nAn overall corporate feel, when to do a true cajun/creole menu you need soul."
2,The prices are a little high but you do get large portions \nGreat atmosphere and good beer\nThe potato salad was awesome \nMy jagersnitzel was a bit tough but full of flavor\nSpaetzel was very good\nThe large pretzel was not as hot as I would like but the mustards were yummy \nWe did not really like the whipped cheese spread had a off taste\nAll in all I would say  give it a try
0,Service was the worst. Food was ok but it took at least an hour to get to our table! So I asked them to box it! Bad experience and will never come again.
3,Love love triple love the foie gras bread pudding!  Jeffrey the bartender mixes a mean cocktail.
0,"I went a few weeks ago and the water in my bathroom quit running at midnight and when I called downstairs I was transferred and then no one was sent to my room. It was out for six hours. When I had gone down to the front desk to explain that not only had my water been off but I found hair in my bed and the trash was emptied when we got there, the man didnt make eye contact, grumbled that he was sorry for the incovinience and that he would take the $24 resort fee off. Oh and then when I emailed to complain they sent me an email back saying my next trip will be guaranteed the lowest price...Ugh priceline does that.\nHorrible place. Many of the front desk workers hate being there and you can tell. If you're not going to spend the money to be in a penthouse don't waste your time here they treat you like $h!t otherwise."
4,"So delicious!\n\nThe wait staff there is very knowledgeable about the food and the cooking process and you get five star service.  \n\nThis place is a dream for foodies.  Seriously, if you are a foodie and you don't go here while in Vegas you are missing out.\n\nIts fairly expensive but definitely worth the experience.  The food is really a work of art and so delicious."
4,Food was amazing but what was even better was the service! Our server was Donna and she was great !
0,"So very disappointing!  From the Edamame to the Spicy Tuna Roll! We went for Happy Hour and ordered 5 different orders of sushi, edamame, gyoza, calamari tempura & seaweed salad, every single item tasted the same with the exception of the seaweek salad, that was so overpowering with dressing that it was inedible. Can you believe no pomegrante martini? Seriously? Place was empty which should have told us something. Couldn't find the entrance, front door blends right into the building, seriously! Had to cut through an opening in the gate to try and get into the restaurant, which was pretty much what was happening with everyone else that tried to get in...Just ridiculous.  Bye bye Stingray, will be heading back across the street to Ra where sushi is superb!"
3,Great Mexican food for the price. Esteban is a very courteous waiter. The gringo dip is a frat choice for an appetizer.
4,Our regular theatre.  Always clean and comfortable.  Saw The Giver today and were 2 or 4 viewers!  The staff is always helpful and nice.  We appreciate the location and typically plenty of parking.  We always have our souvenir cup to get a reasonable soda.
1,"Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!!\nThe Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!"
3,"Javier and I went here on Saturday night. The good thing about this place is happy hour starts at 4pm and ends when the place closes. Good thing for you beer drinkers, they are super cheap. We shared all of our food that night. We started off with the ninja roll, this consists of crab and spicy tuna stuffed into a jalapeno topped with some eel sauce. This was our favorite!!!! We also had the pink lady and the scorpion. I love the inventive names of the rolls and the pink lady also had pink soy paper. Pink Lady, cucumber, avocado,Spicy crab, & Crunch Wrapped in soypaper w/ eel sauce & Spicy Mayo and Scorpion Roll, Shrimp tempura & cream cheese topped w/ kani, masago, eel sauce, & spicy mayo. We then shared the chicken hibachi meal for 10.99, consists of rice chicken and veggies and miso soup. This was horrible. there was too much sauce drenched on chicken and veggies. The miso soup made me want to gag. Rice was nothing special, just white rice also came with an orange that was tart. The four stars is based on the sushi here. DO NOT EAT THE REGULAR FOOD .  But sushi is terrific"
1,"Once again come on Guy you must be eating different food then they serve me... I have given Joe's farm grill two try's now and not impressed with the long lines to everything there... Frist visit ordered the same meal guy did Ahi Tuna Sandwich (Grilled rare, wasabi mayo Asian slaw with fries I also bought a order of onions rings... Well I was waiting I was so lucky to watch a loop of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives of Joes's Farm Grill on tvs they have there... My number is called and I get my food from the window the ahi is not rare at all so over cooked the oinion rings are so greasy and are not good this guy bummed... Second trip I have to wait 20 people deep out the door for lunch I order the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger (6oz, thick cut apple wood smoked bacon, blue cheese, hand breaded onion rings and Joe's real BBQ sauce... Once again it was not this meal that I was hoping for it was just ok really greasy and filling not my kind of meal... I will go back one more time in hopes that the 3rd will be the charm."
0,"If you are craving pizza that tastes like it as actually from New York forget this place. Not even close. It should be considered false advertising to include \""New York\"" in your name. It implies the food is similar to food you would find there. This place would not last a week if it was in New York. That should tell you something!"
0,"Unfortunately, I don't have a good thing to share regarding the practice of Sundin & Fish.  As a new business owner with little to no tax knowledge, I trusted the practice to guide me.  Let's face it, from the outside, this firm is very regal and appears to be the end all be all for accounting firms.  The first year the firm did our taxes, it was easy and painless.  The moment I started asking for help or asking questions I would receive, that will cost you $120+ per hour, we don't give info over the phone and I'd get referred to some website to search for an answer.  After paying hundreds of dollars for completed returns, an SCorp filing and a DBA filing and not knowing how to move forward, I called.  Once again, I was told it was a fee to talk to them.  The receptionist Jeanie, along with both Fish brothers, speak down to their customers-they have little to no respect and are completely unwilling to help-even after spending HUNDREDS of dollars for their services.  It's as if they expect you to know how to do their job and get annoyed and frustrated when you don't know tax.  I've NEVER received such horrific service from what appeared to be a reputable company.  I'm at year end, didn't pull a salary, never was explained what needed to happen and I'm needing to have a salary shown NOW.  Well, isn't that great...there goes my income for the rest of the year because the estimates they provided were far from accurate.  I've sought out someone new for my taxes and have since learned that the little I was guided to do was very shady and unethical."
4,"Guys - if you gotta hit the mall with your woman ...this is the place to go ...the most comfortable chairs to lounge in while your girl looks at overpriced, shoes, handbags, clothes, etc - grabbed a cup of java, plopped in a chair, did the \"" i'm cool texting \"" thing  and the mall was ...tolerable ...then again , it helped that we got their late and the mall shops were closing within an hour ...oh....darn !"
0,"I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a \""little extra protein\"" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of \""protein\"" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered \""2 free cookies\"". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!"
1,"I am a neighborhood local, and regretfully cave in to going to Copper Star to get coffee when Im too lazy to make it myself.  \n\nProduct: EVERYTIME i order their drip coffee, I immediately regret it.  Burnt, gritty, and occasionally tastes like it was reheated leftovers from the day before.  \""Iced Coffee\"" at Copper Star consists of ACTUAL leftover coffee...  instead of tossing the leftover coffee when it's time to make a fresh pot, the coffee is put into metal containers and submerged in cold water and put in the refrigerator, then served  to customers the next day.  If you have in-house pastry people and a staff who has a clue what they're doing (too much to ask...?) i would expect fresh strong-brew that is immediately chilled, or for the progressive local spot, a proper overnight cold-brew.  No organic or fair trade coffee is advertised or offered, and no one has ever been able to tell me where it comes from.  \nI give this review 2 stars because they have great bagels.  From somewhere else.  How do you screw up bagels? They don't.  Thank you for putting my butter or cream cheese on yourself while my bagel is still warm.  This is what keeps me coming back...lol  However, they are regularly out of bagels by 9am.  Perhaps ordering more would solve this problem?  Or would that just be common sense?\nAs I sit here today eating my bagel replacement (a Banana Nut Muffin), I was compelled to write this review when I discovered half of the browned banana in the bottom of my muffin.  The last one i had about a month ago had a small piece, so it didn't phase me.  I considered if the muffin was meant to have half a banana in the bottom, but then I'd never had one like that, and i certainly take the extra effort when making my own banana bread to carefully smash the banana before i add it to my batter BEFORE baking!\n\nStaff:  If someone frequents a place at least once a week, they would expect some level of recognition, particularly if they are unique looking or have enigmatic personality.  I consider myself VERY unique looking.  The same staff looks at me like I have a second head growing outta my shoulders, or they seem dazed and robotic, with a Stepford Wife unprompted expectation of an order to be rattled off without greeting.  My mate used to work there, and no one seems to every recognize them, either.  I think it's weird.  \nSpeaking of weird, let's chat about Bill.  There is another blocked review referring him: \""The owner (who I have met about 8 times now-- his name is 'Bill') is completely used-car sleazy and gives me the closeted creeper horrors. I sat at the bar for about a month working on my computer-- listening to how he talks to his mainly young-lady employees. His tone and the things he says range from offensive to condescending and inappropriate. Funny thing about having a completely open workspace-- the customers can hear everything you say...\""\nI have the same experience with him and have been appalled at the blatant sex-oriented comments said in full company of customers...  I wonder what Bill's wife thinks of his ladies at the the coffee shop.  \n\nCustomer service starts with a smile, and listening skills.  If you would be busy LISTENING to what i want, instead of busy cutting me off with \""is that all...?\"" you might actually get my order right, thus getting me out of your line and out of your life in the fasted way possible, which is clearly the intention of the bitchy girls who work there.  \n\nIn short~\nLocal businesses fail because they don't appreciate the people supporting them.  \nBill's favorites get away with murder and treat everyone like lesser folk.  \nNot every idea is a good one, especially ones regarding serving old coffee.\nMash the bananas before adding them to the batter, and order some more friggin' bagels.  \n\nwhy do i continue to come here...?  I'm going to The Refuge next time."
1,"I loooooooove Fuzzy's!!!....until today! I have a huge family. I ordered 8 steak tacos and 8 fish tacos and chips with guacamole. Tyler took my order and refused my military discount, claiming because it was a Tuesday there weren't any extra discounts because Tacos were a $1.50.   Now I have been coming to Fuzzy's every Tuesday since I moved here from Ohio and use my military discount.  I'm familiar with the owner who is a Michigan fan!! He teases my son's for wearing OSU gear!!! Tyler was rude loud and obnoxious, refused to add my discount and shoved my receipt in my face and said \""Look lady I'm not giving you a discount, do you want me to get fired\"" The manager was not there but Westin , I'm assuming was taking the managerial position for the day, stepped in.  He assisted us with a smile, was cordial and added my discount. Meanwhile, Tyler stomped away from the cashier station pouting! Terrible customer service...terrible example of empathy!! Tyler makes Fuzzy a place I never want to come back to!!!  Thank you Westin for all of your help and for keeping Fuzzy's onTuesday regular for us!!!"
1,"I am so very much for small business. Especially small minority owned businesses in a town where you really are the minority. I want you to win. \n\nThat said, I already have a love-hate relationship with Soul Food. It tastes great, every bite is a a flavorful and savory journey for your tastebuds, but is it good for you? The answer is a resounding NO.  \n\nThis is my point, Soul Food is the worst meal for someone to eat on a regular basis. The reason? SALT, the number one cause of hypertension and the number one (or two depended on who you ask) killer of the Africanus-Americanis nationwide. \n\nSoul food should only be eaten in moderation, if ever. So if that's the case and I'm going to willingly take years off of my life then the food needs to be good. Damn good. Like sell my soul to the Devil good. Unfortunately, Roxanne's was anything but good. \n\nThanks to my girlfriend and her relentless craving for fried chicken and macaroni and cheese, we wind up looking up this place on a Friday evening. I dial the place up and talk to a pleasant enough woman who said she was closing soon she but put my order in. I ask her the menu choices, because apparently the menu changes everyday. My sweetie ordered some baked chicken wings with a side of mac and some green beans and since pretty much everything else was cooked in pork fat or turkey, I opted for Tilapia and a double side of mac and cheese, really because that's all that's available...allegedly. \n\nWe drive up to the restaurant, a small store front, tucked into a crevice on Main, next to a barbershop, we almost missed it.  I applauded its quaint charm, until I stepped inside. \n\nThe same woman who took my order was both the cook and taking phone and walk-in orders, meaning we had to wait a bit to ask any questions about the food. I'm not really into Tilapia, its a shitty farm raised fish of questionable quality, but according to the woman on the phone it was the only fish they had at the time...or so she said. \n\nWhen we got there we see a whole menu of items which she did not say were available, one being salmon which would of been my go to choice, but since I called in the Tilapia I was stuck with it. Fine, I was a little pissed but I went with it, supporting small business and all. \n\nNow I'm quite the stickler on how my food is prepared and what it contains and I get it, its not a fancy spot but I was turned off by how the food was cooked. No gloves being used or hairnets while the cook was handling the phone, then going to the cash register, handling money, the phone only to go back to cooking. \n\nWe finally get our food, in styrofoam (another pet peeve) I pay and as I hand back the receipt, I get some request for us to \""check in on Facebook.\"" and a not really sincere but more of a \""fuck you, go away, goodbye\"" attitude with corresponding laughter to a cohort (who should of been back there helping instead of cackling in the front) which immediately made me feel like I was being hoodwinked. \n\n\""Don't worry I won't be back.\"" I muttered to myself while leaving, I get home and open my container of food to validate my concerns and Viola! Much to my surprise (THIS IS SARCASM), the food sucked. Everything was too salty, everything, the fish, the macaroni, the green beans. How could someone eat this on the regular and not eventually die of a stroke. \n\nLike I said earlier, if your going to sell high blood pressure and diabetes to people in the form of food at least make it consistently good and don't have an attitude when people come to give yo money. I could of made everything at home and it would of tasted much better and would of been way healthier with the same 20 dollars I spent. \n\nMessage: Just because you are Black and full of sass does not mean your candied yams are any damn good."
3,First time I ever flew on US Airways! I enjoyed my trip from DFW to here. US Airways are another one on my list to travel on the airways. Another great thing I will say is that when my wife and I were on our way back to DFW our flight was delayed in Savannah and we barely made it to next flight. Needless to say they just closed the gate but the staff let us on board since there were at 10 others that were in the same situation. I really appreciate the customer service. Our luggage was late coming in but it was not lost. They put it on the next available flight for us.
2,"My My...There are some serious haters of this place. I'm glad that I didn't read Yelp before going. I actually went because two people in my office raved about it. I went there on two different occasions to buy gift cards for birthdays. I finally decided to go with friends. I've only been to one other Mongolian grill place so there isn't a lot to compare. All that I can say is that the service was mediocre and not terrible. The food was good. I like the concept of making your own meal with ingredients that you like.  My partner didn't follow instructions and put the sauce in his food bowl instead of the side bowl. They made him go back and put more sauce in the side bowl. Ultimately what happened was an inedible bowl. None of us can figure out why they made him add more sauce. It was too much sauce and not good. Three of us; however, enjoyed our meal. I didn't know that this place is a chain. Oh well...I'll go back because I enjoyed it. I'm not sure that my partner will though. The idea of the sauce makes him queasy,"
3,"You guys...oh no, but I think this place was bought out! I walked by and saw a sign about ANOTHER waffle place coming soon. Ugh.\n\nThat being said, yeah, I love this place. I am such a fan of the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. God, so good. I can now say that having been to France, this place is pretty legit!\n\nMy only complaint is that I don't really get very full eating here. And it's kind of pricey for not getting you full. But whatever! Delicious. I really hope it's not closed."
2,"Another place in Pittsburgh that I thought I had previously reviewed but somehow missed!\n\nBraddock's Street Side Grill/Bar resides inside the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel - a Marriott property. There is an entrance from both the street and from inside the hotel.\n\nIt's a small bar, but it's a good place to hang out, drink, and grab a bite to eat, assuming you want to eat earlier. They don't serve food here past 10:00 pm or so - which is kind of lame. Because of the nature of the downtown area in which the hotel is located, there are not a lot of residents - so most of the restaurants seem to close early. It's a damn shame too - as this place is missing out on offering more service to both hotel patrons and others in the area.\n\nI stayed at this hotel 3 years ago for 3 days. During that stay, a majorly scary bout of severe weather pounded a large area of the upper midwest, including the Pittsburgh area - with unprecedented thunderstorm activity, flooding, and Tornadoes. Many of the hotel guests gathered in the Bar to drink and watch the Weather Channel and local weather station reports coming in - there were myriad Tornado watches and warnings - some not very far from Pittsburgh.\n\nI pounded a few beers and single malt scotches during that scary period, and ate in the bar every night.\n\nThis last stay this past week - we came in to order food - and were informed that since it was after 10:00 pm - no food was available. I'll say it again - LAME! EPIC FAIL!\n\nI like this little bar - but it's hard for me to give it more than 3 stars due to the food hours..."
0,Horrible experience when I ported my lines over.  Waited 30 minutes to speak to someone when I had an appointment.  I end up being set up with the Assistant Manager which didn't know if I was able to port my number to the Sprint. After I found out I was able to port my tablet to sprint.  While in the store it took 2 and half hours to set up my service. That night I drove to Casa Grande to pick up my daughter and the service kept cutting in and out.  I thought it being almost 2015 and looking at there towers online it showed that sprint had a decent signal by now. That's why I brought my service over to them.  I got home and the service was showing 3G coverage the whole time home. When driving back and forth to   Casa Grande the coverage going in and out of 4g signal throughout my drive home.  Where I live is right across the street from the store which the website and showed 4g coverage.  Sprint did not only tell the true about their signal but the employees when I brought it there attention they tried to charge a restocking  fee to return my device back to the store less than 24 hours from when I started the service. The breakdown to charge me a restocking fee for $35.00 for the phone and $75.00 for activating the IPAD air I bought.  I explained to the sales representative that I would like a full refund.  Before I went back to the store I already ported back my number to AT&T because the phone service does not work as it is supposed to work.  I spoke to the store manager and he said that's fine but we have to charge you that restocking charge.  I didn't even use the service for more then 24 hours and the signal was terrible and the customer service was terrible too.  Letting you know to get your bill cut in half you should stay with Verizon or AT&T it is not worth the time to go to this terrible carrier.  Charge you for fees when you return your equipment for not working and not being honest about the coverage.  I left the store and the store manager left a note on my account that I can't call customer service to return my device.  Never met such inconsiderate jerk that did not understand the situation for the customer.
2,"I used to live right down the street from here and I would stop in to get an iced dirty soy chai on the way to work. They make an amazing one, but it is really expensive for a small drink. Free WiFi is nice."
1,BEST GIMMICK EVER!\n\nThe bar is tiny. The drink is ok. \n\n$25 allows you to experience what it is like inside a freezer.
3,"If you're familiar with Uncle Bears, then you know what to expect here: shelled peanuts, lots of TVs, and license plates and dog photos everywhere. This location is a little bigger than the others I've been to though. \n\nCame here for lunch. It was busy, but not crowded. I was seated promptly and my server took my drink and lunch order quickly. Food came out fast - cooked to order and nice and hot. Server was attentive throughout my meal without being overly so. \n\nBonus points... \n...for having someone who actually paid attention to the games on TV, making sure all TVs had a good assortment of games around the restaurant. I hate it when you go to a sports bar and half the TVs are on infomercials or soap operas and you can't find someone who can operate the remote. \n\nNo concerns about that here."
0,"Hubby ran in for a takeout and the entr\u00e9e was ok...noodles and clams. He ordered a serving of lobster bisque and was disappointed in the quality. He was also overcharged $5.  When he spoke to the manager the next day, the manager admitted he had been overcharged but refused to refund the money...told him he now has a $5 credit to a restaurant that overcharged him and served him subpar food. Well they can keep that fiver and enjoy it because they will not be getting any more of  our money."
0,"Not much has changed.  This place still pretty much sucks.  The only things I like here are the sweet potato tots and the Diet Coke.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL!!!! DO NOT EXPECT ANY ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST BIT IMPORTANT.  YOUR ORDER WILL LIKELY BE WRONG!!!  \n\nMy husband asked for a turkey burger with no garlic whatever sauce on it.  Of course, it came with it on it. They apologized.  Then instead of just making him a new burger, they told us they were just going to throw it back on the grill and that sauce would melt right back off.  ?????  They said it would take about 10 minutes.  WHAT?!?!?  Wouldn't you think the meat would be too tough after 10 extra minutes on the grill?\n\nTo make things worse while we were waiting, some dude (likely the manager) came up to our table and asked if either of us drove a Ford truck.  \""NO, I DRIVE A 7SERIES BMW.  DO I LOOK LIKE A DRIVE A FORD TRUCK?  WHY?\""  He walked away without answering.  It was because a Ford truck was parked in their 15 minute only to go parking spot we figured out.  \n\nSo I had already finished my chicken Caesar salad, no turkey burger for my husband yet. I'm still hungry because my salad was pathetically small for an entree salad and he's starving because he still has no food.  I look back behind me several times trying to spot the waitress to get her attention.  Finally I have to get up and walk to the frick'n hostess stand to order my 1/2 sweet tots 1/2 french fry because she's just standing there talking to the guy who had nothing better to to 10 minutes ago than walk around asking people if they owned Ford trucks. \n\nAnyway, the whole lunch experience took about 2 hours.  TOO LONG.  TOO ANNOYING. WILL NOT BE BACK."
2,"The location is excellent as downtown needed a real supermarket and price-wise it is good. There's lots of great middle-eastern items, prepared foods and a bistro, overall this location is clean, however shelves were not super stocked and it was extremely crowded. I probably would not go out of my way to shop here as most products do not excite me as there are not too many local and organic options, but an Adonis was much needed for the area."
3,"Amazing, tasty bowls of goodness! The prices were excellent for the portion size. Great for any time of day, this soup will put you in a full, healthy mood. Superb balance of soup and meats. Service was quick, but communication was a stretch. I still would go there everyday if I could!"
3,"GAMES..... lots of GAMES.... we played Scrabble.  I won!  Wow!  The Hefeweizen was the BEST I'd ever had... like an orange creamsickle... yum!\n\nThe waitress went all agro on some of my friends who had table service and apparently someone forgot to pay or pay tip.  It was an accident and we were trying to fix it and she was getting like, psycho but acting like she didn't care and it was no big deal.  For that I have to remove a star.\n\nBut I'd go back!"
1,"Certainly had the most ghetto of our Las Vegas experiences here! We did NOT stay at Planet Hollywood, so my review is for the casino and walking thru... (note: I will review Miracle Mile Shops and I will rate much higher for the shops/restaurants!)\n\nWe stayed at the MGM Grand and our first stop along the strip was Planet Hollywood. We walked in and before entering we had observed an ambulance and multiple police cars outside, as well as a couple fire engines. Living in Philadelphia, we thought nothing of it and continued on our way inside. Right in the entrance was a woman-- DEAD. Seriously, she was nothing other than dead. There was a guy with her screaming \""GOD DAMN IT GOD FUCKING DAMN IT\"" and punching the glass (mind you, shattering the glass) of a movie display type of thing. It was chaos. We continued to walk thru to the casino, a little shaken up, but like I said, we're all from Philadelphia. People from Philadelphia will know what I mean. \n\nSo, I do not believe we played anything at this time, but when we went back later in the week, this was the only casino we were in where we were asked if we knew \""where to buy weed\"" or if we \""wanted to buy cocaine.\"" WHAT THE HECK!!!! \n\nI do not think I had a great time while in the casino area and definitely did not hit anything. Though I may return to the casino, I will never stay at PH due to the ridiculousness that some may just consider Vegas......"
4,"A dimly lit sushi joint for the late nights with your friends that like to stuff their faces with oddly named rolls. Let me make it clear right now that, 98% of the time, I will never suggest going out to eat for sushi, but this was a special occasion and my friends chose to have AYCE sushi here on a Friday night.\n\nThe Arrival: The wait wasn't too long at all for my party of eight. Yes, eight! I'm guessing we got very lucky! \""Sweet!\"" I thought. \""Seated so soon? Love this place already.\"" NOTE: I would also like to note that it says they take reservations here on Yelp, but I don't think they do.\n\nThe Folks Running This Place: Everyone was very friendly, but not all of them were knowledgeable of what the menu items were. Some looks were exchanged on the names of certain orders, but that was solved almost immediately. I wouldn't remember all of them either, if I worked there. This would be a good place to add that their menu selection is extensive! So many weird names to remember! I also asked one of the servers for a recommendation, my table loved it and we ended up ordering another.\n\nThe Overall Atmosphere: It'll seem crowded because of the size of the room. People are talking, music is playing, orders are flying out consistently, and the whole place is alive. It's all good.\n\nThe Grub: I'm not a sushi lover, but I enjoyed several of the options here, and am the kind of person who is always willing to try everything. My sushi-loving friends enjoyed their food wholeheartedly ordering one after another. Our empty plates would pile high at the end of the table.\n\n***Here are some menu items we would recommend: seafood tostada, lemon eight roll, ninja roll, mussels, Vegas roll, salmon nigiri and the tuna carpaccio you've probably read about on here about a hundred times is definitely worth a try.\n\nAnyway, they've got my stars. Nothing went wrong, we were treated well, and nearly everything I tried was delicious. And yes, I left full and \""koma\""tose!"
4,"THIS IS ABOUT SERVICE, not sales.\n\nUPDATE: I picked up my car today and they do an excellent job. Yes, waiting for the service guy at the start is a little annoying but they do such a good job, they deserve 5 stars.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI have been to this service department several times with two of my VW's. Generally, the service is quite good. The service reps are friendly and attentive (when you get their attention - see below). I plan to keep returning to them to service my VW.\n\nMy only complaint and the reason I give it four stars is because of the way you make first contact with a service person. You drive up and there are a series of \""booths\"" next to the drive up alley. Almost every time, I have to stand around waiting for someone to come out and start the service process. You pull up, get out of your car and basically stand around  for 5-15 minutes. I understand if the service guys are working with another person but they are often on the phone inside their booth and don't acknowledge you for quite some time. There have been times when one of the guys is in the booth and not on the phone so you end up sliding the door open and doing the \""Excuse me\"" to get attention. Just a little awkward and slow. Be ready to deal with waiting to get some attention.\n\nHowever, once you have their attention, everything tends to go quite well. I have even had a service guy point out something that was wrong that I didn't even notice, then fixed it under warranty.\n\nAs for the people that complain about wait time when you actually choose to wait... I always assume that I might wait beyond the estimated wait time. It seems to be the nature of the business when you go to a dealership for service (as opposed to a \""Jiffy Lube\"" for example). If they say 2 hours, I am usually prepared for 2 1/2 and happily surprised if it's less. Bring something to do though because their waiting room isn't particularly entertaining itself. If I remember correctly, they have free WiFi (don't hold me to that, not sure).\n\nI'll keep going back. I just expect the awkward start to my service experience. No big deal."
2,"Not bad at all... Hyatt Regency is basically a cookie cutter hotel, nothing extravagant or surprising really, but a solid place to stay. We had a king bed that seemed HUMONGOUS, it was wonderful and the room was nice and cool and got completely dark with the blinds closed. While this hotel is more geared towards the traveling businessmen, it was comfortable and after a good meal at The Compass Grill it felt amazing to stumble to our room and crash out in that wonderful bed. While there are some more romantic and elegant hotels around the Valley, if you need to be in Downtown Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency is pretty centralized and a good choice."
1,"It's like a TGIF type deal w/ tasteless generic food w/ some \""islandy\"" decorations. There's no real carribean taste and no dishes that stand out. Two things to try though, are the tostones w/ chicken which is like plaintain nachos, the plaintains are deepfried twice and the blended island margarita."
1,Smaller then I hoped. And really only highlights one artist upstairs and has changing exhibitions down stairs. I like a bit more diversity in my museum experience... I've heard about some great modern artist that are from Glasgow... so where is their work?
2,"Decided to come by here after visiting the record shop nearby as I saw a lot of people dining here. Parking was an absolute hot mess but somehow found a spot in an alley. The place was really loud, had sort of a bar atmosphere. Could see this being a great place to catch a game. They had a happy hour special on shiner bock which was awesome. Service wasn't that slow considering how busy they were. I ended up getting the brisket and when it finally arrived I wasn't too impressed. It was a little overcooked for my taste. Such a disappointment. My date had the cheese fries and they were pretty good. Overall not a bad experience but not a place I foresee myself visiting anytime soon."
4,Every time I come to this restaurant the food is delicious and the service is great. While you wait for your meal they give you the classic Italian bread with butter in basil olive oil. So yummy. They have a filet mignon gnocci that is to die for. I always make sure to stop here whenever I'm in Vegas.
0,"I had heard great things about this sub shop, but honestly Mr. Goodcents subs are far better. The problem is the bread. It was hard, crumbly, not flavorable. The tomatoes were slimmy and on verge of rotten. I was also disappointed only Pepsi products and NO DR PEPPER on the fountain. On the plus side the turkey was high quality and sliced to order."
1,"I love seafood, every kind and every type. My main thing when I come to any buffet is their seafood stuff and quality in meat. I was shocked with how disappointing the seafood and meat was here. The shrimp was random sized, which made some shrimp overly cooked compared to others. None of their fish even tasted like fish. And their meat?? Full of fat and dry when carved for me. This place needs to take a look at their menu and change some things around! For being MGM, I'd expect better. \nI'd say hit up aria, or Cosmo for more bang for your buck."
4,Second visit here and upgrading my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. The food here is ridiculously good. My wife and I were the only non - Indians dining on our second visit. Kinks in the service from the first visit have been worked out. The menu is huge. Ask for advice as necessary.\n\nI am now looking for excuses to go to Concord so I can eat here again. And again.
4,"Do not go here if you are pressed for time, don't like plants, if the weather is hot (like in summer) or you have small children.  Taking that into account, if  you love plants, the weirder, the better, here is a good place to see plants you've never seen before. Don't rush. Take the time to really look at the exhibits. If you're there when the cacti are in bloom, all the better, but they are interesting nevertheless.  Chihuly's glass creations  were interesting, but not, in my mind, the best part of the exhibit. Yet I saw people running from one sculpture to another, taking pictures, and never looking at the plants!  Even when Chihuly's sculputres is gone, there is plenty to see. Too many people just rushed around, never understanding the purpose of a botanical garden is to display plants. Wear a hat and sunblock, even in winter, and bring water with you. You can bet they'll charge you plenty if you buy it from their own vendors."
2,"This place has great prices, nice wine, friendly staff. Prime rib is $15. I think I don't have to go any further here - but in case I do - it is good, it just isn't GREAT.\n\nI would still recommend this place. It is in South Point and considering options and price point, it is a solid choice for dinner. And it tastes good, just don't expect it to be the best you've had."
4,"Love the sand! Very much like a real beach, great for the kids."
1,"The good news is that they have Negra Modelo at 2 for $2.50 at Happy Hour, which has to be some kind of Scottsdale record.\n\nThe bad news is that it's a Mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  Big humongous ones.  Not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. Friendly servers though.\n\nThe food - at least what I had - was barely edible.  Stick to the $1.25 beers."
3,"Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique. \n\nI know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).   \n\nI was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas."
1,"Been here several times and feel it is time for a review. We first came when they just opened with Judd L for some dim-sum desert and pretty much agreed it was a 2-star experience. My last experience made me fed-up and the need to write a review. Each time we come here, service is marginal and I am accustomed to such service during dim-sum. We were rushed to leave to make way for the next set of guests. The dim-sum is about average and typical of what you will find in Vegas.\n\nWhat really disgusted me was that the kitchen staff overloaded the carts by piling dishes of food on top of the food itself! Ewwww......I hope the bottom of the dishes are clean. What I saw was chow-mein on the top level of the cart. They piled additional plates of  a soy based stir-fried rice noodle dish on top of each other. And then while the cart was circulating on the dining floor, a kitchen staff in a chef's hat placed several dishes of Chinese broccoli on top of the second level of rice noodle thus creating 3-levels of food on top of each other in a pyramid fashion! I wished I got a pic of what I saw."
2,"I am not a pancake fan, but I AM a crepe fan...and if you like crepes too, you will LOVE Pamela's hotcakes. They are a little bit thicker than a traditional crepe, but they have those wonderfully crunchy, carmelized edges that take a crepe to the next level of awesome. The strawberry ones with sour cream and brown sugar are insane and quite possibly addictive. I want to try the banana ones sometime too, but I just love the strawberry ones too much!\n\nEverything else I've had here was kinda gross...especially the bacon. Maybe the worst bacon I've ever had. Like, even worse than the bacon at Eat 'n Park. And the paper menus with grease stains all over them from previous diners are completely repulsive. But no matter...hotcakes!!! that's all you need to know.\n\nCash only, duh. I feel like we all know this by now."
0,"Wow.\nAfter stumbling across the below rebuttal to a review for their Tempe location, I will NEVER patronize Cartel again. You know what, Jason? If you don't like someone's bad review of your business, either offer to correct the problem or ignore it - don't insult them further. This is truly a disgusting attitude to have. \n\n\""Wow  Dave! You are hilarious! If only you actually understood coffee, you might have been able to actually promote better coffee in AZ! You shouldn't be commenting about coffee since you drink it with caramel anyway. You should probably rethink that life decision! As for your bad customer service experience, i deeply apologize for that! They no longer work for us. I would be happy to send you a bag of our coffee in the mail, so you dont have to come in. You just have to promise me you will taste before you add! Email me - jason@cartelcoffeelab\n(BTW - could you please clean up the profanity?)\"""
2,"Hm. First I hit three stars, then four...and back to three. I've been here twice, once was intentionally for brunch, and another for lunch. I'd go again if someone suggested it, but it's not at the top of my list.\n\nEveryone seemed happy with their food choices, and the menu is interesting. My last dish was the sweet potato chili. Flavorful and spicy, but thick for my taste. Cornbread was less than memorable. \n\nService was nice, and the food came out lickety-split. Also, the server didn't roll his eyes(can't say the same for myself) when my boyfriend's mom had to be explained what a \""shot of soup\"" is. Um, it's a shot. Nope, not a small cup. It's a shot glass--and then she asked for a spoon for her shot. Oy. That alone almost deserves a star."
2,"I don't think the food was terribly special, especially for the price. We tried two appetizers: fries and the fried fish. They were good, not great. Entrees, we had the pork chops and the roasted chicken. What made both of these dishes great were the other flavors in the dish. So to me, it seemed like the chicken;pork was more of a \""side\"" than the main highlight of the dish. Overall, the flavors were really nice, but it wasn't anything terribly special.\n\nI would give this a 3.5. I might try this one more time and get something new, but if my overall impression is the same, it'll be the last time.\n\nSo far, I preferred the other place that used to be there."
1,"I don't get it. I really, really don't.  People swear by this place.  I know people that have gone here for years, and for that reason I gave it my three strikes chance.  If a place has potential, or great reviews I will generally give it three tries to see if I had just missed something previously before I will take it out of my rotation of restaurants.\n\nWell dear Via Delosantos, you're out!\n\nThis place is a hole in the wall, so you expect it to be a lil quirky,  but I always left feeling like it was more towards dark and dingy. The service was never anything to impress on my visits, on my last visit it took around 8 minutes for our server to show up in the first place and I was considering walking out all together.  The food here is mediocre.  Definitely nice sized portions, and there are a couple winners to choose from, but with a menu this large it is expected that there will also be some losers as well.  They pride themselves on their margaritas, and maybe I am just used to stronger pours elsewhere, but I found them to be pretty weak.\n\nBasically, I find this place to be lackluster.  I am all about supporting the mom and pop, but there are plenty of other local Mexican restaurants to choose from, so all these people that swear by this place can keep it, I'll go elsewhere."
2,"Lay off the salt in the food and we'd be 4 stars. Had the goulash and spetzle and the goulash was way too salty. Other than that, awesome atmosphere and fantastic beer. I'd certainly come back for the beer, but might hesitate to eat here again. I've had better German food elsewhere."
4,"Got the munchies and realised it's already 4.30pm?\n\nDon't sweat, just wander over to Hanover Street and browse through Pret's delicious range of soups, sandwiches, baguettes, salads, hot wraps and pastries. Everything is made fresh throughout the day and the fact the shop's open til 7pm means there's always something left in the fridge. \n\nFor those on a health kick, they also sell apples, bananas, orange juice, smoothies, detox cordial, sushi and miso soup. I've had the latter on a handful of occasions and rate it better than the miso soup at both Yo! Sushi and Wagamama."
3,"Since I last reviewed this Sprouts location in 2009 (!), it's time for an update. Overall rating: Still 4 stars.\n\nI still have a love affair with Sprouts. The produce is still terrifyingly cheap, the natural foods are still reasonably-priced and frequently on sale, and Double Ad Wednesdays are still the best thing ever. That being said, the deepest discount produce is a little dicier than it used to be; berries in particular suffer from the giant sale displays not being refrigerated. The stuff you envision crazy coupon ladies screaming about? Be prepared to dig for the best stuff. The less desirable produce--you know, the stuff you should probably actually be eating--is still in good shape even on sale.\n\nThe meat counter, on the other hand, is vastly improved. A few of the old slackers are still hanging around but the awesome new guys more than make up for it. I've actually had them offer to go dig around in the back for me, which was unthinkable a few years ago.\n\nAs part of last year's remodel, they've added a hot soup bar, fresh muffins (delicious), a giant artisinal cheese case, and (foodie trendwhores rejoice!) a gourmet olive bar. Better yet, not only has the bulk coffee taken over A WHOLE AISLE, but the dispensers are now at adult human height. Mmm. Bulk coffee.\n\nIf you've been to other Sprouts stores, do check your expectations before walking in the door here; this is store #1 and isn't as large as the later locations (never mind the former Henry's or Sunflower locations). You won't manage one-stop-shopping here, but Fry's is directly across the street for all your not-made-by-hippies needs."
3,"Small? Yes. Parking? Sucky. But Awesome!!!! I worked in a comic book store for 10 years next to this place and my pores sweat their great menu. Upon entering the location you will notice that it reminds you of a dentist office. Weird but true. \n\nOn a weekday you will be hard pressed to not find an open table. Fridays through Sunday, good luck. It is an intimate space that allows you to keep your swearing to a minimum (there may be a kid right behind you, and I mean RIGHT BEHIND YOU). \n\nThe food is your basic \""kabob-style\"" menu. But this is not fast food. Lamb and steak cooked precisely to your request, veggie apps. like baba and tabouli are as fresh as it gets. Rice is delicious!  Also beware of their salad dessing...you will become addicted too it!\n\nSmall, but diverse menu. Very good service. Great to take out and eat at home. \n\n...They now have a corking fee, but who cares? Bring you biggest bottle(s) of wine and indulge, after all it is BYOB!"
4,"If you are in Vegas and you don't hang out at Hard Rock, then you haven't experienced VEGAS!!!!  Hard Rock is THE place to go to in LV.  Forget the fact that it is off the strip.  Once you are at HRH, you never need to leave."
1,"I have heard good things about this place and it certainly looks intriguingly cool from the outside. Alas, the food and the prices were where it all fell apart. My daughter had a vegetarian risotto that was well-prepared but the portion was dinky \u00a37.50. My husband had a cauliflower cheese that he liked but it was not anything special \u00a37.50. I ordered a fish of the day. It was something called a gurnard. This came entire on a plate. Was very bony and had some small worms we discovered after I ate what I could of it. I cannot say I enjoyed this thing, however sustainable a choice of fish it may be. It came with cooked, curly kale, minted peas and a dollop of potatoes which were okay. \u00a312.95. My youngest asked for her usual, plain, buttered pasta. This was fine but they charged \u00a34.95 for this until we mentioned how unfair that seemed. To their credit, they removed it from the bill. All the same. Our bill was over \u00a340 with the drinks and we came away somewhat unsatisfied. A shame. There are clearly some good cooks in the kitchen but portion sizes on the big meat dishes we saw go by were immense compared to what the vegetarians were offered. It seemed punitive in a way. Not sure I will try it again, even though the atmosphere was rather nice. Oh well."
4,"Proving you don't need fancy digs to pull off fusion cuisine, Chino Bandido combines Mexican and Chinese in a way that's not only good-tasting, but with a great sense of humor and an overwhelming eagerness to please.\n\nMy interaction didn't last long - just enough to order Pollo Diablo and some jerk chicken. Regardless of how incompatible those two items sound, it worked well, if only because both were crazy flavorful, and I sat there eating them out of a little tin with chopsticks. Cheap, good, and unique - it's all you need.\n\nApparently, you also need a snickerdoodle, because they gave me one for free. You win this round, Chino Bandido."
4,"Finally!  We found the place (opposite side of the Strip, not Henderson) that reminds us of home the most!  This place has been around for over a year or so now, opened by a Big Island guy!  So, you'd better expect BIG!  Expect to bring home some leftovers for dinner/lunch/breakfast the next day!  Every time we come here, we feel like we're back at home again!  For some reason, food (and music) will always take us back to the islands...\n\n*smack!* the Chicken Katsu Loco Moco!  First time ever trying both local favorites - together!  MmmMmmm!  Aaaand, leftovers to take home!  OHH!  And you should try their Fried Rice and Omelet!  I think it's on their Specials Menu!  That fried rice is soooo tasty, with huge pieces of sausage in it, and so very moist and perfect!  They serve it with 3 slices of Portuguese sausage, I think it's the Maui or Big Island kine!  HUGE!  And ONO, too!  Other goodies to try, Korean Chicken (saucy!), and their Kalbi!\n\nIf you are from Hawaii, and you live here in Las Vegas now, forget about L&L for your local fix!  Summerlin finally has a place that serves up one of the best local foods I've tasted since living here!  Broke da Mouth!"
3,"My sister was on Oprah for her fabulous job as a Wine Angel, so we decided to celebrate over dinner at Florida Cafe.  I've always wanted to try this place however it's downtown LV and it's quite a drive from my house.  The service is excellent, the food is delicious and the ambience is family friendly. Ohh and everything at such a reasonable price.  Highly recommended!"
2,"I like this little restaurant. The food is affordable, the waiter was funny and very friendly, and they appeared to have a cute back patio with misters for those hotter days. The food was fine, but the most memorable part was the service! Also the cheesy rice and beans on the side and the salsa are very good!"
0,Was expecting more than paper plates and plastic silverware. Waffles were dry and my kids immediately said we should have stayed home and made waffles there. The coffee was weak as well. Not a great start for our morning!
1,"Reviewing grooming service only. Second time I've gone to this location to get my dog's nails trimmed (a walk-in service). Both times there's been no one in the grooming area, and the manager has had to search for the groomer. The first time, the groomer was found outside, smoking. This most recent time, the manager thought the groomer might be out at lunch and might be back in 20 minutes if I wanted to wait. Really?! I drove across the street and went to Petsmart instead."
1,"The food was just meh. The \""atmosphere\"" relatively non-existent. It does appear to be a very family friendly place, so I guess that's a plus. I ordered the veggie omelette, added cheese, subbed grits & a biscuit. The dish was intended to be healthy, but I did my best to change that. Unfortunately the food was just incredibly bland. It was disappointing, especially because of the cost. If you're going on a weekend, get there early, it gets packed. I don't think I'll be back though."
3,"This review may be jumping the gun (***update below***) but I've already had memorable experiences with JSM. I'll continue to develop this review as my lease wears on. \n\nAlmost everyone at JSM is timely, professional, polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. Their professionalism and organization are stellar, and the extra touches, like the convenient blue folders they love to dole out, though simple, really polish it off.\n\nSigning with JSM was a pleasant, hassle free experience. They have cars to take visitors on apartment tours and they allow you all the time you need to read the lease in a private room. This, for me, underlined that they are not in the business of deception. No pressure at all except from the multitude of prospective tenants eagerly waiting to snatch available apartments.\n\nMove-in was a breeze. I did have issues with my apartment: aggressive mold, a moldy mattress box, a few broken odds and ends, and a building-wide roach problem *shudder*. My preliminary visit to the apartment was problem-free, so I assume most of these occurred during a hot and humid summer of neglect. I was worried that I had been swindled once more... but fear not, the speed and courteousness with which JSM handled everything was AWE-INSPIRING. Everything was fixed the day of or the next day by the super-nice, super-skilled maintenance staff. It was a rental miracle. Hail, JSM. PRAISE BE THE THREE-LETTERED DIVINITY THAT IS JSM.\n\nMy apartment smells like feet (though a carpet cleaning should have been in order at the termination of the last tenant's lease), I just squashed a roach, and I spoke with one office staff member who must have had the other end of the phone stuck up her prolapsing anus but otherwise, I am pretty happy. JSM is great. A little overpriced if we're talking about the apartment itself, but I can justify it because I'm paying for a reliable landlord.\n\n***Update*** \nThe roach problem is out of control. I've been afraid to eat here or turn on the sink lest I leave a stray water droplet out for these thirsty bastards. There are roaches -----in my bed-----, under appliances, crawling into and out of outlet plates. I see grandaddy roaches and pinhole sized babies and everything in between. And one just crawled into my blender!!! I was making a smoothie and lifted the container out only to find a roach crawling back into the portion that contains the motor. After this incident I checked my electric water boiler. Yup. Roaches had crawled in overnight. Ah! I had been keeping the boiler in my fridge to keep it from infestation but after treatment, I had been too optimistic and started leaving it out. My apartment has already been sprayed three times now. This, of course, is a problem with the building, not the landlord. JSM is still as polite and professional as ever and they've contacted me to work out a more robust solution."
2,"BB king's makes you forget you are in Vegas. The live music was good, pretty much what you would expect. The food was OK. But a nice change from the insanity of the strip... added bonus: no dudes slapping hooker cards all over in the restaurant."

3,"The gentleman that did my manicure/pedicure did a fantastic job on the french tips and made sure they looked very beautiful, for both the fingers and toes. The hands were air-brushed, which made them look very neat. I had a hard time understanding him, but we communicated enough to make sure the nails were done how I wanted. \n\nMy mom had a solid color put on her nails and was not impressed. There were little bits of nail polish left on the skin around her nails, so it did not look very professional. At the end she was left under the UV lamp to let her nails dry...without the lamp on! \n\nThe place was fairly clean."
3,"Its now at the Southpoint Casino. I got to eat here twice on a comp.\nOtherwise i would not justify the cost of $400 for two people that does not include tip.\n\nthe first time i went there i had lobster, its a very nice restaurant with great service. The lobster was huge must have been 5 pounds at least.\n the second time i went i had the Chateaubriand which was very good.\n\nI recommend Michaels only for very special occasions unless you have deep pockets. But its worth the experience"
3,"I'm originally from Southern California so I'm a big fan of good hole in the wall Mexican food. The staff here is nice, it helps if you speak Spanish which is another thing I miss about these places being from SoCal, but their pollo asado is awesome. The food is basic, beans, chicken, tortillas and rice is extra. It's good, comfort food and very flavorful. \n\nAs a plus, its probably in the best strip mall in Tempe, next to an awesome comic shop, Otto's Pizza and Cartel. Give it a try if youre in the neighborhood."
0,"My appointment was for glasses.  I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\n\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \n\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\n\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\n\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.  This experience has been so horrendous and I hate my glasses so much that I am seriously considering lasik surgery so that I never have to wear glasses again or have to deal with the hassle of getting cheated on a pair of glasses in the future."
4,This place changed my wife's views about seafood. When we first met she was not a big fan of seafood till Pappadeux took her mind to a new dimension. \n\nMust try items\n\n* Seafood Gumbo\n* Shrimp Etouffee With white rice\n* Atlantic Salmon Yvette\n* Tilapia Lafayette\n\nPappadeux is a winning at all times wish there was more locations in phoenix
3,"This is not quite 5 star, but it IS a solid 4 star most of the time. They built a newer store on Chandler Blvd that is closer to my house, but I have started going back to this location because they seem to make better food. Their salsa bar is not as good though, they do not have as many things in the salsa bar. \n\nI love the extreme Fajita burro if I'm real hungry, and the Green chili pork is pretty good as well. The Carna Asada is usually a little over cooked for my liking, but many people like it. Their Chicken Chimi is worth a try."
0,"We walked in on a Tuesday night with our child. The Yelp info said it was kid friendly. It most certainly was not. We felt like we walked into an American Apparel ad or an Of Montreal concert. The place was packed with 18-24 year-old drunk kids.  The only things missing: face paint and glow sticks.\n\nWe had about a 15 min wait. As we were being taken to our seats, one of the waitresses said, \""Who brings their baby to a restaurant?'  To which I replied, \""We do, you ass!\""  Nothing like a 22-year-old punk with a holier-than-thou attitude trying to ruin your night!\n\nThe food was only mediocre.  We all agreed that the tacos were overly greasy and all kind of had the same flavor.  Margaritas are margaritas.  The \""empanadas\"" were not empanadas I have ever had.  They most resembled empanada-shaped eggrolls.  The best part of the meal was the chips and salsa. They also charge extra for a refill of the salsa.  I've always thought it was lame to charge extra for a condiment.\n\nOverall, the food is not bad for a cheap Taco Tuesday.  I'd keep the kiddo at home next time. However, If I decide to bring her somewhere it will be my decesion and not up for review by some blond, jerk-off waitress...thank you very much. I give it one star because of the rude staff (even just that one girl). I don't have time for poor service and bad attitudes when I am paying for food that I can make better at home."
1,"Johnny Rockets at the Chandler Fashion Center..... DIRTY, the eating area and bathrooms dirty. Two employees behind the counter and manager sitting at his desk with his back toward his customers, it was not busy we arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday.  There was one table with three people having drinks. We ordered our food at the counter- different. I used the facilities before our dinner came. No paper towels in paper towel holder the floor was dirty bits of paper scattered throughout the bathroom floor, looks like the bathroom area  had not been cleaned in quite a while.  The lobby was just a dirty as the bathroom. One emplyee did come out to empty out the trash can in the lobby however was called back to the counter for what ever reason the trash can sat in the lobby filled with trash for 10 minutes, one emplyee did walk thru the lobby noticed the trash and walked right by it not once but twice! Finally the original person who started taking out the trash came back to finish the job. Not once did the manager walk thru the lobby  to see if it was tidy. Two thumbs down will not be retuning back to this Johnny Rockets. Aside from being dirty the burgers where good the onion rings not good a disappointment. Also did not like how they brought out our french fries and onion rings first then later brought out our burgers."
3,"Ok so if you're in search of Bellagio like contemporary furnishing sand Wynn style archiectural details, the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino is definitely NOT where you should be looking. The night life doesn't resemble anything you'd see at the Palms for instance. Instead, this environment resembles more of the airport than anything else. Dark, crazy patterned carpet everywhere with slot/game tables nicely organized throughout the building. IMO This IS certainly the best value in Vegas. PERSONAL ACCT: We booked a Premier King Size NON-SMOKING room over New Year's Eve, and I must say the room was as Nice as this place can be. Modern stylings, nice bathroom/shower area, flat screen LCD mounted, Closet Box/Drawers, 2 floating night stands, Platform Bed, Modern Desk with 2 comfy chairs by the Windows and a Thermostat controlled Wall Unit, with elegant drapery. You can feel the carpet is new. You can tell they remodeled the rooms as cheaply as possible without sacrificing the look of them. Also, there's a TGI Fridays on the grounds, a Buffet (of course), a Bar area equipped with table-top games, and other treats (gift shops, ice cream parlor, chinese restaurant). I almost FORGOT...the Free Shuttle service to and from the Strip every 5-12 minutes was a life-saver...very convenient."
3,"You can never fail with number 14 (pho with rare beef), and egg rolls. They are delicious, and all we ever order is a pho of some sort and the egg rolls.. We've ordered Chinese from here before, but it is not their forte."
1,"This place was just ok. Very pricey for the quality. We got the caprese salad & it had soggy, wet cheese (not mozzarella). The calamari had mostly fried cauliflower & it had no flavor. I had the pesto gnocchi & it was mostly beans & potatoes. The flavor was not good. Tasted very earthy. My friend got the black spaghetti & she said it was ok. My other friend had the pork tenderloin & she said it was good, but the veggies were way too butter to eat. I would not come back here."
1,"If you're looking for cheap tex/mex this is not your place.  More so authentic expensive mexican food. \n\nLoud band plays fri/sat/sun and its hard to have a nice conversation with the rest of your table.  We asked them to turn it down a notch, but they said it wasn't possible."
4,"It was a great experience! We had a lot of fun, it was definitely an interesting experience, lots of team building. The staff there is great and I really recommend it to anyone trying to do something different!"
3,Yummy! I enjoyed the pho and my friend enjoyed the bun. I know it was very nice inside.
3,"Decent food, pretty decent service...but it was hot in the restaurant, the medium had no spice whatsoever (although my husband appreciated that), and the service was a little slow. Maybe, if there is a next time, it will be better."
3,"Went here with the mother in law last night for dinner.  Table of 3.  Got there around 6:20.  Immediate seating for a Thursday.  FAR better than when I went to Fleming's in Midvale about 15 minutes prior, who absolutely would not seat us as we didn't have reservations, even though there were 5 waiters standing there doing nothing near the waiter station.... grrr....\n\nAnyways, The Tornado was great.  I had been there once before with the wifey a few years ago and felt it was above average then, but last night the food seemed much better than I remembered.\n\nShrimp Cocktail was standard, nothing special, but MIL likes it so we got it.  \n\nFrench Onion Soup above average.  Good heft to the broth.  The two other salads looked good.\n\nI ordered the Bone in Ribeye, which is my favorite steak due to the marbling.  Medium rare.  Cooked pretty well.  Very good flavor to the steak, perfect crusting and great texture.  A very very very good steak.  Probably a five star steak honestly.\n\nWife and MIL liked their filets as well.  I think the steak prices are 30-48$.\n\nDessert was a chocolate/caramel contraption, which I didn't really partake in but everyone else seemed to love it.  Total price ~ $150 without tip.\n\nVery well done restaurant.  Service was grea"
3,I found comfort and refuge here while living in las vegas.  I thought the food was good and the prices were reasonable for the quality.  Not far from the strip.
4,The food and drinks were delicious! Jake was the best. He took great care of us and really made the evening perfect!!!
3,"Oh so tasty! I had the Greek pizza. It was wood fire oven-baked goodness chock full of plump, flavorful kalamata olives, big chunks of excellent feta cheese, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts on a scrumptious thin crust. Fries just as they should be: hand cut and crispy on the outside, yet meaty on the inside. My dining pals had burgers that looked and smelled so good; they were raving over the flavor, freshness and ingredients. I'll have to get one next time. \n\nThe quarters are tight (only reason for four, not five stars) but they do plan to open seating upstairs soon. In the summer the entire front opens to outside seating. Everyone on staff seemed to genuinely enjoy preparing our food and they were extremely hospitable. Can't wait to go back, but I'll try a little earlier or a little later than noon, since it gets pretty crowded at lunchtime."
2,Nice park.....but not enough shades to watch the childrens... water park area
2,"Place is typical of what you will find for a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.  Went here for lunch and it's probably the cheapest lunch I've ever had at a little over $4 so a star for that.  The food came out piping hot and it was quite tasty so another 2 stars.  I felt the customer service was not all there.  The girl that helped me seemed bothered or annoyed by me.  Would I come back here?  Probably not.  As much as i loved how affordable lunch was,  you get what you paid for and you don't get a whole lot of food.  I liked this place better as its predecessor,  panda king."
0,Food is ok. For a restaurant on Fremont St there should be more than two people working at 2 in the afternoon in St Patricks day. Took over 30 min to receive food!!  Will not be back.
4,"Whats up with these portions?? I felt like a lil fat hungry kid at the table. My pancake was about a foot in diameter making the large sides of eggs and crispy potatoes looking miniature in comparison!! Glancing at the size of the meal i knew i wasn't going to be able to finish it all and thought \""something this big can't taste good??\""...right?? Wrong, the food was great. I do recommend the french toast over the pancake but it was good, good enough to remove the hangover i had. Our server was chipper and she had lots of jokes which made the experience even better, i think her name was Denise?"
3,Good service - they were a refreshing experience after the west flamingo shop. Thank heaven!
2,The place looked newly remodel. It was nice and clean. The waiter was very attentive however we picked a bad day with all the rain . The electric went out four times during our meal .  My salad was large with large chunks of avocado and plenty of chicken.  My associate had a salmon salad
2,"= = = = = = THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CHINA CHAN DAILY BUFFET = = = = = =\n\nDropped in here today with Norm R. & Mike C. to try the new buffet they have going.  There were only 19 items, with all of it good, but nothing outstanding.  (China Garden at 19th Av. & Bell Rd. gets higher ratings with a tiny selection like this by serving exceptional food.)  Also, empty, unused trays laying there in the serving table were a minus.  (Solution:  Bring out more food items!)\n\nRestaurant comfort was ok, & it was inexpensive at $5.99"
0,"We went here again because we apparently are sorely lacking in the intelligence department.  We decided to try some pie.  We got slices of apple walnut and blueberry.  How could anyone screw that up right?  Well, Market Street Diner does a fine job of creating mediocre to inedible pies.  Four years ago I came here and purchased a whole lemon meringue pie, it was horrible tasting and horribly expensive.  \n\nFast forward to 2012 and their pies still suck.  One of the people in our party is the kind of person who will eat AND like anything, but when I saw the screwed up look on his face after taking a bite of blueberry pie, I knew the the Earth was falling off its axis.  Deciding that perhaps he was having an off day, others of us tried some, and that's when it became apparent that somebody needs to be fired or go back to pie school ASAP.  \n\nThe apple walnut pie was better.  Of course, the bottom of my shoe is better than the blueberry pie, so that isn't saying much.  \n\nSo now, when we drive by Market Street Diner some of us hiss like vampires at the sun, others of us just make juicy vomiting noises.  \n\nI'm fairly confident we will never go here again, that is, unless it's the last restaurant on Earth, and we've completely lost our minds."
3,"I enjoyed the happy hour beer pricing. I'm not a huge beer fan but the Angry Orchard beer tasted like a hearty apple cider, it was crisp and refreshing without being the least bit bitter. The mushroom sliders weren't part of the happy hour pricing but they were worth every penny. They were served piping hot with the sauteed mushrooms and onions melding perfectly with the cheese and sweet bun. The burger patty was seasoned perfectly for my taste. The Nachos were HUGE. They were quite tasty as well with so many toppings including chili, and marinated jalapenos. We ordered the white steamed mussels (also not on the happy hour menu) and the portion was also generous with several pieces of garlic bread to sop up the delectable broth. The onion rings were okay, nothing special but the cajun mayo sauce that accompanied it was a surprise treat. Service was excellent, however as it got busier in the bar, the drinks started coming out slower. I was also annoyed that a whole family complete with small kids came in and sat close by with a screaming kid. I realize it's not the fault of the restaurant but it still soured the experience for me a bit. \n\nI like the friendly staff and that Angry Orchard beer, besides happy hour for 3 people came to just under $40 with all that food plus drinks!"
1,"I was told this place had the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  I'm on a perpetual quest for the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  It's a noble pursuit.  Right now I believe the best Italian food is at Centro Anni Alla Famiglia.\n\nI walked into this place and thought, \""people who said this was going to be amazing are damn liars!\""  It was not good.  The food was like Del's, and this is not an endorsement.  \n\nIf you enjoy paying a lot of money for mediocre Italian food you'll be able to tell was once frozen and likely freezer burned, this is the place for you.\n\nMaybe they were having an off day.  I hope so, because I really love good Italian food.  I was just very underwhelmed."
2,I really wanted to give this place 2 stars.  The service is fine and the food is very good even though the portions are small.  Believe this or not the Margaritas are terrible?  I do really like the atmosphere and they have plenty of space inside and out.  I would give this place another try.
2,"I've been coming to this place for roughly a decade. I've weathered name changes, staff changes and renovation and still come back from time to time. I went back there today and have mixed feelings toward the new management and what they did with the place.  First, I will say that, aside from the bathroom, the place was cleaner than I remember it. The mens room could use the floor bleached and the walls painted. Second, their latest remodel, while only slight, was done well. They could use some new bucket seats (tape doesn't cut it even if it does match color) on some of the booths.\n\nAJ presented a diverse variety of offerings in their buffet. To my recollection they offered many more sauces (including one jalape\u00f1o - yum!). The cook did a great job, the noodles were properly cooked, and the bit of service we received as polite. The price per person seemed a little steeper than what I remember but that could just be the time since I last visited.\n\nOverall, I'd go back. Though, I'd avoid using the bathroom."
2,The last time around they changed their menu a bit and raised prices. Portions got smaller and quality dimished.  Sad face.
0,"No longer a fan of this place. Overpriced shoes is the name of their game. I found their sneaker collection to be mediocre at best. Their customer service isn't very good either. Purchased some Nike Air Max's back in January, they didn't fit so I returned them and got something else plus a store credit. They only give you a store credit, no refund, and they give you a receipt for the store credit. Went back and they would not let me redeem it. \nThe Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel, but I am never going back to this place, it's simply a tourist trap, you will pay far more than you should. Stay away!\n\nOr better yet go to UNDFTD  on Harmon and Swenson, next to the Hard Rock\nI can recommend them."
4,"My experience here was great! The staff was so friendly and everything was very clean!  I did have a maintenance issue in my room, but it was fixed immediately and the staff apologized so much for the issue (which was a very minor issue). \n\nService was far beyond what I had expected.  I would recommend this if you are traveling to downtown Phoenix."
1,The ambiance and view is a 10. The service is a 9. The food is a 3 and this is only for the bread that comes to the table and salad was not bad. I got the filet mignon and it was a sad unflavored steak.  I have had better at Denny's. ( back in the college days) The veggies that were once frozen and when reheated were mush.  The cowboy beans were ... I have no words. I am kind upset because it was Valentines day .  \nThey really need to step it up and rethink their menu.  I would hate to see this place close
2,"The exterior looks a bit shady. It's just an old gas station with a chain link fence set up around it. I half expected to see the merch that \""fell off the truck\"" sold from the trunk of a car.\n\nBut no, it's all new, and in their somewhat dog-eared boxes. The showroom is simply the convenience store part of the gas station, stacked floor-to-ceiling with speakers, amps, stereos, and the like.\n\nIt's the kind of atmosphere that says, \""these folks are willing to deal,\"" and they did. We pawed through the goods, and made a nice stack of stuff we were interested in. \n\nWe did not get the hard sell, but the guy was available when we had questions. He was very knowledgeable about his products, didn't try to oversell, nor was he condescending -- all the qualities I look for in a salesman.\n\nIn the end, I think we got a fair deal for some quality components. Since we chose to do it ourselves, I have no experience with their installations, which, judging by all the folks waiting for their cars to be done, seems to be their actual bread and butter. \n\nMy only issue with the place is that their hours are rather random. Getting someone on the phone, or catching them open seems to be a hit or miss affair."
3,"We ate breakfast here and aside from the slow people serving you and clearing the tables, it wasn't too bad.\n\nI had the pleasure of having a club breakfast, which included 2 eggs your choice, bacon, sausage or patty, and then toast.  The orange juice was pretty damn good too..."
4,"I have actually never been to their store but I utilize their delivery service frequently. They are 9 times out of 10 on time or early OR occasionally running late. Their sandwiches,salads, and soups have saved me countless times when I am trapped at work with no way to grab any grub. I order online which is easy!!! My coworkers can order and pay separately and ladybug delivers in one drop off. They are great. I will continue to use them!"
0,Go to Chevron across the street! This gas station sucks. I went to 2 pumps and both didn't work. I finally got the next one to work but of course the printer didn't work to give me a receipt ughhh!!! So annoying especially when you're in a hurry!
0,"Like most other reviews here I had been around tot other boarding places for my two German Shephards. I immediately fell in love with this place and the staff. It wasn't until our forth extended boarding that something had to be said regarding the condition that our dogs were being returned in. Let me first say that our dogs are 9 month German Shepherd brother and sister that are still learning so I will not contest that they \""go\"" sometimes in the crate (they don't at home but often while boarding somewhere new). I never said anything about that to the staff at West Russell - what I am upset and quiet frankly irritated over is the lack of responsibility for delivering what is promised. It's very hard to describe in words the condition of our two dogs this past (and last) occasion. Putrid fermented pee is the best way I can paint a picture... Again I am not upset at the fact they \""go\"", I am upset at the fact they continually skip/ miss their baths and we pick them up filthy and then have to go spend more $$ at a groomer that often can't believe what they are smelling and feeling. This past time was arguably the worst - I called at 8a to confirm we would pick them up around 10a and to ensure they had gotten bathed prior to our arrival. The young lady stated she was the emergency member of staff and said she would begin soon. We arrive at 10a to crusty ears & under bellies and the same putrid fermented smell I mentioned above. I bring the dogs outside while my wife begins to dig deeper as to why and how this happened yet again after numerous apologizes before (after previous stays) assuring us this wouldn't happen again and also promising extra baths to ensure that promise. Sounded good given that we've probably spent in excess of $2,000 in recent months due to my travel schedule not to mention referring my brothers German Shepard for vet services and boarding as well... I was wrong, very wrong. The Vet who claims to live there is a very nice guy until you have a legitimate issue then he starts getting defensive... Ignoring the facts presented to him from regular/ referring clients. When my wife told him that were not here to argue, we just won't return he said \""that's fine\""... Rather than address the issues at hand. Sad really...\n\nMessage me for more details if you'd like."
1,"Go Daddy is hit or miss which is such a shame. They have the domain game down perfectly. Meaning they are the most well priced on the web and have the best back end UI for managing your purchases etc.  I own a few hundred with them. \n\nHere's where they fall short. Their hosting support and domain support isn't very good. I once had an issue that I called in a dozen times in 2 months for. Not to mention, the latest string of technical support issues that had me calling in 6 times in a day for something as simple as \""How do I create a new FTP user password that works for my IT guy?\"" Yeah that took 2 days to resolve effectively.  What's worse is that I even had a guy tell me to call back between 9am and 6pm to get someone who could help me better after I was on the phone with him for 30 mins. I am not sure if that was a blessing or a curse. \n\nIf you can find an alternative option for hosting or domain support I would go with it. Too often every representative tells you something different and you'll surely end up frustrated and yelling at the world after a few transfers and call backs. \n\n If you just need to buy and sell domains. They're perfect."
4,"Dear \u00e9,\n I love you!\n\nHow to:  \u00e9  is, as stated by other yelpers, a restaurant within Jaleo at The Cosmo hotel.  Reservations must be made, via email request, a month ahead.  There are two \""showings\"" a night, five nights a week, with 8 diners per \""show.\""  I feel special!  About a week before your reservation, you receive your GOLDEN TICKETS a la Willy Wonka in the mail.  Such a fun and whimsical touch, that truly did build my anticipation for the dinner.  I couldn't wait to show my ticket to all of my friends who didn't care what I was raving about at all, haha.  So you arrive to Jaleo and present your ticket, then review beverage pairing options before entering the hidden room to dine.\n\nService & Atmosphere:  Atmosphere so comfortable and unassuming.  The secret room was sort of like being inside Jose Andres mind.  Have I mentioned whimsical yet?  We had a maitre d, one lead chef and her team of three chefs, and I believe two waitresses.... for the eight of us.  Needless to say, I never had a need that was left unmet.  My water glass never half empty and my wine glass always refilled.  My questions answered before I could even direct them towards anyone.  The lead chef was adorable and personable, joking with us and being an amazing hostess.  It's so obvious that every employee was passionate about their work.  The story that accompanied each dish definitely is one of the aspects that makes the meal stand out to me.  By the end of the two hour meal, I was torn- I couldn't possibly fit another bite of food in my stomach but I was so sad to have the experience end.  The service was amazing, the fellow diners were amazing, and the food was obviously exceptional.\n\nFOOD:  Touched on every sense.  The textures, the smells, the presentation, the taste and the background stories for each dish were just so perfect.  23 courses, including certain beverage courses like the kava caviar sangria... sort of the fanciest most amazing jello shot I've ever had.  How will I ever eat again, if it isn't a dish from e?  I don't think I can manage real food anymore haha.  The food was explained as Spanish Avant Garde Tapas; Jose Andres took Spanish comfort food and memories and experiences and transformed them with molecular gastronomy and innovation.  Half of the fun was receiving your dish, trying to guess what it was going to taste like... and being completely (delightfully) wrong.  The chefs are so meticulous, it's amazing to watch and even more amazing to taste.  Some of the food was so pretty I almost didn't want to ruin it by eating it.  You must get the beverage pairing, by the way; it elevated the meal.\n\nI won't go over all 23 courses (they do change from time to time, by the way) but some notable were the:\n**Marienda--- it looked like the simplest of all dishes, a grilled cheese sandwich I mean really?  But I took a bite and just wow... So the \""Marienda\"" is a play on a sandwich that kids will receive in Spain as an afterschool snack, generally cheese and ham.  The bread was steamed brioche bun, so fluffy the best brioche I'd ever had and the only time I've experienced it steamed.  The ham was iberico, the best ham in the world!  Truly.  And some sort of Spanish goat cheese.  For a dish that looked so unassuming, the flavors popped.  I wanted to order a whole box of these just to take home!  \n**Spanish tapas experience all in one.  The idea is that you walk into a bar, you have a cocktail with some olives.  You maybe get some seafood to snack on.  The dish was mussels with liquid olives and orange air.  I'm not even a fan of mussels, at all, but wow it all just made so much sense together.  Liquid olives by the way, are very tasty.\n**Fried chicken skin, topped with chicken oyster and thyme air.  The most essential taste of chicken I've ever had, so tasty.\n**Other tastes: Chocolate paper with dried strawberries, saffron cream, caramelized baguette, iberico broth, squid ink, cod collar, rare skinless creamy Spanish beans, pork & squid ala plancha, truffle & anchovy cookie interpretation, apple merengue, blue cheese cream, almond 3 ways : puree almond shell, almond milk whip cream, almond dust and caviar, lobster with citrus and jasmine air, salt roasted foie\n\nExceptional dining experience, I highly recommend.\nLove,\n#6779"
0,"Oh wow! I'm so bummed, I was offered free tickets and it's been a while since I saw the show.  I had heard rumor that they fixed a lot of technical aspects and revamped overall. I'm sad to say, it's worse than before.  I was so bored and wanted to leave the second song in. \nI still don't recommend it, gave it a second chance and I still disliked this show very much. \nI feel horrible leaving such a crappy review, but come on Cirque, you can do waaaay better than that!!!!\n\nMost of the Elvis songs are sung by females.  Not sure how I feel about that. \nThe stripper pole section was still cool.  And the superheros were neat but not amazing!  :/"
3,Furniture Affair is awesome! They have a great variety of affordable furniture and accessories that you don't see everywhere else.
3,Clean. Good equipment. No crowds. Surprisingly few bros. A lot of serious lifters here.
3,"my favorite lunch spot everytime i come to vegas.  they have a great selection of burgers and the largest assortment of topping i have ever seen in my life.  i love the jalapeno bacon and the kobe burger.  for the non meat lovers, they also serve a great salmon burger as well.\n\nbe prepared to wait a little if you arrive there late."
4,"Best vape shop. Employees are really nice and prices are great. My favorite flavor out of the many I love has to be \""Don't tell\"" which is a strawberry vanilla custard. Simply amazing!"
3,"Hey, I'd love to stay at the Wynn, but I am in college. Since you spend like, zero time in your hotel that you aren't sleeping, why shell out all your cash to stay somewhere incredible?\n\nOur room at Bally's was practically free (package deal on PriceLine), plus we got a free upgrade to the nicer tower. The room was pretty huge, and it was really nice. The only thing that bugged me was the 80 year old TV. But like I said, the room wasn't the priority. \n\nCheck-In was easy, riding the people mover was fun and for the same price, we couldn't have even stayed in a Motel 6."
4,I am truly surprised at many of the reviews on this restaurant .but different strokes for ...well you know    First let me preface this review with an admission. If it has Asian noodles and broth ...I am in!  But not all noodles are created equal and Noodles in the Bellagio gets it right.\nFirst the service ....Some of the best of the week so far.  There was a line (always a good sign!) We stood in it for about 15 minutes but the hostess kept us up to date on how long about every three minutes. Really pro. We were seated in the comfortable surroundings of a top grade Asian noodle house. Once in our seats I could smell the aroma of wonderful broth and hear the familiar slurp sound that is a must in a noodle venue. We ordered appetizers. Easy choice was the chicken satay with an amazing peanut dipping sauce. Also sampled the shrimp tempura. So perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination. But the barometer of a noodle house is of course noodles in broth. I added the BBQ pork with egg noodles and the scrumptious bowl wafted out  the smell of the deliciousness to come. A perfectly cooked noodle with a fantastic broth were what i came for and received. I told my wife i could eat all my meals here this week. It was that good. I was pretty sure i picked the right place when I noticed the seventy five percent of the customers were Asian. Always a good sign! I usually rely on Yelp before trying a restaurant but i am glad I did not consult Yelp this time. I might have missed a special treat.
4,Best steak in Vegas!!! Service was GREAT! The side mushrooms was bomb!!! It's a must go when in Vegas! Well go back there again!
0,"What a disappointing experience! My fiance and I chose Holsteins this past Sunday. We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry. \n\nAfter eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. \n\nFast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I'm upset so I complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. \n\nThe service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, \""Well, you guys sure got a late seat\"". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's Miller Lite didn't come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn't inquire about our food. He didn't open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. \n\nThe food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. As someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing."
2,"Good customer service and nice place BUT they don't clean their tools. As I was being helped, I got a pedicure and fullset, I noticed they put everything back from where they got it without cleaning their tools. For my pedicure they used a dirty nail file and pumice. For my full set, the nail filer was dirty as well and the desk was very dirty too. The UV light desk is super dirty as well. This would be a five start place if it wasn't for the cleanliness."
1,"First, you go here for the view of the Bellagio fountains. Which is really good if you get a table outside and can stand the heat.\n\nAs for the food, been here 3 times and the food is way over priced for the quality.  Had eggs benedict last time and the muffins were flat and there was very little sauce. Bloody mary was just ok. \n\nService was good, but if you want a meal with your view of the fountains, try somewhere else."
4,"I came here with co-workers and was instantly hooked. I usually get the falafel pita (I add hummus; no tomatoes) with fries. You can get it as a combo, which comes with a drink, for less than $9. The falafel is always perfectly crisp & tasty. Their pita bread is always so very fresh; always. Like, seriously; they never have an off day. Their hummus is a yummy traditional flavor with a light olive oil.  That heavenly pita bread, spread with hummus, encompassing 3-4 crunchy falafel balls, with cool lettuce and fresh cut onions = triumphant flavor explosion in my mouth. I close my eyes and go, \""ommmmm\"" with each bite. And the french fries? OMG. Made to order, so they're fresh, hot, & crispy every time, and coated with a delicious seasoning. Simply irresistible. No diet is safe!  If you go with friends, split a side order of fries. You'll get a huge heap for only $2.\n\nMy meat-eating friend is in love with their Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken. She says the chicken is amazing & seasoned to perfection. \n\nThere are a decent number of tables inside, some Mediterranean decor, and TVs. They have self-serve fountain drinks as well as bottled water. There are Sriracha bottles scattered about for your spicy-dosing pleasure. They also have an outside covered patio with several tables. I love the patio during non-summer months. We come during the lunch rush and the service is always pretty fast. When we're rushing or just being lazy, their convenient drive-thru saves the day.  The parking lot can get very busy though, and sometimes there's a tight squeeze between the parked cars & the drive-thru, so be cautious with your vehicle. \n\nZ's Greek is an awesome lunch or dinner spot for veg*ns & omnivores. Consistently amazing food. Best falafel in the Valley, hands down."
4,"I'll make this easy. This is the best buffet in Vegas, maybe the USA. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. We ate here on a Thursday night so we did have to wait about 45 min. The selection is overwhelming, from custom tacos, to Kobe sliders, to scalloped potatoes with truffle sauce...you really have to scout the buffet  once you are there, don't start taking food...be strategic. Most importantly, leave room for dessert. This buffet is utterly amazing...."
3,I come to this restaurant every time I'm in Las Vegas. The evening I went it was crowded and the waiter seemed stressed. Even though we had reservations they still made us wait 15 min. They seem to do this every time I come here. The view is fabulous! The food was perfect. It was my birthday so they brought me cookies. The only complaint I have is the restrooms were filthy. Both men and women's.
3,"This place has great food!  They start with a healthy version of chips and salsa. Baked tortillas and warm pur\u00e9ed black beans and salsa. Delic!! \n\nI've dined here several times, and each time the food and the service have been excellent. \n\nSuper nice ambiance, and they have a great Happy Hour!!"
3,"The best aspect of this surf/turf restaurant is the atmosphere - bustling and in view of Bellagio fountains. We had to wait a few minutes even though we had a reservation, which was fine because there are two bars.  \n\n[frisee & warm bacon salad with soft-poached egg, croutons] \n-- absolutely delicious! the poached egg is an amazing addition and actually emulsifies the dressing - yum.\n\n[sea scallops, butternut squash puree, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, brown butter]\n-- scallops were cooked perfectly, large portion but needed more salt. Squash was good but a bit bland and the brussels sprouts ok."
3,"This is a bitter sweet restaurant to me.  I always go here when I am feeling health conscious.  The fish is grilled instead of fried, the food is not very oily.  I love that.  On that same note, the food lacks a punch.  I think because it is prepared on the healthier side, the food lacks flavor.  I wish the fish had more spices, I hate having to compensate for it with their homemade hot sauce, it's so spicy!!  I end up mainly tasting the hot sauce instead of my food, I have made this mistake several times!\n\nBut I still give it four.  The portions are big, and the food can be prepared clean and healthy, everyone is really nice, the restaurant is fun and high energy.\n\nRandom thought:  I secretly wish the veggies could be added to the burrito without teriyaki sauce.  Never been a fan of the teriyaki.  Since we're going healthy here, we might as well go all the way and go no sauce!!"
3,"3.5 stars. Good central location, not as loud and smoky as some of the other hotels. Very comfortable and stylish rooms. The taxi valets were my favorite (they kept me safe from the CES dorks)."
3,"We had a great time here last Thursday night.  I joked on my facebook page that this place serves \""upscale\"" pub food, which I believe is oxymoron.  Upscale pub food.  Ha.  Anyhow, the mussels appetiser (substituted the spicy tomato sauce with the white clam sauce instead), was fantastic.  The mussels were tender yumminess.  We ordered the recommended Fish and chips and the Lobster rolls.  The fish was crispy and juicy.  The lobster rolls were quite delicious (my only beef was the the lobster was actually the claw meat rather than the tail).  Service was great.  Very friendly.  Atmosphere was fun. \n\nOh, we also did the $2 oysters.  First we ordered 3 of each oysters from VA and Baja California.  Then we chased it with another half dozen of the oysters from VA.  Delicious.  Not bad for $2.  Our bill was over $150 tax and tip.  Not cheap; we are in Vegas after all."
3,"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it over there last Friday.  I was meeting a good friend who is ALWAYS late so I sat down outside and had a beer.  Where can I begin?  Mike and Kevin were great...very attentive and pleasant.  The ambiance is the BOMB, especially since the weather's so nice.  We went to town on brats, belgian fries, and even dessert.  It was all really yummy and definitely an option when going out with friends in the future.  The only thing that would get this place an additional star is putting more fun stuff on the menu!!!"
3,"J'ai bien aim\u00e9 une petite soir\u00e9e ici l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier sur la terrasse. La nourriture est de qualit\u00e9 et l'ambiance est agr\u00e9able.\n\nNourriture typique du Moyen-Orient avec kebab, hummus et autres plats r\u00e9gionaux. Recommand\u00e9 bien que j'ai quand m\u00eame trouv\u00e9 l'addition un peu cher (du moins en soir\u00e9e)."
1,"With 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate not too far away....this place just doesn't cut it for me.  I ordered the \""garlic chicken\""....no garlic...just sweet and sour chicken?! Very misleading description.  Coworker orders Portuguese sausage/eggs/rice...what can go wrong, right?!  Um...the box opens and I ask did you order corn beef hash....it is some strange dried spam patty looking thing...no bueno.   They should probably just call this place China Barbecue, because there isn't anything Hawaiian that I can spot.  We also tried the ahi tuna poke...I will give them credit for having fresh fish, even if the marinade wasn't amazing."
1,Did I miss something. Every time (4x's) I have been to this place it has been morguelike and the food  is barely average. What is it you are all eating?
0,"I was denied care at this facility over when it is appropriate to ask patients for the copay.  I will not pay for services before they are rendered; thus, when I objected to paying before seeing the doctor, I was told to leave.  When I told the staff that if I had a serious condition and that by refusing treatment they were potentially opening themselves to the possibility of a lawsuit, I was told \""go ahead and sue us.\""\n\nThis behavior is abhorrent.  I will be reporting this facility to the state medical board."
4,"I'm ready to move to Phoenix to be closer to my new love, Dick's Hideaway.\n\nThanks Phoenix yelpers for directing me to the mother of all whole-in-the-walls.\n\nI ordered the first thing I saw on the menu, Pasta Heidi, which is green chile linguine with grilled chicken in a chipotle cream sauce.  It was so good, I'd like to move to Phoenix and get a job at Dick's, just for the employee meal.  I'll have to settle for a few more meals there before we leave town, because my husband thinks I'm being ridiculous.  I blame Dick's.\n\nCan't wait to try their breakfast AND lunch.\n\nSee you tomorrow Dick's Hideaway.\n\nLove Mary-Anne"
2,"It has been a few years since I have been back at this place but now that I am working back on this side of Uptown, I went back for breakfast because they had good oatmeal at a good price and some decent toppings.\nI am not sure how the rest of the place is because I haven't been back for lunch yet but breakfast was disspointing.\nThe oatmeal has been moved to self serve, which is perfectly fine. But it is not well monitored. The oatmeal consistency is now waaay to thick. So much so that it's a struggle to get it out of the laddle.\nThe first time I went, they were out of oatmeal lids so I myself had to rumage underneath the cabinet to find them because no one would come over and help and there were three other customers looking for lids. Today they did not have the larger oatmeal cups and said they were completely out.\nI'm not sure if managment changed or if I caught them on back-to-back off days, but it doesn't make me want to rush to come back.\nI used to love this place and there is a lot of potential so I hope they step it up."
2,"I went to dinner here with a party of four.  Two of us thought their meals were exceptional (they had the Kobe meatloaf and the scallops) the other two of us thought it was just ok (mahi mahi and prime rib).  Overall, though, it was a good experience.  We didn't have any of the problems with service that some of the other reviewers mentioned, but that may be because there were only about 10 people (including us) in the restaurant at the time.  Really, I think this place was good but probably not worth the money.  However, since there are not really many options in downtown Phoenix (other than sports bars) within walking distance of Symphony Hall, I will definitely be going here again since I have no choice!"
4,"I took the Old Town Discovery tour with our group of executives. Living in Scottsdale we thought we knew the city but were blown away by the tour itself and the knowledge of the downtown area by Todd and Becca. If you are looking for something different to do with a group or family, this should be at the top of your list. These guys are the top rated activity company in Scottsdale, and for good reason. I highly recommend Scottsdale Segway Tours!"
2,"I eat here occasionally because it is by my work.  I think the pizza here is better than at the other one (if you have read my review of the other Monicals you would understand).  I typically get carry out and lately they have had coupons for a $4 or $5  individual pizza which is the perfect size for lunch. \n\nYesterday, I ate in with a friend and I must say this place is loud.  Over the top loud.  I had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said.  We finished our food and got out of there so we could visit.  \n\nOur waitress seem pissed off about something so we were very careful not to ask her for anything.  She never smiled in fact, I am not even sure she said 2 words to us.  It took 10 minutes for her to come and take our drink order.  She also slammed down our salads, the dressing and our drinks and flew off in huff.  I swear we did not do anything to make her mad.  However, I do believe if I had to work in such a loud place I would be pissed off too.  We heard a bunch of plates fall back in the kitchen and we knew what had happened.  And that really made her madder.  Oh dear!  So, we ate our food, paid our bill (yes, we left her a tip) and ran out the door.  We agreed that we would not eat in again but we will get the take out.\n\nThe salad was cold and fresh and the dressing was really good.  The pizza was cooked just right and I asked for light green pepper and I got 7 pieces.  Bottom line is the food is good but I would advise carry out or delivery if at all possible."
2,"This place was alright. Overrated for sure. \n\nThe place is real small so we had to wait before we got a table. Once we got a table, we had to go up, order our food and pay first. After we did that, we got some water and went back to our table where we proceeded to wait over half an hour before we got our 2 dishes. The first few bites tasted good and after that it was just meh. \n\nMy bf's dish didn't look to appetizing, almost like they did it so sloppily on purpose. My dish was quite dry for a chorizo crepe. i did enjoy the bananas though! lol. \n\nThere were also huge flies inside the restaurant because the doors were constantly being opened and closed so that was annoying. \n\nI don't think we will come back here to eat, esp being that it's so expensive."
3,"Open until Jan 5th\nHours of operation is Sunday - Thursday 5:30pm - 9:00 pm and Friday and Saturday 5:30pm - 10:00pm.\n\nOn weekdays (sunday-thursday) it costs $15 to go in and $20 Friday, Saturday, and holidays. There's also a season pass you can purchase for $55. Price is based per car not per person. \n\nWhat a fun place to go to during the holidays! I went on Christmas Day when family and friends were looking to do something fun with the kids. I think this included me. It was my first time coming and it was fun  looking at all the lights that were put together by the different sponsors. Some lacked more interesting designs and others like McDonald's did the most (go figure). You drive through the Speedway bleachers and up and around the Speedway itself. I think the best parts are the tunnels filled with lights. \n\nTrying to get into that holiday feel? Tune in your radio to 101.5 fm for Christmas music. Even in January it still feels a lot like Christmas! I wish the rates were cheaper as I didn't think $15-20 was worth the light show especially since some parts of the tour felt bare. I mean we are using our gas too you know! You can also order hot chocolate as well if you want to. \n\nEither way it was a good experience. The kids had fun including me. I'd definitely take the family out again! Hopefully they change up the designs too every year but I'd have to go again next year to find out!"
3,"I just got married here in September and I truly loved it!!  This place is a little gem.  The Regency Garden gave us a weddings all inclusive menu that took the hunt out of finding the right people to do the job!!!  It was beautiful, and elegant and at the same time not stuffy or plain.  I would definitely refer my friends to get married here.  \n\nThe only complaint that I have is that the photographers could have done a better job as well as offer a better package with the Regency Garden.  On that note they have tried to accommodate and fix the issue, but you just can't get back pictures that weren't taken, especially on your wedding day...."
3,"So you're sitting at the Canopy Club, maybe you're drinking a beer and watching the band and/or gawking at the scenery why not have a slice of pizza as well? \n\nThe super slices are $1.75 for cheese, $2.20 for 1-topping and $2.75ish for specialty. \n\nThe slices are a double slice, but they are thin, which is great if you like thin crust. They are excellent!"
0,"Very disappointing.\n\nThe negatives began before we were even able to check in. The \""door man\"" in front of the hotel was rude to us as we were unloading out luggage. As soon as we pulled up to unload he told us rudely that the parking lot is across the street as if he didn't even want us stopping for three minutes to unload the car.\n\nAfter a long day of traveling we were ready to get into our rooms and take a quick nap before going out to dinner and meeting up with our family. We arrived at the hotel around 4:00pm, tried to check in to our reserved rooms and were told that the rooms were not ready yet. According to the hotel's website the checkin time is 3:00pm so we were upset that the hotel made us wait in the lobby for two hours before finally being able to check in.\n\nThe majority of the hotel was under construction and the front desk staff was very rude and did not seem to care about any of our issues.\n\nI would never stay here again, and I would think twice about staying at another Sheraton property as this was one of the first I had been to."
3,"Having been to Fleur de Lys in California, I was quite anxious to try Fleur in Vegas.  I say that most of the food and service was good but the most unique and memorable item was the Kobe beef foie gras truffle hamburger.  I have a handful of unforgettable items that I have eaten and this is one of them.  However, it was quite expensive and if we didn't have a gift certificate we probably wouldn't have ordered it."
3,"I don't go to a heck of a lot of movies in theatres (I'd rather curl up with my beloved NetFlix with a beautiful glass of wineand watch on my 5' x 7' theatre projection screen,  than walk on popcorn and lean my head back on a chair on wonder how many other heads of hair were here last).\n\nBut I have to say, there the experience at Cini Capri makes the theatre going experience something I don't mind going to in this cinema.  \n\nNow, if only they had a full service bar - why don't movie theatres do that, btw ??  (that's why the minus 1 star...)"
3,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly. \n\nClean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation."
1,"My partner and I went to Noodle Asia the day we arrived in Las Vegas.  We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.\n\nThere was an extremely long wait to get seated - and there were only three parties ahead of ours (one of which had 6 people, the others were couples).  It also took a very long time to get anything to drink and to have our order taken; this was at lunchtime so perhaps they were understaffed.  Fortunately the food arrived quickly after we ordered it, and when we were ready to leave, my doggie bag was brought quickly.\n\nI was quite disappointed in the food, however.  When a restaurant is specifically advertised as having multiple vegetarian dishes, I expect them to be either marked with an icon or in their own section - but here, I had to ask the hostess to explain what dishes on the menu were vegetarian.  There were not many of them, although she claimed that a few could be \""made vegetarian\"" by leaving out meat.  (I am always skeptical of this, because very often they use beef broth anyway.)  I ordered the Buddha's Feast noodles and my partner ordered the Shanghai Noodles; hers were much better than mine.\n\nThe atmosphere at Noodle Asia is not good at all.  It's mostly sheltered from the casino, but wide-open to the sports book.  I did not enjoy staring at 87 TV's showing all kinds of sports while I ate.\n\nIf you are already at the Venetian and craving Asian food, but you can't afford Tao, then Noodle Asia is not too bad.  But otherwise, I'd stay far away from this restaurant."
1,"This hotel is relatively inexpensive (based on a very quick search before a spontaneous trip) and our room was actually quite nice. Based on other reviews I can assume this means we got one of the renovated rooms, which must have been a stroke of luck.\n\nOn the downside, the location isn't convenient to much, the staff is curt and not particularly competent, and the wifi was completely unusable--during the three days of our stay connection speeds ranged from zero to barely 1 megabit per second, with constant failures. The staff was unhelpful and unapologetic about this. I realize that it's hard to get a good signal into every room of a large building ... but if you promise it, you have to do it. Don't treat us like troublemakers when we're not getting a service we paid for. \n\nThere were other administrative screw-ups that led to us complaining (uh ... why are we locked out of our rooms? We're booked for another day). These problems were resolved, but again unapologetically. The staff attitude was that they were doing us a favor. \n\nBe prepared to use the stairs if you stay here. It's a 7 story hotel with a large floorplan, and it's serviced by a single elevator. It is neither a large nor a fast elevator. If you are unable to walk stairs, be prepared to budget 10 minutes of your life for every trip to or from the lobby. \n\nMontreal is awesome. Next time I'll planning ahead and will try to use Air B&B."
2,"Like most dog parks, this place always has your typical clueless dog owners who let their crazy dogs run wild while they sit on the side and text message.  I have seen a number of aggressive dogs in here and watched the owners laugh when their dogs got mean or dominant with other dogs.  Some people don;t even pay attention or care.  This is typical in almost any dog park.\n\nYou also have your neurotic scottsdale housewives and bimbos who come here and watch their dogs act like total shitheads while they do nothing to correct their dogs or get them away from a potential disaster.  Let's not forget about the idiot parents who take their little kids here and let them run around screaming and yelling.  That is always nice in a park full of dogs that are already at extreme high energy levels.\n\nThe park itself is nice and pretty clean.  It can be very congested at times.  I guess if you don't care about the safety of your dogs or stupid people, this place is cool.  I won't ever take my dogs back here.  Too many idiots and unstable dogs running around."
2,"This place is solid. Nice decor/feel, except it was a bit empty during weekday happy hour after work, and the bathroom has that terrible fake gold paint that seems like it was slapped up in the dark. \n\nThe food was solid. I had some sushi that wasn't the freshest but I guess I'd give it another try. My fiance had the thai pepper beef. The flavors on his were excellent, even the rice itself was tasty and well-cooked, but the beef was a bit thin and overcooked.\n\nOverall, I may go back because I work in the area, but perhaps should try a time when they are a bit busier and the food might be fresher."
0,"I sadly thought my meal was awful here.  \nI ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings and was sorely disappointed, the shrimp tasted like cheap frozen shrimp farmed in ponds dumped with antibiotics and then treated with bleach after.  I also tried some noodle soup and I wanted to like them but the texture and flavor was off-putting to me.  I expected a lot, $10 for eight tiny dumplings that \""tasted\"" like i could have gotten them frozen in an asian grocery store somewhere wasn't what I expected.  I have only tried two dishes, take this review with a grain of salt, but I am scared to go back and try anything else because i fear it will be a waste of my money on top of experiencing even more disappointment."
1,Ecasketch bad service. Wrong order. Poor chris ..super hereo sosa to rescue! Dipped chocalate cone check. Lol!
2,"Not a bad place to see a show. Yes, parking is pricy, but alternatives are available. With the small venue, it's easy to see the stage from anywhere. Drinks are expensive, too, but they know their audience and they're targeting what they know they want. Candy is expensive at a movie theater, but people still buy it. Anyways, I've seen some great acts here and I think a lot of the little things can be overlooked, at least for me."
4,"I love the Rio.  I have to drop by for lunch every time I'm up in the Northwestern part of the valley.  The staff is friendly, courteous and cheerful.  The food is awesome, and generally it is served amazingly quickly after we order.  The chicken chimichanga is my favorite.  My husband will vouch for \""The Ocho,\"" or the eighth combination plate as it is known on the menu.  Their margaritas are also good.  I don't order margaritas very often because I am usually disappointed with the flavor, but the Rio's lime/tequila/orange liquor balance is just right.  \n\nI have never gotten a bad meal here.  Even the rice is moist and delicious.  I thought all Mexican restaurants considered the rice plate garnish until I ate here.  The salsa and freshly fried tortilla chips that they bring to the table are also really tasty.  Their extra hot salsa (which you can request) is plenty hot, but not as flavorful as their regular salsa."
3,"The food's fresh, the service is good and we eat here fairly frequently. We like the baja burrito with fried fish :)"
0,must i give them one star?\n\nOhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!  nooooooooooo!  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\n\nWhat kind of amateurs?  Hooooooooooorbile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nLike immigrants figuring out what to sell us while they figure it out...\n\nthe burger wAS HORRIBLE
4,"This was my first time going rock climbing, and I had a blast!  If you go with a group of 6+ they have a group rate of $11+ tax which includes gear rental.  Otherwise, the price is $18+ tax for the day pass and gear rental.  Greg was the person who gave us instruction on how to use the gear, tie the knots, and belay.  He did a good job, and was very patient as we learned the basics.  There are a lot of different walls to choose from, with varying difficulty levels.  Generally, the closer you are to the front entrance, the easier the climb.  After I finished scaling various walls (I started with a 5.4, then tried a 5.6 and 5.7), I watched in awe as people climbed up angles I didn't think was possible to climb.  Although my arms are feeling the burn as I type this, it was well worth it, and a great experience.  I'd definitely like to go again.\n\nP.S. They have lockers for you to use, but remember to bring your own lock to store your valuables."
4,Best saved for the last. Make sure you get front seats to have ultimate fun. Wait till end of the show. Loved it on valentines day\n\nThanks\nSantosh
0,"A walgreens with no liquor? What am I, in Utah?"
2,"Decor is great and the service was nice overall, especially considering it was a nightlife venue. The food was nothing spectacular, but in defense of the restaurant I thought my group ordered poorly. Got Spicy Lobster Roll, Angry Dragon Roll , Satay of Chilean Sea Bass, Pad Thai Noodles, and a bunch of drinks. I ordered a round of drink for some friends at another table, but one got drunk and they all left, so we have to drink them. I drank so much, I forgot to order the large fortune cookie for dessert. The drinks were ok to good. We got the Mango Tamarind Martini, Xi Gua Tini, Lychee Martini, TAO Love Potion #9, TAO-tini, and some Patron. Og, the Miso Sea Bass (appetizer or entree) was great. Miso fish usually is."
2,"No proper greeting. Seemingly too busy to appreciate customers, or provide a positive customer experience. The service was ok. I just do not think that they are equipped to handle the amount of customers that they have. The food was good, but took more than 15 minutes after placing our order. A couple of the items were prepared differently than their other location, usually multiple locations prepare menu items identical."
4,"Totally worth it!!!  This sexy man was engaging, sensual, and thoroughly entertaining!  What a VOICE! And those EYES!!!  He hugged me and he smelled DIVINE!!  He had me at hello!!!  Any day...ALLL day!!  Step aside Mr. Newton and Buble...here's GOSS!!"
0,My BF and I stopped for a drink this evening on our way to another restaurant for dinner.  The bartender could not have been more indifferent.  We won't be going back to eat there no matter how many good food reviews I read.
2,"I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, husband agreed.  The service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great.  Their chopped salad really is something special.  But, I was quite disappointed in receiving 3 medium size scallops for dinner. And I didn't find the other dishes I tasted great.  For the money, I just can't rate the food any better than this."
0,"Saw Dr. Hetrick and was GREATLY disappointed!  I have Chronic nerve pain all over.  After a 30 minute visit, he said, \""I do not feel badly about not being able to help.  Several doctors have not figured it out, either.\""  I was dismayed and frustrated.  He looked at his watch and the visit was over.  Please do not go to see this doctor.  It will be a waste of your time and money."
4,#1 family-owned Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. Staff is always so welcoming and open to accommodating your meal to your liking. I bring my girlfriend here whenever we are craving peruvian cuisine. Definitely recommend the Ceviche Mixto and the lomo saltado. You have to try the Inca Cola with your meal.  The ultimate meal is the Seafood platter sufficient for two. I have tried every peruvian restaurant in LV and this is my favorite! The owner is very humble and respectful.
0,"I know I know,it was memorial weekend and whole las Vegas was packed.....but I made a reservation around 3weeks ago, and they juz ignored my request of 2queen beds room. Giving me a king size bed with a add-on twin bed instead. Tht room costs 560+tax.....my fds and I juz didn't feel good and not quite acceptable.... Worst???? The add-on bed was standing against he wall when we got in....then we asked them to set it, we checked it 4hrs later(around 1 am) and it was till standing up. Paying extreme high price to receive this kind of service in a five stars hotel just doesn't make sense and all I can say is disappointing."
1,"I've had the original pink box donuts bookmarked forever, but since it's completely on the other side of town in an area that I never get to, I waited patiently for them to open a location closer to me. I was walking around Town Square and remembered they had opened here, so I had to stop in. \n\nDecided to do a half dozen to sample. \n\nFat Elvis (x2)\n\nCampfire s'mores \n\nCheesecake \n\nMaple Bacon\n\nKey Lime Pie\n\nAfter my first bite of the Fat Elvis, I was excited for this flavor, then I had a second bite and hit the horrible peanut butter frosting in the middle. It was so artificial tasting. Key Lime Pie, I love anything citrus/sour, this again was so artificial tasting and it burned going down (not in a spicy way, a not nice sour way). Maple Bacon was beyond my comprehension. The bacon was horrid. \n\nI will save this place for all the donut lovers. Wasn't my thing."
2,"We were seated really quickly, but the service here is lacking.  We had to hunt down the waitresses to get them to take our order, and when we got our food, we had to ask for EVERYTHING -- hoisin sauce, sriracha, chopsticks, and those soup spoons.. You would think that they would have these things out immediately with our meal.  Guess not..\n\nThe food here was decent - nothing to complain about.\n\nWouldn't exactly recommend this place.  Pricey food & bad service isn't a good combo.  But if you have a dying urge to get pho in Las Vegas, then go for it."
3,"Pros: \n  This is a Borders that is conveniently located on Las Vegas Blvd.\n  Seattle's Best Coffee inside with a friendly staff\n  Awesome clearance section with some really good buys !\n  Friendly, knowledgeable  staff always willing to help out\n  Organized (which surprises me considering the foot traffic)\n  2 different signals for WIFI (super fast free WIFI)\n\nCons:\n  The cafe definitely needs more seats,  but there is seating throughout the bookstore itself (which is actually a plus!)\n  Bathrooms are not as clean as the store itself\n  Magazines section is always a disaster (at least every time I go)\n  \nVerdict:\n  Nice place... nothing too special about the Border's. They seem to have a better selection of books (especially in clearance) when in comparison to the Border's near my house.  The staff is always friendly and there is a pretty diverse crowd.  It's usually my place of choice when I need to get some work done outside of the house....why not, with Fast WIFI that has never failed me, I have no complaints.  Just clean your bathrooms and your on your way to a 5-star in my book.\n\nTips:  \n  In the cafe there is art from what appears to be local artists (at the moment its Photography).  Check it out !!\n  If available, take a seat on the leather chairs in the corner of the store.  They are super comfortable.  It's also a perfect location if you need to juice up your electronics.  Plenty of sockets around the perimeter of  Seattle's Best."
4,Great service and food. Definitely will be coming back for the delicious burger for lunch
0,"Whenever I go here I feel like everyone knows a secret about this place that I don't. The food isn't Asian in any meaningful sense, and it isn't particularly good in general. So why is it packed out and the dishes so relatively expensive?\nI just had the new Lemongrass Prawn, which was pretty good as far as that goes, but not even remotely Chinese. The fake Asian decorations are more annoying to me than anything, and the dim ambience is destroyed by the TVs playing at the bar since they can be seen from just about every table in the restaurant. The general pretense of classiness was ruined for me when I went to the bathroom only to find spanish profanities written all over the stall.\nSomeone in my party was served the wrong dish, and it took a while for us to get the right one. We were mistakenly given an appetizer which we had not ordered. Clearly, the serving system is incapable of handling a full restaurant. I also saw people being moved to different tables to make way for other, larger parties. I understand the business sense, but that's a completely classless move. Our server was very friendly, but rushed us out as soon as we were done eating.\nBland food, poor service, long waits, and high prices? I'll pass."
0,"please batter your crab, last time i ate the crab it had no batter it was horrible, i would give you guys a redo on this but, besides that, you guys are worse the sushi rock, i ordered over 100$ worth of sushi, and yet none met my satisfaction, please once a sushi restaurant goes bad, it goes bad forever, so redirect yourselves."
4,"Very reasonable, professional would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a plumber.  Called Dave and he came right out that day."
4,"Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...\n\nBUT....\n\nThis is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's. \n\nI love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.\n\nI wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan."
3,"It might not be located in one of the best places in town, but it is worth it. Something that I really struggle with in Arizona is finding a seafood restaurant where the food is as good as the service. I must say that I have found it! Finally!!"
3,"My third cirque du soleil show, first time seeing Mystere, and another mesmerizing performance with plenty of amazing acts that leave you wondering just how incredibly athletic and strong the performers are. Each of the three shows I have seen all had uniques aspects to them and there were some things in other shows that would have been nice to see again but this was action packed and well worth coming to the show."
0,This location was filthy and disgusting today!   When I tried clothes on the floor was so dirty I had to clean my feet before I could put my shoes back on.   The restroom trash was full of dirty diapers that smelled aweful.   I was there at 9am right when they opened so it's not like they had been busy all day.   There was trash all over the floor by the fitting rooms.  I was really disappointed.
2,"We had a WONDERFUL a lunch at the Rawhide steakhouse Sunday!  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  The food and as delicious.\n\nThe reason for only 3 stars, you ask??\n\nThe WHOLE reason we paid $5 to park our car in the nearly empty lot?  Our college daughter was home and we were all healthy and available to take a family photo at the Old Fashioned Photo place where you all dress up in period clothing...\n\nWe walked in, ready to take our family photo and we were the ONLY ones in the shop! Streets had maybe 3 other people wandering around. BUT no one in the photo shop except us, Santa Claus, and at least 2 employees standing there.  We asked to be photographed.  They say they were only doing Santa photos, not historical photos.  Of course we could see all the period clothing hanging right there on the wall...Again, NO other customers anywhere...\n\nThey said they only did period photos by appointment.  Could we get an appointment, we asked?  No.  No appointments available today.  Hello...???\n\nNo \""I'm so sorry Ma'am.\"", no \""Very sorry for the inconvenience...\"" We had planned to have these photos as presents for the grandparents this year.  I'm sure would have spent a good amount of money in that shop if ONLY they had accommodated us. NOTHING!!! Customer service completely lacking!!!\n\nNo where on the website does it mention that the photo shop had any change in the type of photos taken!  I checked before getting the family dressed and out the door.  Getting my 17 yr old son and my 20 yr old daughter motivated, showered, dressed and out the door for a photo is hard enough without getting there and having a complete let down waste of time.\n\nTo say I am disappointed is an understatement!  The 3 stars are NOT for the photo people, they only belong to the staff of the steakhouse for good service and for the nice girl in the candy shop.\n\nI will find another place for our photos and I will be sure to let everyone else know about my experience."
1,"I must first state that I was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. \n\nI must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. \n\nFirst, the food: My trusty companion and I each had a burger. I had the flagship \""Gold Standard\"" and she had the \""El Machete\"". \n\nThe Gold Standard is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar and arugula. This should be delicious, and I assume if seasoned properly it is. Unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... I LOVE SALT - which left the Gold Standard feeling merely Standard. \n\nMy Tardis companion had the \""El Machete\"" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. This was actually delicious from the two bites I had. If there was any seasoning issue with the burger itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!\n\nAlong with that we had regular fries and sweet potato fries. The fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. The sweet potato fries were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. \n\nWe also had milkshakes. Hers being some fruit compote Fourth of July special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. Mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (I had asked for chocolate ice cream but I wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)\n\nAs we left, I thought \""unspectacular... but worth a second look\"".  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I figured that I might try it again when next in town. \n\nNot long after my companion and I started feeling sour in our stomachs. Come dinner time, still sour... I have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. Even as I write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.\n\nWe tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. It literally went into the box the same way it came to the table. \n\nI really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. I would like to think this is an isolated incident in which I suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. \n\nI really wanted to like this place. The menu is creative.  The decor is attractive. There are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  Unfortunately, I went from \""looking forward to eating there\"" to \""pondering a second chance\"" to \""likely not looking forward to a future visit\""... \n\nIf not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way I feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. So in fairness, I decided to average the two opinions. \n\nAll in all a very disappointing visit. Thank god for Pepto."
0,"..............see a pattern here, it seems that all who post, say the same thing!!  Wake up GlobalTranz.\n\nIf i could rate zero stars I would.  These guys are the classic bait and switch type trucking that your mama warned you about.  You can give them the weight, dims and commodity and they'll send you a bill for 2x-3x more and tell you that the class changed without explanation.  We had or quote in writing, so we send a copy with our payment honoring the quote, but not paying the 3X amount.  They had an attorney contact us and threaten to sue us over $1000..........can you imagine.  The founder and principle so i'm told is Mike Leto (mleto@globaltranz.com) but he's useless as he's the guy who profits from the unscrupulous work ethics.  Run away.  EFreight is much better on line internet broker for freight and they honor their quotes."
1,"I don't think that it quite lived up to the hype...might have been because I ordered take-out or ordered the wrong thing? I got the Drunken Noodles and it was incredibly greasy...It also tasted a bit bland...Also wasn't the most authentic.\nMaybe their noodle soups are better? I do have to say that it is very affordable, though."
2,"This mall is a bit confusing to me, so many turns and SOOO LONG! But the design here is very chic and attractive. The stores are never-ending...especially when you are walking with heels...Thankfully there are lots of seats everywhere...BREAK TIME! =)"
4,"Thie is our favorite place to dine in Anthem. The menu has plenty oaf variety, from. Lighter more casual fare to full special dinners. The wine list is really good and not too overpriced. It's our go to restaurant for a nice meal out."
0,Sandwiches are average. Had a BLT with avo. Very two small slithers of avo. I expect more for a $7.50 sandwich.  Cookies good. Not much to right home about.
4,I love this place! Alex was helpful and honest. I will definitely be back and recommend to all my friends.
0,"We were looking at the little tear drop \""Five-Wide\"" trailer. A friend has one and we covet it every time we see it.  We found one on RV Rental Outlet's website and after three calls connected with someone to talk to.  The price on the web is $165/weekend, but the online booking tool calculates it as $165/night.  The very pleasant person on the phone quotes the price of $165 for the weekend but added a $29 \""prep\"" fee.  And of course tax.  The prep fee is not optional, so the real price is $195.   \n\nThis deceptive pricing infuriates me; if they lie in their advertising, what else do they lie about? We won't be renting or buying from this outfit."
1,"My boyfriend and I had went in for dinner and was not pleased at all. Instead of going to our usual spots for Mexican food like Blanco, LA Fonda Del Sol and Z'tejas, we decided to try somewhere new. I hoped that this little joint would be awesome but within 10 minutes of arriving, I lost hope. We sat, got our menus, ordered our drinks and received our drinks. 10...15 minutes later, no one had come to our table to take our order. I got up to ask who our server was. We got an apology and our new server was really nice but it did not make up for how bad the food was. I ordered the Chile relleno and it was pretty much a soggy bell pepper with cheese that was drenched with the same salsa they served with the chips. It just looked like a sad dinner. Not worth the money... Boyfriend ordered the enchiladas - no bueno. But the drinks were good! They took care of the first round of drinks to make up for forgetting us but nothing makes me want to go back. But we tried!"
3,"This is very good upscale Mexican food.  My only problem is I find it hard to swallow $20 - $30 for a plate of Mexican food.  I know it is very good quality, but I feel for that kind of money I could have a better experience elsewhere.  If the price doesn't bother you, then by all means, it is very good."
0,"Be careful. The so-called security deposits are listed as \""fees\"" in the rental contract. When I signed the contract, they told me they were refundable and non-refundable deposits. When I'm moved out, they sent me a cleaning bill and stated none of it was being covered by my deposit, because according to the contract, there is no deposit. My $100 refundable deposit and $350 non-refundable deposit were all up-front fees."
4,"Nice little spot with friendly staff, good music and great pizza. Had the Rustica and the pepperoni pizza. Both were really friggin good! \nAlso had tiramisu for dessert that was absolutely decadent. Food here is fantastic, hands down."
3,"For whatever reason, last night, I had a HUGE craving for some Cafe Rio Barbacoa Nachos.  I have only had them twice before so I don't know why/how this strong craving came about.  Granted, the nachos are freaking delicious and are definitely some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Still, it's a random craving to have out of nowhere.   I Yelped Cafe Rio and found out that there was one semi close to my house.  Guess where I went to lunch today?  Yup........nacho, nacho man......I want to be, a nacho man!\n\nRolled down here and got in line and placed my order for my pork barbacoa nachos.  Whenever you order nachos, the staff sings the nacho man song.  Its pretty funny yet a bit uncomfortable to hear all of them bust out a tune while making your food.  Anyways.......I got mine topped with  all the usual stuff (pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, black beans,  Dr. Pepper soaked pork barbocoa).   Total for nachos and a drink was a little over $11.50.  Here is how they were.................\n\nPork Barbacoa Nachos-  These things are possibly the best order of nachos out there.  They pile a grip of tortilla chips into a little tin foil container.  They then top your chips with a grip of cheese and meat of your choice.  They send it through a little conveyor belt to melt the cheese and then load it up with the other toppings mentioned in my previous paragraph ;-).  Everything works well.  The sweetness of the pork barbacoa, the crispy chips, the stringy cheese and the heartiness of the black beans all blend together perfectly.  They are a bit skimp on the guacamole and sour cream but they still give you enough to mix it around a bit.  Overall, they are just excellent nachos...some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Oh yeah, they serve Coke products which is sweet!  \n\nOnce again, I was very impressed.  I have not had anything else from here, and doubt I will ever get anything else from here besides the nachos.  Stick with a winner, right?  These nachos are fantastic and are a must order every single time!  Trust me ;-)"
2,"Service was excellent; ordered chicken with basil and chilis; green papaya salad and seafood spagetti.  Stir fried chicken with basil was really excellent.  The papaya salad was incredibly small for the $9 price.  Really, the restaurant can do better.  Spagetti was so-so.  But, I can see why the restaurant has a lot of fans.  We arrived before Monday night opening, and there was already a line.  Wasn't my cup of tea."
0,WORST! BAD COMPANY!!! Customer services really sucks and the operator is really rude! She has a major bitchy attitude and you could tell by the phone she hates her job.
1,We don't have Jack in the Box on the East Coast.  I'm glad we don't if this is the norm.   Service was totally disorganized.  And no internet.  Food was ok though.
3,"I am a pho fan and theirs is more than fair! Flavorful spring rolls with peanut sauce, tender orange chicken, and a delicious house-made coconut water!\nGo and enjoy!"
2,"I came here as part of a large party (approximately 50 people).  The restaurant was convenient to the hotel.  It was nicely decorated but he space was VERY loud.  I can't stand this in restaurants.  Especially if one is conducting business.  \n\nThe servers were very accommodating.  I enjoyed their hospitality.  They brought out a perfect Guinness.  They were always ready with refills and suggestions.  We were provided with some very good bruschetta and even better chicken pesto kabobs while we waited for the entres.\n\nBut here is the rub.  We had a limited menu with 5 selections.  It took almost 90 minutes to get our food.  They had several other parties.  I do not know why they did not have additional staff.  But this is pretty inexcusable.  \n\nI will say that the scallops were exquisite!  They melted in your mouth.  The corn grits were also delicious although there could have been more grits on the plate.  Come on folks grits are $2 for a tractor trailer load.  How about an adult 3/4 cup portion?  \n\nFinally, they had some unidentified green on the scallops.  It did nothing for the meal except remind me of baling hay in high school.  This did remind me that I went to school to pay prices like these!?!"
0,"I love this place but this time around it treated me very wrong , Came there with a group of 12 had 5 rooms rented 4 of us showed up at 2pm and the rest of our party showed up at 9;45 pm . the room was under our friends name who attends this hotel often and even with him on the phone verifying who he was and giving us permission to enter a room ( we offered a credit card) would not let us check in. we had to purchase another room and told that when our hosts arrived that we would be refunded our money likely!!! Because we had reserved so many rooms and just transferred to there bill. Not the case at all we were not allowed to check our bags because we were not the renters on the agreement. So we rented a room to change in thinking that we would just stay in the room when our hosts arrived at the rate arranged per our hosts... Not the case charged full price and treated very rudely when trying to organize the chaos. we werent looking for a free place just to check in an hour early. we had the host on the phone with the manager giving us permission to check in with credit card used to reserve the rooms(also a vip player by there standards) and still we were forced to rent another room on top the 5 we reserved . I gotta say i love this property but we were here for a good time and i spent the first 3 hrs of my vacation bickering back and forth with front desk. Then when our hosts arrived we spent another 45 minutes with vip services and they flat out said sorry do you want the rooms you reserved or not...i know it was a busy weekend i understand we were there to have a good time we werent rude due to most of us being in the service industry we just wanted to have fun and enjoy our surroundings at a price we had agreed upon.... We were treated poorly and it totally bums me out because we have had so much fun here in the past. our group of 12 spent a significant amount of money here AGAIN!!!! But i think in the future we will look elsewhere due to the fake promises and outlandish rules"
1,"I want to say that I kept an open mind. The atmosphere is very comfy and warm. We wanted to give Viva Mercados another chance as we ate there a few years back and the quality was not good. My experience is this...\nthe ceviche is wonderful but the salsa is very watered down and the beans are not fresh. The fideo soup was good. I ordered a corona light and it took a long time to get it, lets say our entrees came out first. My husbands drink was mountain dew and they refilled it 3 times with water. I never like ice tea nor water as most people don't know it sits. The A grade was not visible,  very questionable about temps and cleanliness.\nMe and my husband ordered fajitas and they were overdone and not sizzling and worse is that the meat was very chewy and our rice was not hot. We got a new one remade that was better with more broth and it came out sizzling this time but the rice was not hot again. The albondiga soup I took home was not good. The albondigas fell apart and it looked like minestrone soup, I threw it away. Now, the churros are excellent!!! I work in the F & B industry and I hate sending food back but as a paying customer I was disappointed and have a right. I personally feel it is overpriced for the dining experience."
4,Very pleased with the whole experience. We stopped by to make an appointment for an oil change and the owners introduced themselves and  greeted my wife and I. I am a firm believer that a handshake speaks a thousand words.  These guys were very thorough in the inspection of my truck pointed out that I don't have many more months left on my battery. Blessed to have them so close to our new house.
2,"The service here was terrible.  Multiple waiters not knowing what each of them is doing.   However, the food WAS pretty good.  But don't go here if you are really hungry, the portions are quite small.  The view is really nice and the overall atmosphere was great.  They just need to get better at waiting on tables."
1,"This is your average sushi place. Sushi rolls can go anywhere from $4 to $9 and they're of fairly average quality. I ended up getting a lunch special with two rolls of sushi with miso soup. The pre-made miso soup is poured into a bowl, and then they take tofu squares from some sort of refrigerator and drop them into the soup; I found that odd. The service was pretty friendly too.\n\nThe bento boxes can be underwhelming at times. For instance, I ordered a bulgogi bento box and I got more onions than bulgogi in it."
1,"Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?\n\nI tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced.\nI'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.\n\nIn terms of service, one waiter was really nice but we were passed around to different waiters and I can't say that the others were helpful at all.\n\nMy recommendation would be - don't eat here."
1,Great place for happy hour! Appetizers are ok!
0,"I've lived in the Foothills for the past 18 years of my life. I've been going to this store to purchase stamps/envelopes for years, especially since they stay open a couple hours later than the post office. That is literally the only good thing I can say about this place. My main concern is with the owner (or whoever the man is who has been constantly working there all these years). He's always been very rude to me and I really cannot determine why. I suppose when I was younger (a teenager) he could have used my age as an excuse to treat me like complete garbage--I understand a lot of people want kids in and out ASAP. Fine. Fast forward about 10 years.. I'm now 23 and have gone back a couple times recently and received the same awful service, if not WORSE. \n\nFor starters, this guy seems to hide in the back of the store so even if I did need assistance, I'd have to go searching for him to get it. What really bothers me though is that the past two times I have gone here I have gathered the things I need, gone to the register, rang the bell for service, waited, rang the bell again, waited. Both times I stepped over a few feet and saw him scrolling down a webpage on his computer. No, he wasn't on the phone. No, he wasn't actively typing an email/placing an order or anything. He was scrolling down a list (similar to eBay, Amazon). Both times I rang the bell for a THIRD time before he begrudgingly got up and was \""forced\"" to help me.\n\nDespite his unwillingness to help and miserable attitude, I always try to remain friendly (and honestly just GTFO as soon as I can because I hate this place). The second time I went and had this same horrible experience in two months, I was a bit frustrated. As I paid for my stamp and envelope, I was digging change out of my wallet and kept pulling out nickels instead of quarters. I quietly grunted to myself, expressing mild frustration, already annoyed at having to ring the bell THREE times just to get him to get off his computer. When I expressed annoyance (at MYSELF, mind you, not even looking at him) he gets all defensive and angrily and says \""What? WHAT?!\"" and snatches my money from me when I present it. As if that frustration was directed at him--which it wasn't. But immediately after that I vowed never to give this a******* my money again. \n\nLong story short: the owner/operator of this establishment has treated me poorly for years now. I may be the stupid one for continuously going back in, but I honestly thought that \""Hey maybe this guy was just having a bad day, I'll just run in and grab my stamps\"" and literally have had a horrible experience every single time. \n\nThere's a piece of paper taped on the counter that says \""Comments and criticisms are welcome\"" which makes me wonder if other people have complained about his God awful customer service. My mom and brother have the same opinion of him, as he also likes to sit on the computer and ignore the bell ringing whenever we need help. \n\nIf you can make it to the post office in time, spare yourself the misery and don't go here."
3,"Not only do I love to find good food but I also love to cook good food. I've been to many William-Sonomas in my lifetime, but this one always seems so warm and friendly. I ran in the other day to pick up a few things and wound up with a list of classes coming up. Not only do they offer FREE classes but they are on Sundays. How fantastic is that? For those of us in  the city that have regular jobs, it's hard to get to these weekly things that start at 5-ish. Knowing that I can come in on Sunday after church makes me so there.\n\nThis store is a decent size. I've seen many bigger, but for some reason that seems to be the trend in Las Vegas. Everything is smaller accept the casinos. This location is at The District in Green Valley so on a nice day it's great to walk around or grab a bite somewhere.\n\nWhile I would prefer to go to Sur La Table, the idea of going into the Fashion Show mall makes me want to jump off the Stratosphere. If you want good kitchen equipment, this is a great store for quality items. Yes, it's a little pricey at times, but if you are like me, you want to pay for something that will LAST."
3,"had to hit up the wicked spoon again on our recent trip to vegas. but i have to admit, like sade says, \""its never as good as the first time\"". \n\nwe went to the breakfast buffet on a weekday this time so the menu might not be as great as maybe the saturday breakfast brunch we went to previously. i was sad there were no red velvet pancakes. sniff sniff. they only had regular buttermilk...which i guess were also good but it aint no red velvet thats for sure. maybe they only save that for the weekenders. the food selection was still huge but i couldnt find as many things to eat this time around as i did last time. altho im sure glad that the gelato was still there. you really cant go wrong with gelato first thing in the morning. \n\ni still love the wicked spoon and we will def come back but i think i might want to try the weekend breakfast brunch again to see if they bust out the more yummy food....like red velvet pancakes!"
4,"Great concept, Great food, Great Atmosphere...\n\nDamn Great store!"
0,"I had the worst experience ever at this place!!!!!\nService was horrible and the food was not great to make up for it either.\nI heard soooooo much about bubba gump shrimp and was always really excited to try it, and finally a group of friends and I did. Sadly the server we had was AWFUL!!!!!!!!! I had never in my life seen anyone hate his \""life/job\"" more than our server, he was talking to us like we were \""annoying him\"" for just being there it was ridicules. He would cut us off in the middle of ordering, and talk to the other waiters around him, and when we asked for recommendations he just simply told us \""that it all depends on what you like\"" in the tone of voice saying (just pick darn it!). \nThe food was not great and the portions were SMALLER than expected but the service did not help, it made us just want to get out of there, without even getting a dessert (this pretty much never happens in my book so its serious! lol) \nand when we finally got the bill he asked us to pick up everything off the table put it in the plates and pick it up and hand it to him, (if you ask me, he pretty much made us clear our own table for him! lol and we tipped him after! haha)\noverall horrible experience but gave for conversation at dinner and after! lol"
1,"Location is ok for the downtown area. Not too impressed though, and won't be in my top 3 choices for the future. \n\nHere's my list: \nPro's: \nLocation \nSelf-Park at the Greyhound Bus garage a block down the street (anywhere from $5-$13/day depending on weekday or weekend) \nWalkable to all sporting venues \nGreat restaurant across the street NOT associated with the hotel (Tonic) \nFantastic gym and indoor pool \n\nCon's: \nRack rate='spensive \nSelf park at hotel is $20/day, ouch, w/ no in and out \nRoom had a stink that didn't go away \nMaids like to knock to clean the rooms starting at 8 AM, and do so multiple times if you don't put the privacy sign out \nHotel staff not particularly nice as what you'd expect out of a Westin \nThe Fish Market (restaurant in the hotel) super 'spensive w/o great snack offerings, and again, not so nice service \nWalls are super thin- so much so that we had morning wakeup calls from our \""neighbor\"" hitting the head, gross \nBeing colocated with the convention center means lots of traffic around the hotel and lots of obnoxious people \n~~~~~ \nIs now when I mention that we got the place for $70/night on Priceline (4 star, you'll either get this or the Omni)? If you can deal with the above, then this is your place...if not, pay the rack rate somewhere else."
2,The portions are way too big.  I don't think a single person can eat the whole plate and it's absolutely ridiculous.  What a waste!!!!  I would rather have half the portion for half the price (very expensive).  I don't think I'll be going back.
0,"In Oct 2014 we shipped a package double boxed and packed with air pillows from The UPS Store 3590 on Val Vista in Gilbert, AZ.  We even have pictures from the company we shipped the headlights to that prove our packaging.  The box was damaged when it arrived at its destination. We bought and paid for insurance.  One headlight was broke during shipping and UPS is refusing to pay for the product saying that they didn't break it during shipping.  We have tried repeatedly to speak with the manager of The UPS Store 3590 but he is never there. He never returns our calls even though we have left the number numerous times. We have also emailed the store and UPS claims department with no success.  The claims department says that we have to reopen the claim with the store that we shipped from. We have physically stopped at The UPS Store 3590 on different days and times and are told the manager isn't there but try this day/time.  Again when we arrive he isn't there.  We insured the package for $800 and only asked for $450 to cover one headlight and shipping.  We are so upset that the manager won't help us or return calls.  If you use this store to ship be aware that they do not stand behind their insurance policy so it is a total waste of your money.  We will not use this UPS store again or recommend them to anyone needing to ship items."
2,"i would give this place 3.5 stars.  we had reservations here for sat night at 745 and weren't seated for about 15-20 minutes.  it was graduation wknd, so there were a ton of people.  when we were finally seated, we could only get seats at the bar, which was super loud.\n\nthe menu here is not big.  we started w/ the patatas and the bulgogi summer roll.  i thought it was weird that they had korean items on the menu, b/c there was also a korean hot pot dish that looked a bit like bibimbap.  the patatas were really good and smokey.\n\nfor my entree, i had the snapper w/ shitake mushrooms, edamame, and celery.  it was really light and asiany.  my brother's filet was huge, and my mom said her salmon was good.  my dad had the ratatouille w/ couscous, which was the smallest dish.  all the other portions were pretty hefty.  \n\nfor dessert, we got the tres leches cake, which was good, but i wished it was more drenched in milk.\n\nservice here is pretty fast considering it is packed and loud.  there were a ton of drinks on the menu and a bunch of beers on tap."
1,"I really don't like writing negative reviews but I was quite disappointed with The Maple Tree. I was excited to try this place after seeing it on Restaurant Impossible. If this is \""after\"" transformation, I wonder what the \""before\"" was like.\n\nEven though it doesn't  fit in with the Asian businesses in the shopping center, the interior is nice and quaint.  We went on a Sunday morning and were the only non-Senior citizens for some reason. Luckily they have high chairs so they are kid friendly.\n\nThey advertised the Monte Cristo sandwich on their window so I ordered that along with Red Velvet Pancakes. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak. We both got coffee and it tasted watered down. I didn't taste any Red Velvet in my pancakes. The Monte Cristo was interesting but nothing special. The Country Fried Steak was chewy and the batter wasn't sticking and wasn't flavorful at all. Their famous apple fritter was hard and didn't taste fresh. I has high hopes that I would like at least one thing we ordered since we ordered a lot of items; however we didn't like a single one of them.\n\nAlbeit the tasteless food, the service was good. The hostess and servers were friendly and attentive. \n\nI was surprised to learn that they have two other locations in town which makes me wonder how they survive with mediocre food. Sadly, I will not be back."
3,"Brunch based review follows...\n\nJalepeno cheddar biscuits and gravy! Don't order it a la carte. Just go to the $24 buffet and grab it off the counter and then also eat their delicious crispy perfectly sliced bacon, french toast, and crepes. Even though the buffet did not include mimosas, Stone Grill had quite the variety of breakfast foods and made my hubby quite happy. \n\nI ordered... Well, big surprise, the Huevos Rancheros. I loved their ranchero sauce - very flavorful and even on the medium spicy side, so perfect for me! I was afraid it wouldn't be enough when I first got it because the eggs hid everything, but underneath the eggs was my crispy fried tortillas and black beans and oodles of ranchero sauce. One thing that was missing was avocado. Since the waiter asked if there was anything we needed, I asked for avocados! They came out with huge slices of avocado and didn't even charge us for it. I know you're thinking, \""Big deal, no charge for avocado,\"" but if you go to Chipotle or even Subway, you get charged extra for avocados or guacamole. Stonegrill gets kudos for appeasing my need for avocados. \n\nThey also gave me a little taster of yogurt with freshly sliced mango when waiting for my food. They are now on my list for great breakfasts!"
0,"Last night I had the misfortune to take my sister-in-law, 15 & 17 year old niece & nephew to Castle Vampire and Gates of Hell.  I had gone to Castle Vampire twice in years past and enjoyed it as creative and fun haunted house. This year Castle Vampire seemed stale and somewhat run down.  Part way through there is a door sill that is about 12-16 inches high that you must step over in the dark, well my nice fell over it onto her face. There was also a new more negative and abrasive attitude with the costumed entrance greeters. Gates of Hell was a totally uncreative, not scary but simply rude and abusive experience; there is nothing scary about being rudely shoved forward and yelled at. Shortly into it we came to an area where we were repeatedly provided stinging electrical shocks which is when I used the failsafe word to free my family from this inappropriate abuse. Of course they rip you off by stating there is no refund if you use the failsafe word. My only regret is I didn't walk away with my family prior to entering the structure when the greeter was using the F bomb and other lewd and inappropriate language.  These attractions have lost all of the creativity that could provide a scary, fun, family appropriate Halloween experience. This business is no longer family appropriate and is cutting corners to simply make money. Save your money and avoid this cheap, abusive & trashy experience. I think the word is getting around as there was a very small number of people attending the attraction."
3,"We heard about this place from a Guardian list of top cheap eats in Edinburgh, so stopped in for a quick lunch after a morning of walking.  Not too busy when they first opened on Saturday, but I think they get very busy in the evenings.  \n\nWe both wanted noodle soup, but felt we had to try the yakitori, as that is their speciality.  So we started by sharing the Tsukune, which were amazing chicken meatballs.  One order gave us each one little skewer of three, so we got a good taste.  The sauce that glazed them was homemade, and really unique.  Made us want to go home and google it and try to figure out the recipe!  Then we each got ramen, mine with gyoza dumplings and his with tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet).  I preferred the dumplings, as the pork had a sauce on it that I didn't think worked well with the broth.  Other than that, the dish reminded me a lot of Wagamama only better - lots of yummy seaweed and abundant vegetables like carrots and leeks.  One soft egg in each bowl, and lots of curly ramen noodles.  \u00a310 for a bowl, so not the cheapest, but the ramen is great quality and felt very authentic).  It's a casual but sleek little place, a little too cold in there though!  Very convenient location for a meal after doing touristy things all day.  Definitely don't miss out on the meatballs!"
3,"This is a review about a play in their showroom. Tonight we saw a production from the Jewish Repetory Theatre of \""Love Letters\"" performed by Loni Anderson and Hal Linden. They were excellent individually and together reading letters sent between two \""Waspy New England\"" friends from well-to-do families over a 50 year span of time. Plot was predictable.  It was the performances from these veteran actors that was awesome. Bravo !!!"
3,"Love love love pink! Better than Patty's Closet, hands down. If you're looking for a one time outfit to wear, this is the place to come. Affordable, chic and stylish. Don't be caught wearing the same dress at the club ;P"
2,"Dined here a few times for breakfast and lunch. Nothing to be too impressed by. The food is generally greasy, the tables dirty, and the service definitely lack-luster. \n\nThe only reason I went in the first place was because my friend bragged about how awesome the place was. I left unimpressed."
3,"Komol is definitely on my weekly lunch rotation. I really enjoy the chicken Indian curry, pad Thai, and pad see ew. The herbal salad is also great! The employees are very nice, however service can be inconsistent. It seems that during dinner time it can take quite a while for your food to come out. Also, the spice level can be inconsistent as well. I opt for mild to medium in spice which can range from \""hey where's the spice?\"" To \""OMG my lips are burning!\"" So now I stick to saying mild to play it safe. \nThis place has a great vegetarian menu as well and all of those dishes are delicious too. \nDefinitely a restaurant that you should try. Also, get the Thai iced tea with coconut milk...amazing!"
1,Slightly below average place. Would only eat lunch here.Food is average at best. Have never actually seen a chinese person at this resteraunt. Seating is very tight as they are trying to fit 30 tables into a place that should only have 15-20.
4,"I would give Komol 10 starts of they had that option.  For vegetarians and others alike I cannot praise this place enough. Food out of this world,  portions large and great value.  This will be one of our regular on every trip to Vegas."
0,"They washed the floors while we were eating.\n\nWe stopped here at 7 on a Saturday night. I was not impressed. Their chips and salsa were some of the worst that I have ever tasted. Their burrito was average. The worst thing was as we were finishing our meal, someone came and mopped the floor next to us. This was not a spill but the nightly cleaning. The smell of Lysol was a little overpowering. I am all for cleanliness, but do it after you are closed, not while people are eating. Since we were almost finished, we left what we had remaining on our plates, paid the check and left."
2,"Decided to check this place out for lunch yesterday. The decorations were very modern and I really liked the outdoor atrium you can eat in. I ordered a burger and wifey had the Hot chick sandwich. My burger was good, nothing to write home about but good. The wife enjoyed her sandwich, all though she overlooked the fact that the guacamole was spicy. I think this could be a great place to come and get some wine and appetizers, looking forward to coming back on the weekend! Late open kitchen is a bonus!"
4,"As Gold Club members, we are pleased with the service provided to us at Hertz McCarran Airport. Wayne was especially helpful as he offerred to bring us to the airport instead of catching the shuttle. Thanks Wayne! \n\nWe rented the Mercedes C250......nice car.........drives well..........but a little small. No problems. We'll use Hertz again."
1,"The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints."
4,Just tried Pio Pio today and HAD to sign up to give them a great review! This place is AMAZING!!! We(the bf and I) stumbled across it while walking from freedom park we were originally going to try big daddy's but decided to keep on walking a little to see what else was in the area. I'm SO glad we stopped when we did. \nWe decided to sit outside and ordered a whole chicken ( not knowing how huge the portion was going to be) for 9 bucks! A whole chicken= $9 i mean c'mon that's a freakin steal. Not to mention this is the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte! It was perfect! Juicy just enough spices nothing overpowering. These ppl are true artists! We also ordered a side of rice and beans( yum just like mami used to make) maduros( sweet plantains) and a chicken empanada. My bf ordered the mango juice which was outta this world! It's making my mouth water just thinking about the feast we had. Oh and I had the inka cola:)\nI really hope this place gets good business and stays open. The service was fabulous! They were so attentive but not overbearing. What can I say this place was PERFECT! I have to tell everyone I know to stop in to make sure this place stays open so you do the same:)\n\nP.S. I almost forgot about the garlic sauce....OMG if you don't try anything just ask for some sauce. YUM!!!
3,"I had the delicious chicken club avocado meal. I like how the options for sides aren't just chips, but potato salad, macaroni salad and grapes too! My sandwich was wonderful. I would give them 5 stars but I've only had one thing off the menu so far so who knows. I got a side of their house dressing to dip my sandwich in. Really good."
0,"Hmmmmm, multiple employees and no one wanted to help, we finally received help and she tried really hard but was unsure of what was what and had to keep asking other workers (who didn't want to help her).  Not the place to go when buying gas long inserts and custom surrounds!"
1,"Great location - I had a conference at Caesars. and it's right \""next door\"" which still entails lots of walking.  Beds very comfortable and the windows open!\n\nOur problem began with the fact that they gave us a room on the strip side.  9th floor.  We had our windows open, and it was quiet till about 1 a.m., when there were strains of rock music till day break.  (I'm a child of the 60's and I can deal with the music, but not through the night!)  The next night, we just kept the window closed, but could still hear it.    Sure, sure, I know I could've used my ear plugs which I always carry.  We then asked to change rooms.  During the phone conversation there was no apology or even questions about why we wanted to move.  At the front desk, when we mentioned our problem with the room, again, no eye contact, no apology.  We had been using a roll away - they rolled it into the new room, but left it standing on end - didn't set it up as they did the first time.  Do you know how heavy those are?  It took 3 of us to position it and lower it to the floor.\n\nJust dinging them on customer service - also not enough towels and no bath mat.  Next time I'll go back to Caesars."
1,"As usual a friend and I were feeling hungry so we decided to go to Ra for a quick bite to eat. It was New Years Eve and the restaurant was pretty busy at around 9pm. There weren't any tables available so the hostess offered us a seat us at the sushi bar. Seeing it as I work at a sushi restaurant myself and knowing how difficult it is to seat the sushi bar i agreed and she showed us the way. This is where it gets confusing. When we got to the sushi bar she just stood there and I had to ask her if we could just sit anywhere or if she had a specific spot where she wanted us to sit. She said we could sit anywhere but then motioned to two empty seats in front of her. Assuming that's where she wanted us to sit, we took a seat. That's when I noticed that the spot where she sat us had been dirty. Soy sauce was on the table. There were no set ups, a random plate off to the side, etc. Before she left I called her over and said excuse me miss, there's soy sauce on the table (implying the spot was dirty) she said oh, went to wipe it down and just left. She didn't give us set ups, nor did she take away the dirty dishes on top of the bar. I remember there was 2 hostesses. I didn't catch either of their names but it def wasn't the taller blonde one. \n\nOur server was nice, for the two whole minutes he was around but didn't really come back after that.\n\nOur sushi was mediocre as Ra sushi tends to be. We didn't order much but my sashimi was a bit tough and chewy."
2,"Okay my review is a little biased because of the awful service we received. First let me say i have been to grand lux in houston several times, the food is delicious, low prices and the portions are huge. It was also highly convenient, open 24 hrs and in my hotel the Venetian right next to the casino tables, whats there not to love right...the service it was awful during the day, we waited over an hr for a turkey sandwich, no apologies from the manager it was like this was a normal thing i am very dissapointed at this level of service....i will only order to go next time."
0,"Dr. Fishell at Advanced Pain care is an insult to what being a medical provider means. The business itself states \""ADVANCED PAINCARE\"" A spine specialist sent him a referral so as to control my pain. I never heard back, I followed up with leaving one message after another and finally I was told to go see another doctor. Two weeks of waiting in pain to be told that is beyond unprofessional. \n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID if you care about yourself AVOID.\n\nAfter reading other reviews about Dr. Michael Fishell I am glad I never got in. For example:\n\nDoctor Fishell gave me the injection in my lower back (the wrong place) it was suppose to be in my neck, got very sick from the anesthetic. My husband called office several times that day, no One would answer the phone or called him back. Met with Doctor Fishell a week later, and he blamed me for all of his mistakes. All I can say is Beware of this Doctor. PS Some how he got a MRI I had on my back 5 years earlier. Said this was the only report he had. Why would a Doctor use an MRI dated 5 years ago\n\nand \n\nThis MD should be run out of the medical field. He was only interested in me as a patient if I had surgical procedures or injections. He put me on oxycontin and vicodin just to get rid of me. He set a follow up appointment and then rudely dismissed me saying there was nothing more he could do for me and that he could not spend anymore time with me. I would not recommend this doctor to treat my dog. I went to Dr. Joseph Imus who was horrified that I was taking the two most addictive drugs that would kill me if I kept taking them. He got me off of these highly addictive drugs and got me on celebrex and tramadol. I started feeling pain relief instantly. I can not say enough harsh comments about Dr. Fischell. He was awful. \n\nI love living in Nevada but horrendous medical practices I have observed or been a victim of in the little over 3 years I have lived here. A pain specialist should address any patient in pain, it is part of the Hippocratic Oath which states:\n\nI swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: \n\nI will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. \n\nI will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. \n\nI will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. \n\nI will not be ashamed to say \""I know not,\"" nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. \n\nI will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. \n\nI will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. \n\nI will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. \n\nI will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. \n\nIf I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.\n\nShame on you Dr. Michael Fishell you violate your oath and lack ethics and morality. Off to the medical boards I go."
1,"This place used to be REALLY REALLY REALLY good.  I'm not sure exactly what happened, but the food went WAY downhill!  While the portion sizes went lower and the prices went up, the quality of the food seems to have dropped as well as the expertise of cooking it.  \n\nThe Chicken Parm that I got was pathetic to say the least.  It was a tiny little piece of chicken breast and was dry as a bone.  The side of spaghetti was even small.  It almost looked like a children's portion as they set the plate in front of me.  \n\nMy wife and Dad both got the Mizithra Cheese...portion sizes were VERY noticeable between the 2 (She got a LOT more).  Sometimes you you get the Mitzithra Cheese with WAY more than you need...sometimes you get a lot less.  \n\nService:\n\nWell, it wasn't the best.  It took 20 minutes for anyone to come to the table...I had to go to the hostess and tell her that it's been 20 minutes and no one has even stopped by our table at all.  Once she showed up, it wasn't completely horrible.\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory used to be one of those places where you can go and meet up with the family for lunch/dinner and have good food as well as walk out of there full.  Their food used to be excellent and not taste like it came out of a microwave...or pre-cooked in bags like the Olive Garden."
3,We went to see Hypnotiq the show. Let me say it was too funny! The place is small but a great set up we were at a table up front. We had VIP open bar it was very cheap and best way to start off our Friday night in Vegas
2,"Is this place under new ownership?  It has new faces and the ambiance has changed.  The jazzy funky coffee shop feel is disappearing to oldies music.  The food and coffee is still the same, I just hope they don't install a big screen and show espn all day."
3,"Though this buffet may not be the largest, all of the food it offers is good quality.\n\nI've come twice, and both times I was very pleased. Instead of trying to ram all kinds of low quality food down your throat, they really try to serve the best. \n\nSeafood, a small section for Chinese food, meat station...Their omelet station in the mornings is amazing. Oh, and if you're looking for an ice cream/frozen yogurt section, they only offer cakes and pastries of all sorts. \n\nTry it out! Especially if you have the Buffet of Buffets pass because don't we already know you'll be stuffing your face at plenty of other places. Will it hurt to try one that doesn't boast itself on its overwhelming selections?"
1,"A client took me here today for a quick lunch.  He told me you have to try the wraps so I ordered a pizza lol.  I figure thats what they have plastered all over so it should be good.   The pizza was just oaky.  I think I can make a better pizza at home with buying some dough.  Homemade pizza is what it reminded me of.  If you want decent pizza try NY pizza on south  The wraps did look good though.  I should have listened, but im stubborn."
1,"Stumbled upon this place while in Vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  We thought \""hmmm...Bobby Flay?  OK I guess we will check it out.\""  \n\nAt the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for Bobby Flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  Perhaps the man can cook.  Plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nLesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely.  The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger.\n\nI ordered Sophie's chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  Because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  Check minus on service.  \n\nI wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nSide note - the bread basket had some decent items.  The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \""heat\"" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  Stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  I had a tequila/Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  I would say I expected more from Bobby Flay, but as I said above, he was just never really my style, so what I really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  Expectations met."
4,"Great coffee, great atmosphere, better employees! Be sure to get an iced drink during the summer, it can get a bit hot!"
4,"I love this place! We always make it a point to stop in at least once when we're in Vegas. I wish there was a cool pet store like this is LA! Although since exotic pets aren't legal in CA it probably wouldn't be too exciting, right?\n\nPet Kingdom USA always has tons of fun animals to look at from the exotic (short tailed opossums, ferrets, sugar gliders, monkeys & degus) to the not-so-exotic (puppies, kittens, bunnies & guinea pigs). The staff are normally always very nice, answering questions about all of the animals even though most patrons are tourists that don't make big purchases. \n\nTheir prices are very fair - I always pick up a dog toy or two here for my pups when I'm in town (you know Mom can't come empty handed!). Last time we stopped in I heard that they also have a link to a coupon for 10% off any animal on their website!\n\nThere are really only 2 exotic pet stores that I know of in Vegas - Pet Kingdom & Exotic Pets (over on Decatur) & Pet Kingdom wins between the two everyday. The cages are cleaner, it smells better & the staff are friendlier."
2,"Came here for apps and drinks...and both were tasty. \nI will say the service lacked a bit, often forgetting to bring things they said they would.\nThough the food was tasty, the portions were super small at a big price.\n\nI would give it a second shot, especially to see how dinner would be though."
3,"The service here is friendly and attentive and somehow remembers who I am every time I stay here. \n\nThe rooms are large, comfortable, and inexpensive. The TVs always have a bad picture no matter what Hyatt Place I am in, though. The Dallas location had the same annoying red static on the bottom of the screen that I have seen every time I get a room at this location. Not a big deal, however, as I don't go to Charlotte to watch TV.\n\nThere is food downstairs but don't bother. There are plenty of places just a few minutes away in NoDa, South Park, Ballantyne, etc."
0,"Had an awful experience at Fry's today. Stopped by to pick up a USB CD-ROM drive and a video capture device, and I noticed they now price matched online retailers. Used the Google Shopper app to find a better price for both, and went to customer \""service\"" to price match.\n\nThe first guy that \""helped\"" me had a hard time finding the first item, so after 10 minutes at another station, I walked over to help him find the item by (duh) searching for the item number rather than the description. Came right up.\n\nThen his manager needed to create an account on the site, which was very difficult for this senior staff member as they ask you tough questions like your phone number and email address! I saw him click through and fail like 7x so I asked him what it wasn't taking. He didn't know. I pointed out the RED BOLD ERROR at the top of the page that explained the problem, and lo and behold, that fixed it.\n\nOnly after waiting for 20 minutes did I find out that if they charged shipping that Fry's would only match to the total price. $15 shipping on that site killed the price match.\n\nWe moved on to the next item which I now pulled up to ensure their shipping charge was low enough to qualify. Unfortunately it was, so I'd be saving like $4 if I could make this price match go a little quicker. I walked the staff through as much as I could, but it was still taking awhile. I was running late now so I hinted that I'd have to leave soon.\n\nFINALLY I was brought over to a cashier with the new price quote, and it came up as \""pending.\"" The guy went back to his manager to fix it, so I asked the cashier staff where the store manager is.  They pointed at the guy that was \""helping\"" me that couldn't figure out how to create an account.  Great.\n\nA few minutes later the guy came back over and said the price quote should be working now.  The cashier punched in some numbers and said, \""Nope, still pending.\""  This is the point that I finally gave up and walked out of the store.\n\nSo, in summary, I spent almost an hour in the store... 15 minutes choosing my products and 45 minutes to try to price match to save a few dollars, and ultimately walking out empty-handed.  At least 4 different employees \""helped\"" me, including the store manager.  Yet somehow the end result was that my time was wasted, not to mention the employees time.  Surely this can't be how the owners of the Fry's corporation want their stores to operate, can it?"
1,"Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after 4 visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.\n\n1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.\n\n2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  \n\n3. Love dwntwn Phx.\n\nSo what could go wrong? \n\nService: \nNo one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the \""signature cocktails\"" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily \""Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now.\"" Yikes.\n\nBack to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.\n\nVibe:\nThe space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)\n\nThe Cocktails:\nThey look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. \n\nThe Food:\nEach time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. \n\nIn fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, \""gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water.\"" The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.\n\nForget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? \n\nSadly, no.\n\nAt each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)\n\nI'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) \n\nAs always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!\n\nSide note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)"
3,Not my favorite brewery in town but it was a pleasant experience. The beer selection is very good and the brews go down smoothly. Food was decent. Better than traditional bar food but far from great. Huge place could definitely accommodate a big party. Also a very nice patio.
3,My husband and I and our 2 year old son went last Friday.  The food and service were great! I wrote a blog post about it if you want to read more details:  http://crayonsanddrywall.com/2014/09/18/the-library-restaurant-review/
1,"The food was good. Prime rib was the best there. But, as the other reviewers mentioned this place lacks management. The lady behind the bar, Katelynn was VERY unprofessional. She had what appeared to be multiple groups of friends come and go as we ate. She gave them all unlimited drinks and seemed to be joining in the drinking with them. She flirted with men and I also heard her talking of going out after work with them. The cook was in view the entire time and seemed to be great at his job. Get rid of the corruption there and it would be perfect! Prices are decent too."
1,"I like their soup, but this was my first time having breakfast here.\n1. Too expensive. I spent $10 on a Breakfast Croissant and a coffee.\n2. I asked for a caf\u00e9 latte (double expresso shot, I know the coffee in the US is not very strong, usually). The coffee tasted like milk. It was like colored milk. I asked for an extra shot since I didn't like it. And it still tasted like milk, yuk. So, for me, this was  really bad coffee. I couldn't drink it. It ruined my morning, I love my coffee in the morning so much.\n3. The croissant was ok, but for the price it was not memorable."
2,"Dined at Joes for the first time on 12/20/2011.  Fantastic ambiance, my man told the staff it was my birthday and  the 2 of us got seated at a huge banquet with a view of it all.  The waiter was fantastic until about 1/2 way through when he forgot about us totally.  Even the couple next to us got fed up waiting for him and demanded their check from someone else, stood up in the dining room and waited for it, announcing their frustration.  That's the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 because the food was really wonderful.  I had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Chopped Seafood salad with Alaskan King Crab, Lobster and Shrimp.  Really generous seafood on the really yummy salad.  My man had the 16 oz ribeye which was cooked to perfection, he loved it.  The Key Lime Pie, top notch, maybe the best I've ever had outside of Miami.  \n\nDisappointment, no mention of happy birthday from our waiter, and no desert or anything special besides the good seating.\n\nDoes everyone come to Vegas and say it's their birthday?\n\nGo to Joe's for the food but the service, can't rely on it.  This is the slowest week of the year in Vegas....imagine when it's busy?"
0,"Poor selection with overpriced hair products. I could name a million other phx hair stores that blow this one out of the water when it comes to selection and pricing. Cute decor, but that's about it."
3,"The lounge OK ....\nWell one time years ago b4 YELP ..\nWe had a couple regular drinks  martinis goood my girlfriend never got I'd check well she is from Europe taller than me ...but younger ... \nI returned in a couple weeks with my cousin she just came to USA  her I'd was no good to them she was 24 at the time how ironic \nOther time I try to use my discover cc \nWE DO NOT!!!!

3,"I was delighted by the variety of the cuisine, as evidenced by the name of the restaurant itself. \nFor starters we had the plantains, probably the best part of the meal, that had sugar on them and were served with a delicious black bean pur\u00e9ed pesto.\nThe main dish was an Argentinian steak, which was a bit too well done to be considered rare, and was supposed to be accompanied by chimichurri, but alas wasn't.\nOverall, with a smart decor and a slightly above casual dress code, in addition to above average food, I'd be inclined to come back."
4,"I tried a few full service salons around the Dilworth/Southend area before finding Parvin...I have been getting waxed for a few years Brazilian (and have tried multiple places in the different locations I have lived) and Parvin is by far the best!  I haven't had any services as far as facials from her, but her waxing is top notch.  Minimal pain (for a Brazilian!) and is very quick!  She is so professional and is happy to answer any questions you may have.  This is the perfect place to go for your first (just make sure to tell her) or 100th waxing-  her pricing is great also- and tip is included in the cost.  by far the best waxing service I have found in the Charlotte area!"
3,"This is my favourite burger joint in town. I can order my burger rare and I can get a runny egg on it with their in-house aioli mayo and spicy Frat sauce and it's messy juicy bliss. (Their peameal bacon is nice and thick for when I want a heart-stopper.) Any time I've tried to get more fancy with the ingredients or tried the specials, I'm not as satisfied.  They have great specials every day and several decent beers (though nothing exciting on tap). Their onion rings are a guilty pleasure. I'm always up for a burger here."
1,"Even for strip prices this is out of control, you're getting crappy buffet style food and paying 5 star prices. Shame!! Casino's do not make their money in food and beverages.. $9 dollars for a 20 oz. Mountain Dew.. Call the police I need to file a robbery reports. If they made prices variable to actual store value and off the strip restaurant values, these casinos would be packed with locals and tourist alike. \nAgain where the box says Good For: Red, White and Gross gets \""nothing\"""
2,"Although everything was satisfactory, we expected a lot more. Maybe it's been too hyped up. \nThe 3 of us had\n\n1. Pork belly\n2. Duck\n3. Braised short rib\n4. Razor clams\n5. Scallops\n6. Tartar with Foie gras\n\nDrinks: Ceasar and bourban\n\nThe food was good, but for the price we paid, we expected it to blow our minds. The ceasars were ok, and the bourban wasn't good.  \n\nWe also booked (online) a month in advance and the only reservations available were for 530pm and 930pm. But during our entire meal 530-730pm, there were only 2 other tables and the restaurant only started to pick up as we were leaving. It sure would've been nice if we had been able to reserve a bit later considering the restaurant was basically empty.\n\nLike I said, everything was alright. and if it wasn't for the price, i might even come back."
3,Great park with lots of open spaces and amenities. Plus it has an amazing view. Being that it is in a residential area you really get a feel of safety and community unlike some of the other larger parks in town. \nThere's enough space to spread out from the rest of the people enjoying the day which is nice. I am not a fan of going to the park and feeling like I am spending time with a bunch of strangers. \nI also like that the park is kind of sunken down into the ground so on those windy days it kind of just blows over the fields.
0,"I have been here 3 times.  The big screen to watch sports on the back wall is faded and lacks color.  All the other TV's are decent. That's not why it gets 1 star.  The food!  Where do I start? This is a over-priced sports bar and the least expensive item on the menu (chips and salsa) are $6.00.  For the quality of food, the prices are way too high.  I am more than willingly to pay for these prices but the food is lacking appeal and often time I wonder if it comes out of the can.  The only special they had during the world cup was $3.00 Bloody Mary's.  It's not worth the price, lacks atmosphere, and poor quality food."
1,"My husband and I were looking for a quick drive thru for some Mexican food.  We drive by this almost daily and decided to try it.  \nMy husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  He stated he liked it...but it was a typical breakfast burrito.  I ordered the carne asada platter.  The meat was really tough.  The rice and beans were standard.  There wasn't any guacamole.  But the tortillas were really good.  \nWe thought we were going to be able to go thru the drive thru quickly, however, it took forever!  I don't see us going back because we like Laurita's on Maryland and Pebble much better."
3,"The sign \""SkinnyFATS\"" is tiny, it actually says \""ColdPressed Juice\"" or something like that. They have a good amount of seats but inside was full so we sat outside. It was much quieter and they have outdoor heaters too :) I ordered the Buff Chix and it came with truffle fries. It was good but not great. I think the buffalo sauce was a little too empowering and the chicken was pretty soaked in it. I also wish it was stacked on top of the fries cuz then my fries were soaked in buffalo sauce too. Other than that, the service was nice and the atmosphere was even better. I felt like I was in Cali or something lol. We need more hip places like this on the Southwest side."
2,"PJ and Duncan, Jazzy Jeff and the fresh prince and warren g and nate dog - 3 great double acts all totally butchered on our afternoon trip for karaoke! \n\nElectric Circus is right in the heart of backpacker district and it looks like it's definitely seen some serious action over the years. A place where nightclub meets fun palace - wipe down floors and a vibe and colour scheme so dark meaning there's no need to make an effort to dress up. \n\nAll of the above is cool though and makes it what it is! There were 10 of us crammed in a little box room and we belted out some absolute bangers. The staff were cool and friendly and I was surprised with what a good range of beers they had! Very cool\n\nI probably don't need to do karaoke every week but it was a nice one off and a bit of fun with good friends."
1,"I guess its not bad, we checked in and were given a smoking room because they had no others, we were not thrilled about that, but they said they were fully booked. After getting to the room I decided to call the front desk to ask if we could have a 12pm check out, I called from the room phone and after 15 minutes of no one answering I called from my cell phone as well and waited and finally someone answered after about 25 minutes, and they did let us check out at 12 but still if its pretty busy day I don't see how no one could have answered the phone a little quicker just to answer a quick question."
0,I have had my glasses for about 2 years. I have had to replace my lenses 3 times due to weird round like cracks. They look more like some film is coming off. I had to beg them to replace them the last time. Now it's doing it again. They said there is no film on them. Now they won't replace them again and I'm stuck with them and broke. Very frustrated!!!
4,I just love this store. I am so glad there is one on my side of town now. They have a rewards program thats pretty awesome. You should sign up. On your Bday they send ya a $10 gift card. I love any excuse to come into this store and a freebie is always nice. They do regular coupons online for $10 off $30 as well. The selection for wine is pretty good and I really love the european candy.
0,"I'm a fan of pizza but this place has some serious quality control issues. Last Saturday I ordered a supreme pizza for pick up. I went to the restaurant and stood at the counter for 10 minutes without being helped. Finally I asked the delivery driver on his way out the door if someone could help. He doesn't say anything to me turns around and sends someone out to help me. The cashier doesn't greet me or apologize for the wait just asks for my name. I get my pizza and go home open the box and take a slice out and notice its completely doughy, stretchy and not even close to being cooked. I am so pissed now. I call pizza hut and ask to speak to a manager,  I'm then told to hold then the phone call is disconnected. I call back and get the manager Josh this time and tell him the situation. Josh did apologize, I told him there's no way I'm coming back for another pizza or having one delivered covered in spit, I told him I wanted a refund. The manager did refund my money.  I ended up calling Papa John's to order a pizza, the team member was friendly and polite and my pizza arrived in 30 minutes and fully cooked and fresh. Papa John's delivery driver was also very polite and thanked me for my business. I will not being ordering from the Pizza Hut on Val Vista and Warner. Papa John's now has a new loyal customer!"
2,"Is it better than Chipukele?  Sure.  Is that saying much?  Not really. The best part about this place is their tortillas which are hand-made right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are delicious.\n\nI found the sweet pork to be WAY too sweet.  The shredded beef was OK.  The rice and pinto beans, IMO, were the best part.  I guess if I had to go to Chipotle, I'd pick this place, but if there was no gun to my head, it would be easy to forget about this establishment.  There wasn't really anything wrong with it, it's just there."
1,"The atmosphere is really cool, but the food is mediocre. I ordered the veggie pizza and friend got the BBQ platter with garlic fries. The best thing was the garlic fries. The pizza wasn't good and the BBQ was average. Next time I think I'll try a burger with the garlic fries."
2,"Not bad, Rok. Not bad at all.  \n\nPromoters were crawling around NY NY where we were staying, we didnt feel like paying for a cab, didnt feel like walking far, and first and foremost, didnt feel like paying to get in.  Our guy was named Guy, he was very nice and was where he said he would be, had us on the list, and got our guys in for only $10 each.  \n\nIt's not big, not fancy, but it doesnt really pretend to be either.  It's a rockish style of place.  Co-ed bathrooms, famous rock star stencils on the walls, good music if you are a mid 20's whitey like me. : P\n\nChampagne is free for the ladies from 10pm-Midnight. Score!  That was great. \n\nWhen we arrived around 10pm the dance floor was pretty much empty and people were just starting to get seated for bottle service, but that didnt last long, the ladies and i immediately started booty shaking and soon enough more and more people started in on the fun.  \n\nUnlike Haze they dont overcrowd the place.....or maybe they just arent as popular. But I'd take less popular any day over Haze, I like to at least be able to move my hips on the dancefloor and not get an elbow in the face. \n\nBouncers were nice, bartenders attentive, the crowd was older but I didnt mind; not really looking for any one-night-stand or meaningful relationship anyway. \n\nGood job."
3,"It was Restaurant Week, and at long last I was slated to step inside Todd's Unique Dining Restaurant and evaluate it for myself.  Our reservations were acknowledged and quickly honored, and not a moment too soon.  For, several parties arrived just after us.  The place was quickly packed with people and frantic servers.  But, initially, ours did not move fast enough.  Although our server said she would get us set with water and bread, she next took orders from an adjoining table of 11 diners instead.  When, after hailing a busser, our bread basket did finally arrive, it contained very good raisin bread but there was nothing special about the white bread.  The ambiance was homey but, as other Yelpers have previously noted, our straightback booth was rather cramped and uncomfortable.  \n\nA bowl of Cream of Heirloom Tomato Soup was very good.  Unusual Sweet Corn Ravioli tasted pretty good.  And, Grumpy's Salad turned out to be like a chopped wedge salad.  The medium-rare Filet Medallions I was served were excellent and buttery but very peppery, although I got used to the spice.  The Wild Mushroom Cabernet Sauce ladled under it tasted good.  So did Mashed Potatoes.  While a tomato on my plate was perfectly cooked, lengths of carrot served wild rabbit-style were too hard for my taste and julienned red beets accompanying Roast Prime Rib of Pork with Sausage Stuffing were undercooked.  I found Mexican Squash and Enoki Mushrooms to be pleasant but unremarkable.\n\nI thought \""Todd's\"" etched in cocoa powder was a nice visual touch next to a great-tasting Flourless Chocolate Cake with excellent Rasbperry and Vanilla Sauce.  The array of desserts (also Hazelnut Creme Brulee, Salted Butterscotch Pudding with fresh cream, and housemade ice cream) was the highlight of the meal.  While the food did not transport me, it and the overall experience were very good, and a return trip is likely in my future."
0,"I would give this place negative stars if that was possible!!! \n\nMOST HORRIBLE SERVICE EVER!!! DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM:  We purchased a RZR  900 Jagged X and a Honda TRX 700XX on October 16th.  We were lied to by the sales associate, the sales manager and the finance manager on multiple occasions.  Both of our units did not work and required serious repairs before they were operational.  Which the dealership attempted to have us pay for.  It took them a month to get the plates to us for the TRX700 and over two months later they still can't tell us where the plates for the RZR are or even if they have submitted for them.  their General manager is not returning our calls so we are posting our story every where we can.  Our review is much much longer with over 2 months of back and forth and having our units there on multiple occasions at times for 2 weeks.  We want help getting what we paid over $20,000 for."
3,"Baja Fresh, a nice, quick alternative to your local Taco Bell...  It is a restaurant that I have been to many times.\n\nPersonally, I love their quesadillas.  They are extremely cheesy, and they are filled with your choice of meat, with some Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa on the side.  Each one of the entrees have chips included.  Try some of their Salsa Verde with some cilantro... It's a very good combination.\n\nIf you really like their food, then buy their \""Collector Cup\"".  For $9.99, it includes 1 free drink, followed by 99 cent refills for life.  A good deal if you come back to this place multiple times.\n\nGood restaurant, good food, good place."
2,"The overpowering smell of garlic has gotten me a couple times. But once I walk into the old Speakeasy, you can't help but feel like you are in some Prohibitionary-style club. \n\nLive jazz music is just fab! Especially with their couches and laid back vibe, you can really get cozy here. I don't drink wine so I can't say how wonderful their selection is, although my wino friends are always giddy with excitement to come here and swish their glasses around."
1,"We were staying at the Elara Hilton Garden Vacations Club, which was located just around the corner from this restaurant within the mall.  One morning we were walking by with a little over an hour to spare and thought that we would dine here for breakfast.  There were only a few tables with patrons seated, so we figured we would be able to catch a quick coffee and meal for three under an hour.\n\nBig mistake.  Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.\n\nOur simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.  I wouldn't say that I'd be interested in coming back anytime soon.\n\n#100 / 100\nYelp 100 Review Challenge 2014"
0,"This place is horribly managed by a bunch of baboons.  They can't tell their right from their left.  I saw my waiter about 2-3 times the whole 2 hours I was there.  They have horrible service.  I had to wait for about 45 minutes to get my food.  WTF! It's only soup!  Noodles and soup!  We had talked to the manager about the horrible service and she did not do anything to compensate us, but instead told us a list of excuses.  It was also noticed that other parties were experiencing the same horrible service as we were\n\nBesides the horrid service, the food was decent at best.  Prices were very expensive for food that is so simple to make.  \n\nOverall this place made Treasure Island look very bad for lack of customer service.  If you don't want to risk waiting a long time for food, I would advise you to go elsewhere."
3,"What I Ate\n- Quick Start Loaded (4 eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast, and fruit)\n- glass of milk\n\nWould I Go Again?\nI really enjoyed my breakfast here, and I will probably go back in a few days.  The eggs were very good (two fried, two scrambled), the whole wheat toast had a great flavor with just the right amount of butter, and the fruit was fresh.  However, the highlight of the meal for me was the homestyle potatoes.  The edges were crisp, and they were cooked with red and green peppers which gave the potatoes a great flavor.  The only disappointment was the bacon, which I would classify as below-average bacon.  Maybe the chef had an off day.  The rest of the breakfast was so enjoyable that I am willing to give the chef a mulligan on the bacon.\n\nAdditionally, their outdoor seating was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast outside in Phoenix's beautiful November weather!"
3,"Las tortas ahogadas aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n buen\u00edsimas, se le acercan mucho a las originales de Guadalajara! LAS RECOMIENDO"
0,"Alright. I've been flippy floppy with these reviews on this restaurant. At first I loved it, then it just got worse and worse. \n\nThe price is just AMAZING! But sadly, everything else isn't. It took about 30 minutes for me to receive my first order. Every 10 mins, i tried remembering the young guy (with glasses) what I ordered, and he'd just say \""Yes, yes, its coming out\"", but it would never come out. Each order would take about 15-20 mins to get, even if it was just 2 orders of Hamachi Nigiri. The price makes me want to return over and over again, but when I think about it. I'm over paying. YES. I am overpaying. First off, they put a little more rice than they should, in combination to less fish, it also takes about 15 minutes for every little piece of sushi that I order. Typically, I can eat about 30 separate orders of Nigiri, in addition to about 3-4 rolls, but because it took so long for them to make it, I got full after eating just 10 orders of Nigiri and 2 rolls. That may sound like a lot, but in comparison of what i USUALLY eat, its very little. Typically, I like trying a wide array of different foods (squid, octopus, mackerel, salmon, tuna, salmon eggs, super white tuna, hamachi, etc), but because of the time I spent waiting, i only got to try 2 of what I usually get (salmon and super white tuna). \n\nDon't be fooled, even if they aren't busy, they still take just as long. I was sitting at the sushi bar, and I felt like I was last priority. While the people 2 chairs over on the same sushi bar, got everything they ordered within 7 mins (yes, I timed it). I do in fact have pictures of the food that I had (I'm an IGer, so I love posting pics of when I go out to eat), but sadly, I was just too embarrassed to post what I had ordered. \n\n\nOne thing this place can do to enhance the experience is (as rude as it sounds), fire the young sushi chef. Taking 30 minutes to prepare 5 orders of salmon and super white tuna is just ridiculous, and he only prepared it in the last 5 minutes of the 30 minute wait. I was just absolutely infuriated. If I had a choice, I wouldn't just walked right out of there without paying. Because I felt like I didn't get the service that I was going to pay for. Even when I was insistent and kind, asking if its almost done, he would constantly say yes, but id be stuck waiting another 10 mins. The things I order takes a maximum of 5 minutes to make. Its nothing that requires the oven, all thats needed is knife skills and rice and of course the fish (i mostly order nigiri). \n\nHeres how they can afford such a cheap price... \n\nThe longer you wait for each order, the fuller you get (it takes like 15 minutes for your stomach to send the necessary signals to the brain on how full you really are), the fish to rice ratio is completely off, instead of 1/2 rice to 1/2 fish, its more like 3/4 rice to 1/4 fish, and the staff purposely give you 'free samples' of menu items that you don't even want, then, if you don't eat it, you're charged extra. \n\nWill I go back? \nOnly if I am really craving my sushi fix. But whether or not they have 1 customer in there, or 100, it will take them forever to get your food ready and served. There were a few times that there were only 4 customers in there (including me) and it still took them 15 mins to make 4 orders of salmon and 4 orders of super white tuna. What were they busy doing? Having a complimentary glass of beer on tap (with their new beer on tap price included in the Deluxe price), laughing, joking around, and having a jolly good time. I'm all for having happy employees, but happy customers are a little more important ;D \n\nThis place seems to be under new management, but nothing has improved. Just an addition of an extremely charismatic manager/sushi chef. \n\nUsually going out to eat sushi is a fun, enjoyable experience. But here at Tokyo Sushi house, its an anxiety/anger filled experience as I am constantly waiting insane amount of time for some rolls and nigiri that are stuffed with rice and very little fish.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nGo here if you live close by and don't have another $25 to spare for another sushi restaurant. Don't expect speedy service. Only go here if you too need your sushi fix. Don't expect a ton of fish, expect the amount of fish to look wimpy, and the amount of rice to look hefty. Here, customers aren't number one, customers are second or third. \n\nIf Tokyo Sushi is reading this, My advice: \n\nFire the young sushi chef kid. He isnt experienced enough to make orders fast, neat and properly. It took him 30 mins before I got my 5 orders of salmon and super  white tuna and another 10 mins for 2 hawaiian rolls. The rolls themselves looked extremely poorly made, as if a 12 year old made it (an inexperienced 12 year old). get someone experienced, like that elderly man who was fired or quit. My family and I have brought your business a lot of customers (back in the day; we've actually brought you 20 returning customers who eat there every so often)"
0,"This buffet is GOOD and I still want to show them some love but after I found a SPIDER crawling in their beloved chocolate-covered strawberries (you know, the ones everyone writes about), it completely put me off and ruined my meal. Imagine taking a bite out of your strawberry, and then look down to see a spider drop down onto your plate from the strawberry you're holding. Pretty much a sure fire way to completely lose your appetite for the rest of the day.\n\nBut I think I was more put off by the way the manager handled the situation. The server sends over the manager who just stands there as I explain (I wasn't that annoyed, I was just trying to make them aware because no one wants to eat a damn spider). But then he just stands there, doesn't really say anything and makes it really awkward. Like....was I supposed to make a bigger fuss so I can get something comped? I think it was his really quiet demeanor and just standing there that made me think \""okay so....really, you don't know how to handle it\"". You could have just confidently told me you're sorry and will inform the staff about the issue. I think I was more put off by the clueless manager who didn't really know how to handle the situation. The other staff is great though.\n\nHopefully this was just a one-time occurrence but pretty sure I won't be going back for a long time. Bleh."
0,"Average food, which is strange for a fox restaurant. The service was just BAD!!! I had a margarita and after it was finished I put it at the end of the table as kind of a hint to ask if I wanted another, no go! After 6 pass by's from our waiter I walked to the bar to get it myself. My wife just had water and no offers to refill. After all that I talked to the manager and all I got was a \""that's not right\"" then the bill came and no compensation. Can you say One and done?"
2,"My mom and I were in the area and decided it was time for lunch.  Chilly out we felt like a soup and sandwich would hit the spot.  Trusty ol' Yelp gave me BC as an option.  When we arrived we looked and and were surprised to see how small it is in here.  The seating is tight and awkward.  It was too chilly and rainy to eat out doors so we made it work.  \n\nWe decided on the half sandwich and soup of the day special.  The sandwich of the day was a roast beef with a cream cheese spread that was supposed to have horseradish and we had 3 soup choices, Tortilla soup, tomato basil bisque and chicken veggie pesto pasta.  Mom decided on the tortilla soup and while I told the lady tomato bisque I was thinkin the chicken pasta...and typical as it is when I picked up my meal on the tray instead of the tomato bisque, they served me the chicken pasta.     \n\nThe soup was plentiful.  Mom made a meal of the soup (her's was heartier than mine) and saved her sandwich.  My soup was more brothy with a dollup of pesto and had frozen style mixed veggies and an assortment of canned beans and a few pieces of pasta (didn't see any chicken).  The sandwich was just ok, when mom had hers later she too was unimpressed.  \n\nWell this place was no Paradise Bakery but I like the opportunity to support small local business."
1,"Great way to stay cool, but nothing in here warms my heart. \n\nThis really is the run-of-the-mill standard yogurt shop...\n\n- Yes, they have multiple flavors of yogurt. Nothing mouthwatering.\n- Yes, they offer a lot of toppings, but so does the other yogurt shop around the corner.\n- Yes, It's brightly colored, but like a little kids bedroom. Weird. \n- Yes, the Disney channel is on the TV in this place. Which is a good way to make certain I won't stay here and enjoy my frozen treat. \n\nThe flavors were ok and the customer service was good, but U-Swirl is very forgettable. I'm not sure how to make yogurt shops more interesting, add alcohol and HBO?...Hmmmm. \n\nGood spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to indulge in some frozen sugar at U-Swirl."
1,"I suggest looking elsewhere for chiropractic care.  I was given a Groupon for services, but they didn't honor half of the treatments.  One of their schedulers advised that everything was fine, and another one told me that no future appointments could be honored.  The owner sided with the latter, and did nothing to make things right, or even marginally acceptable.  The two treatments I idid receive were acceptable, but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  This approach flows down from the top down throughout the organization.\n\nUpdated 5/5/13:\nBelow is the last email that the owner sent me prior to his leaving a comment to my Yelp review.  His approach of trying to discredit my review by insinuating that I was inappropriate to a female employee is a very creative and imaginative diversion.  Interesting that this tidbit was never brought up until after it became apparent that I wasn't going to remove my comment of his business.  The claim is not true, which is why he did offer me fulfillment of the remaining Groupon (see below).  By the time he came around to this, I thought it best for everyone if we did not pursue any further dealings.  My original review was factual. \n\nEmail dated 5/2/13\nHello Fred,\n\nI am disappointed that you would voice a negative comment on my office. I honestly believe that we performed a great service for you and treated you with the utmost respect. \nI was not siding with anyone but you have to understand that this is Groupons offer and not ours, so it really comes down to following their (Groupons) policies. \n\nI do apologize that my staff misinformed you on their policy and if an apology is not satisfactory to you then I guess you can go ahead and schedule your remaining groupon visits. \n\nThanks, \n\nJason Taylor"
1,So my husband and I pride ourselves in having tried or about to try almost every restaurant. We LOVE food and dine out as much as possible. This place intrigued me since the begining and had pretty good reviews. So we decided to go there for my B-day dinner (round 1). My husband made reservations and told them it was my b-day. We were seated right away. The menu looked good and the food was also really good...so why so few stars??\n\nMy husband aparently got up during dinner to make sure the waitress new about the special occasion and she told him they don't do anything. While that is def their decision I must say a dessert with a candle goes a long way for not much dough on the restuarants part. Not to mention the waitress Laren...who hardly ever remebered that she was our waitress never even wished me a happy b-day. All in all the service sucked which was a major factor in our mutual decision to never come back. She messed up our bill and was almost rude several times. The worst part was it was ridiculously hot the whole time.\n\nSave your money there are plenty of places to choose from...infact Cafe Boa accoss the way is 10 times better
2,Super yummy general tso's chicken! Nice people there as well.
0,"This used to be a great place to live until they switched up management. Natalie and Paki were always ON IT! They responded quickly and essentially catered to the needs of their residents. Ever since they have been replaced with Stephanie, things have gone down hill to put it nicely. A LOT has changed. They rarely answer the telephone and open and close whenever they please. I have gone to the office several times in the middle of the day during the week and they have been closed for whatever reason with NO notice. Not to mention the fact that they load your front door with useless letters several times per month. A friend of mine lives with his family within in the complex as well and they have had multiple requests to get things squared away in their apartment but at this point have lost hope and refuse to continue to ask. Needless to say that I feel like a total jerk for recommending this place. I would NOT recommend moving yourself or your family into this complex. It may look nice on the outside but ultimately it's trash, the Property Manager couldn't care less and I will be jumping for joy once my lease finally ends. I would love to move somewhere where my business is appreciated. And as of late, they no longer accept credit cards. Rent must be paid through cashier's check. (Another bit of information we found out through letters on the door) If you're looking to move into this complex, do yourself and the Property Manager a favor and don't even bother :( She'll be way too busy to meet your needs anyway."
0,"Can I give no stars?? Is that possible? Ok. This is very belated as I went here about a year ago. But I feel I have a service to uphold. I must give my opinion.  Ok...Saturday night.. I along with one male friend of mine and 4 female friends get prettied up and head out.  We figure, hey...why not check it out. So we go, and we get there about 11:30PM.  \n\nCouple problems: \n\n1) upon arrival, I should have known we were doomed because the hard rock as having a \""busy night\"" and would not valet your car unless you were a hotel guest. Lame right? I think so.\n\n2) We get to the club.  Not much of a line. About 30 people, mostly frat-boy looking dudes in front of us.  Remember my group is 2 guys/4 chicks. So I'm thinking...\""we'll get in fast\"".  Wrong assumption. We waited for AN HOUR!  Yes, one hour. ok. \n\n3) Cover was horrible, can't remember how much, but it sucked. Too much\n\n4) Get inside, need to get some drinks. Bar area crowded with sausage.  Drinks, just like everywhere...expensive. That's expected. \n\n5)  DJ...very bad.  Seriously...did you seriously play \""Sweet Home Alabama!?!?!?\"" And horrible transitions between songs. \n\n6)  Sausage fest.  I believe every white boy over 6' tall was called in from Nebraska for a convention.  It was ridiculous.  TOO MANY DUDES! I've never had some much male-@$$ rub up against me in one night.  It was seriously horrible.  \n\nAfter about an hour and a half..i had enough. We had to get the hell out of there. Too much cack, and the kittens that were there, were not even close to be attractive.  \n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS HELL HOLE!"
3,"If this were rated on prices, this would be a 2 star. \n\nI love the calamari. It costs like $11. Its way more than i'm willing to pay for that stuff, but do everytime. \n\nSo the story goes: they have hundreds of thousands of beers on tap....yadda yadda yadda..."
4,Great food. This is now my favorite place for breakfast. The carnitas omelette is so amazing. Highly recommend.
1,"And.....ACTION! \n(Couple enter cafe.....)\n\nThe place is so pretty. The waiter....more than incompetent. In the words of judge Milian, he \""doesn't have the common sense god gave a billy goat.\"" \n\nScrewed up my egg order and I repeated and confirmed it with him. The toast...okay, that wasn't toast, that was a fancy rock! For $12.99 per person, we shouldn't have expected much, I GUESS, but does name and reputation mean anything. While we've not even tried Denny during our stay, I'm almost positive that it was more tasty than my side of messed up egg order and rock bread. \n\nThe ambiance is the only good thing here."
3,"JPP is the place to go if you love pastries. You'll be literally like a kid in a candy store. The decadent desserts are really an art form, so pleasing to the eyes and senses.\n\nThey attract a lot of tourist with their Chocolate fountain which has been certified to be the largest in the world. It's a must see and you must take an obligatory picture with it to post on your Yelp, Urbanspoon, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or whatever social networking you currently are addicted.\n\nI had the raspberry and lime tarts, they were exquisite. I love the perfect balance of sweet and tangy in the lime tart. They also serve cakes, cookies, croissants, gelato, crepes, and other bakery goods. The only thing that disappointed me was the Americano as it was way watered down, similar to the old McDonald's coffee. Being an expensive high end Patisserie, I expected everything to be the best.\n\nThe layout needs to be redone. There is not enough space for more then one person to move about the store. You are constantly bumping into others who are taking pictures of goodies but may not be buying anything. \n\nSorry, one star deducted for expensive watered down Americano."
3,"Reasonably priced Strip hotel, decent casino.\n\nFriends and I stayed on (and subsequently laid waste to) the eighth floor. Our rooms were all recently renovated and much nicer than expected, thankfully nothing like the MGM. For what we paid, we got clean linens, soft beds, and good lighting. Of course, there was an iPod dock by the nightstand.\n\nThe Mirage's casino might be dark for some, but they've got a pleasantly vegetated bar area near the front lobby. If you're hungry, there's a light selection of restaurants. Table games have reasonable minimum limits, and not-so-reasonable limits are available for those who like the thrill of gambling. Played multiple deck Blackjack (didn't know that existed!) and roulette, and lost, but all of my friends won. Go figure!\n\nService was good. Called the front desk for various reasons, and friendly concierges got me details for a restaurant when I needed it.\n\nAnyone know of the tram between the Mirage and Treasure Island? It's so convenient! Not like it was an issue stumbling to a neighboring casino."
4,"My family has been going to Drr. Jackson for about 3 years now, and even though Iam not crazy about having to visit the dentist, I really like Dr. Jackson and his staff. If you are looking for a new dentist in the Scottsdale area, that is knowledgeable, courteous, and keeps you well informed as to what the plan is, this is your guy. His new hygienist  is also great,  I highly recommend this team!"
0,I had an aweful experience with this location while trying to order for 48 teachers for our school teacher appreciation.  It took me three phone calls to different managers to get an answer on the order to begin(I should have gone to a different restaurant then)after finally getting a response I ordered 48 burritos via a manager.  When my other PTA board member went to pay he confirmed that we had 5 burritos ordered.  Those were the 5 special ones and not the other 43.  They didn't know about a discount they had given us and the tax exempt.  She was told to bring it when I picked up and they would credit her card.  Well I was worried about my order so I showed up 15 minutes early the manager let me know I was early.  I informed her that I knew that.  I also was right in knowing they had my order wrong.  The manager from the night prior never passed my order to them so it was all wrong.  I waited and as I had 48 teachers waiting for dinner they finished late.  I asked if I could speak to a manager and no one would come speak to me.  They denied ever saying we could use our tax exempt form and would not credit us saying that no one ever told us that and told me they were sorry I felt the way I did.  Never and apology never is there anyway I can help NOTHING.  i totally understand human error but they treated me like dirt.  I would never recommend using them for any large party.  I had multiple burritos marked veggie and chicken and scratched out as teachers waited for their food during conferences.  Also when I asked for the area managers card they said they did not have his information!!!!
2,"Gili, the owner of the cart, wrote me and clarified a couple of issues. I love how Yelp provides a channel for concerns to be voiced to the owner, and together we hope we can make the experience better for others! \n\nI learnt from Gili himself that all of the food in the display case is in the refrigerator and is kept at the proper temperature, that makes me feel a lot at ease about the ingredients. It is also great that their open-concept cart lets customers see how their  food is prepared, since most typical food carts have small windows and you cannot watch the food preparation. So this is a great distinction from other food carts. That said it's almost impossible to stop flying insects completely. I am fine with that as long as they don't get onto the ingredients or onto the food. \n\nNow that I feel a lot more comfortable I am looking forward to going back to try their paninis again."
2,"Went for lunch, it was sort of empty, and we went for food and the sound of the music system was blaring and somewhat disrupted what we were there to do, visit.  And I didn't care for the choice of music much either.  Obviously they have good beers and decent table service.  I liked the chicken strips in the salad, it was a little bit better than I expected since this doesn't look like a place that would be known for its food.   Prices were reasonable, parking good, a few adjustments and it make make a good business lunch spot-- doesn't appear that the other customers were the swinging single types (for lunch), some had kids."
1,"I purchased the Groupon for the SinCity Comedy show the Comedian's were good we really enjoyed that portion of the show but the \""burlesque\"" portion was horrible it wasn't even real burlesque it looked more like cheap strippers with nicer lingerie on if I wanted to see strippers I would have gone to the strip club! The drinks weren't good at all and over priced! \n\nIn my advice pass on this show not worth the time!"
4,"I figure I'd add to this review too, my sister (michelle r. here on Yelp) already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic!  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials.  If not the special, yes, the katsudon is delicious (served w/ rice and onions and an egg on top!).  So are their bento boxes, I'll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes, their sushi is also really good.  My only complaint would be that it's a little small and it can get too crowded and busy, when that happens I'll go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the corner..."
1,"The three of us were exited to go here based on the other reviews. First the Ordering Process was awful - the Order was not entered correctly and two people Finished eating before the Third Plate arrived. Sodas are $ 2.00 per 12 OZ Bottle, the tea is one of those fruity teas sold at Big Lots because no one else would have it. While the place has excellent Bread far above average, everything else is average at best. The Pulled Pork is Overcooked - Under sauced and what is it with raw carrot sticks on the sandwich and Cilantro and Couscous on the side. The Corn Chowder that looks and tastes like canned Whole Corn with Half and Half added. Quiches - forget about it. The Pompous menu is in desperate need of a rework, the service needs Capable Trained employees (even a refill on the Tea is a chore), I can't think of any reason this place will make it. The do have a base of Great Breads - so so deserts, muffins and Danishes ( but nothing that makes them stand out). Management seems to lack Vision of what makes a place great."
1,"Let see: Slow service, subpar tasting food and a waiter hovering around our table pretty much sums it up. \nNever will go here again. \nOrdered the Belgian waffle (doughy and came with a pecan syrup that tasted like nothing and was watery. \nThe eggs were ok. Hard to mess that up.\nThe hash browns were solid\n\nWhat irked me was the waiter who was slowly cleaning up our table while our group was working out the bill, peeking over to see our tip. The service was slower than average, considering we had to wait over 30 min for our food. I might had well have gone back there and cooked my own da** waffle"
0,This location is actually why I switched back to Walgreens after so many years. The one a block away. I agree with the other reviews. Pharmacy is just plain rude. Horrible customer service.
2,"I hadn't been in a TRU in like, 10 years.  It was nice that it had many more 0-3 year old toys than Target did, and that it felt much cleaner than I was expecting.  They even have giant foam sharks ready for Shark Week! \n\nChecking out was a long process of rewards cards and upselling.  I like their selection, and their games section was in ruins (I think they were remodeling?)  but all in all, an okay experience."
0,"I brought my Isuzu Rodeo into this location of Brakes Plus during the first week of January 2010 because I received a coupon in the mail and had heard the radio commercials. \n\nEverything started off great. I was greeted by a nice guy named Kenny. I explained to him that I heard some squeaking and minor grinding when I slowed and asked him to check my brakes. I told him that I had just had one set replaced within the previous 6 months by Big-O but couldn't recall which set. \n\nI left the car and went to the movies with my wife. About 2 hours later Kenny called and told me that I needed to replace front and back brakes and that my shocks where shot and needed to be replaced. \n\nBy this time I had already run home (prior to the movie) and checked my Big-O receipt to see which set had been replaced. It was the front brakes, in June 2009. So when he told me both needed to be replaced I again told him they had just been replaced within the past 6 months. \n\nHe said the pads were completely cracked and that he was authorized by his manager to do a core trade-in which would save me $20-30 if I wanted to just avoiding having to deal with Big-O and have Brakes Plus replace the brakes. \n\nAt this point I had no reason to distrust Kenny so I was completely livid with Big-O. I chose not to replace the front brakes because I wanted to take the car back to Big-O, slam my keys on the counter and yell WTF!! I did choose to have the back brakes replaced but passed on the shocks because it wasnt in the budget.\n\nBrakes Plus finished with the car at nearly 5pm (I dropped it off at 10am) and I drove straight to Big-O. After a brief unpleasant exchange with the store manager they pulled my Rodeo into the shop immediately and with me standing right there pulled the wheels off and extracted the brake pads.\n\nNothing. The brake pads were in great shape. No cracks, no unusual wear. Nothing. I was so embarrassed I wanted to crawl under a rock and hide. \n\nAt that point I asked them to inspect my shocks. They were fine. Told me I probably had another 10-15K miles left on them. \n\nArgg! Did I really even need back brakes? I have no idea. Either way, this is a customers greatest fear when their car needs work, being taken advantage of by the mechanic. The behavior is unethical and unprofessional. I'm still trying to decide whether I should contact the Better Business Bureau or not.\n\nIf you need brakes, take your car any place else but Brakes Plus."

4,"Fate was on our side when we discovered and ate at this place by complete accident, and I'm so glad we did! It was quite an experience.\n\nWe accidentally got dropped off here by our taxi rather than at Raku, for dinner. Luckily, they are in the same strip mall so we trotted off to Raku, only to find we had about an hour wait. When on vacation, there are no rules, so we traced our path back to Sweets Raku and had dessert first!\n\nThis place is tiny (a few tables and the dessert bar where you can sit and watch them make your courses). It's all white and the servers are very sweet. For $19, you get a 3-course prix fixe dessert service like none other. \n\nThey start by bringing you a rolled up menu with a gold ring encircling it. After picking what you want, they pour a raspberry sauce on a plate and you dip you menu in it and eat it. Not only unique, it was actually quite good. You can even eat the gold ring.\n\nAfter the menu eating, you start with an Amuse. Ours was mango sorbet with mint jelly. I'll be honest, it looked and sounded not so good. But damn if it wasn't good! Super refreshing.\n\nThen you pick your main dessert from four selections. I chose the coconut panna cotta and my daughter had the pistachio & chocolate mousse. Both excellent and unique. They topped mine with some sort of wafer, poured sauce on top of that, and instead of overflowing, it melted or collapsed the wafer and the liquid into the serving dish. A show and a dessert in one.\n\nYou end with a petit four, equally odd and equally good. It's really hard to explain so I'll just suggest that you go there some time and try it. It's worth it and if you're a visitor like me, it's so refreshing to get off the Strip for just one evening.\n\nI also had an excellent cappucino with my dessert, complete with a crystalized sugar stick.\n\nDELISH! And from there, we wandered over and had dinner at Raku!"
1,"This restaurant has a cool atmosphere with nice outdoor seating. Glasses of wine were okay (which is too bad since all the glasses are $9+) but the \""pitchas\"" of beer are a pretty good deal. The food was alright, but the service left A LOT to be desired. Servers were slow and inattentive, and we had to consistently beg for water refills, which is a problem when you're sitting outside in 100+ degree weather. I recommend skipping dinner at this place and just heading next door for ice cream instead!"
3,"Came into Blue Ribbon Sushi with a group of 8 on a Saturday night. With no reservation I was pleasantly surprised how accommodating the staff was. They pulled together a table for us pretty quickly even tho the restaurant was pretty packed. Service was great and very attentive. They made some pretty good recommendations on menu items as well.\n\nHere are my thoughts on a few of the things we ordered:\n\nHummingbird Cocktail- Cava and too much St Germaine made this bubbly cocktail much too sweet\nPork Dumplings - good but nothing special \nShrimp Tempura - just like popcorn shrimp from Long John Silvers, not worth ordering\nMiso Soup- they brought out fresh miso to add to the broth which was super interesting and something I've never had before, who knew miso was its own thing? I thought that was just the kind of soup that it was.\nHotate Spicy Scallop Role- absolutely my favorite item and so happy I ordered this\nGreen tea martini- refreshingly delicious\nChicken Fried Rice- so delicious!! And very original in the way it was prepared and presented\nLive Scallop- weird and kind of boring actually\nVarious other rolls that were all pretty good too\n\nPricing on their menu items is pretty high so be prepared to drop a lot of dough when you go in here. Luckily we came in for a business dinner so I didn't have to worry about breaking my own bank. \n\nI definitely recommend this spot if you love sushi and want a great experience! Will definitely be back during my next Vegas trip!"
0,"I have lived in this area for 20 years and have never gone to this Filiberto's - my intuition told me no.\n\nI should have listened.  But noooo....\n\nI finally said - oh what the heck - it's right here and how bad could some carnitas and a bean burro be?  Safe...  right?  \n\nNo.\n\nFirst - it's 12:30 in he afternoon when I order and the cook is nowhere to be seen.  On a lunch break?  Probably.  I'm a patient guy and he or she deserves a break - NO biggie.  So I chill and wait for a few while watching a Mexican telenovela. \n\nAbout 5-8 minutes later he starts to emerge from the back room - not too long as a break goes - so I think oh great here he comes - until he emerges from the back room with a crappy attitude.  He's scowling at the half-dozen customers lining up for lunch and mumbling under his breath.  The young lady taking orders looks horrified and mumbles something at him in Spanish and he stops ranting for a bit.  Only to do it again a short time later.  \n\nYou ask - hey what's the saving grace here??  Well, I can fully see him cooking so I feel confident he's not spitting in the food.  That's a bonus! \n\nI could go on and on but I'll keep this short...\n\nMy takeout is done in just a scant few minutes and I haul it home.  The bean burro sucks.  The beans taste like they are 3 days old.  Dry as a bone and taste horrible.  \n\nThe Carnitas?  Same deal - they suck.  Dry and tasteless.  \n\nI'll stop back and try for a refund.  Yeah whatever.  I'm not holding my breath. \n\nAnd most importantly:  I'm not going back - ever - ever - ever - ever - again.  \n\nEven more importantly - never - ever - ever -ever - go to any restaurant without consulting YELP - this could have been avoided."
2,"usually get a pretty good wash...its not a detail so I can't be too picky.  but what bothers me is..there is limited seating inside and by one of the TVs there is a massage chair and 4 other semi comfortable leather chairs.  the place is full inside (its 112\u00b0 outside) and no place to sit, in the section I mentioned by the TV sits 4 employees with their wash rags, spray bottles etc... leaves me with one seat right in the middle as they talk across me and shoes keep touching my shoe due to our legs crossed. if they're slow I don't think its a huge deal but if the place is full and customers are standing.....that shouldn't be an employee break area..sorry! very uncomfortable this visit."
3,"What a nice place, great staff my waitress Lindsey was very nice.  Always a treat to get a perfectly cooked sunny side egg, and the hash wasn't too bad either."
1,"They have gorgeoussettings both outside and inside. But that's about it. The food is mediocre and overpriced. I ordered Tom Yum soup and Eggplant dish. Tom Yum soup was not that flavorful and portion is too small to be charged $7 with Tofu.  The eggplant dish was pretty tasty, but they did one of my pet-peeves; charging a cup of rice separately!  I guess if you are not Asian, then this place can be a hot place to go, but I think Asian people like myself can find somewhere else."
3,"I'm glad the intoxicating sweet aroma of crepes doesn't make it out beyond the front door or else this quaint little place would be packed, with nowhere to sit. Luckily, it was a Tuesday morning so we shared our brunchtime with just a handful of other lucky patrons. Great cozy atmosphere, tasty yummies and lovely, gratious service."
1,"I have been here twice while working in Vistancia.  It's a typical \""order at the counter and then they bring out the food too you\"" AZ eatery.  \n\nOn the first visit we ordered the Grande pizza (their supreme) and it was quite tasty.  The service was mediocre but my company was quite entertaining.\n\nThe second time I opted to eat here I decided on the sausage sub and my coworker had the roast beef sub.  I was less impressed the second time around as they skimped on the meat.  My sub was mainly bread; soggy bread from all the sauce and my co workers sub only had 1 thin layer of roast beef but was loaded down with lettuce and cheese.  Now I know we are in a depression but please don't get so cheap with your portions.  We spent $5.50/person for this \""lunch special\"".\n\nMy advice:  If you come here don't get a sub.  Just go for the pizza."
4,"This was the first sushi restaurant I have visited in years, and the very first one I've visited in Arizona.  The friend I went with said it was the best sushi restaurant in the east valley (some poll or other said so), thus we decided to take a stab at it.  And, to be honest, I mainly wanted to taste miso soup again (one of my favorite soups on the planet).\n\nWe walked in and it looked like any typical asian restaurant.  To one side was a long bar, where you can sit and eat, or sit and drink saki or beer.  To the other side was a long row of booths.  We decided to booth it up.  We sat down and shrugged... seemed fine so far.  The decor looked a little cheap, but the more hole-in-the-wall a place is, the more likely I will like it.\n\nSo, we both order a Japanese beer, take out the sushi list, and just go to town.  We order just about one of everything, including bowls of miso soup.  I was surprised that the sushi came out one at a time.  We'd dig into one, and once we were almost done and forming our opinions about it, another one would come out.  That was kinda fun.  Every kind we decided to get was exquisite, and reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in Minneapolis, Kikugawa (and believe you me - I've tried EVERY sushi restaurant in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area).\n\nNot only was the sushi tasty but it was *beautiful*.  They must have really talented sushi chefs working for them, because it was wonderful.  This was also the first time I got \""deep fried\"" sushi.  If you haven't tried it... DO IT!  We got a deep fried roll that had crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, and rice... wow.  Mind blown (can you tell I really love certain things??).\n\nIf I can find other friends who would like to go out to a sushi restaurant in the east valley, this restaurant will definitely be revisited by me!  (Plus, surprise, they gave us free dessert!  Yay watermelon!)"
3,"Cool cinema. Very new and clean. All the films are in French. We saw Eat, Pray, Love aka Mange, Prie, Aime here. It was all good. I would definitely return here the next time I am in Montreal."
2,"little disappointed with the waiters recommendation of the sea bass.. quite citrusy and unimaginative overall  with just those sliced cherry tomatoes, red and yellow.. the fish was not fresh.. I have to say the the large meatball appetizer was really nice.."
3,Wow Vegas! Haven't been to this airport in 2 years and the upgrades you've made are fantastic. \n\nMuch bigger airport. More food options. Clean!!! And no smoky smell. Thank you for Terminal 3!!!
1,"Great burger chain, I just hate this one particular restaurant that's on the strip.\n\nDirty on the outside and horribly crowded on the inside. You'll see all sorts of people in the inside from the business professional to the dirty street hookers. What's important is that they're actually pretty well behaved since they've all walked off the alcohol I guess. This place is crowded as hell and it will take you a while to get your food.\n\nI ordered the king burger and a peanut butter shake and ate it all. The food was great but the waitline was just way way too long. We should have just gone through the drive through and then sat inside or something. (This technique works well at crowded In-N-Outs.)"
4,"I needed to transfer family heirloom shotguns from AZ to our son in Missouri.  The people at Guns Plus couldn't have been more accomodating.  Ken and Kat were the two wonderful people who assisted me and they made the process quick and easy. They completely took away the hassle and run-around that I was experiencing from previous people I was trying to deal with. Customer Service?  As they were assisting me, they would continually greet people coming into the store saying with \""sir, we'll be right with you.  Please feel free to look around.\""  Their Customer Service is excellent.  I don't know which store the other people who reviewed Guns Plus visited, but it couldn't have been this one.  Thank you Kat and Ken for a great experience."
1,"*Daily Dose Midtown*\n\nMe and a friend had finished our meals and had stayed around to continue in conversation.  We were sitting outside and the weather is nice today so we stayed a while longer. After refilling our water 2 times our waiter (Jesse) comes back as ask us if we could leave (is in he was kicking us out) because it was picking up and the restaurant had started to form a line.... Without fuss I complied and stood up and as I was leaving a nearby couple had asked me if he (the waiter) just asked us to leave... I told them yes. \n\nI do not know if that was proper protocol but I must say ... I feel extremely embarrassed, appalled and disrespected. I enjoy the Daily Dose for its food and atmosphere and have come here on multiple occasions and truly loved everything about it. I'm able to separate this experience from those but this none the less is not becoming of a establishment I enjoyed."
2,"Blue Martini is an okay option when you don't want to be on the Strip and want a wide selection of drinks. The food is halfway decent, prices pretty much in line with the Strip, and there is music and occasionally dancing (music varies between bands and DJs, depending on the night/time). I've had some good drinks, and I've had ones that were pretty gross, but overall I've been satisfied enough. \n\nA lot of the surrounding bars/restaurants, such as Nu Sanctuary and Cadillac Ranch have closed down, so Blue Martini has become one of the few options at Town Square these days. As a result, it can get really crowded, and all seating is on a first come, first serve basis.\n\nHappy Hour is a good option (all drinks 50% off), and the bartenders and waitresses are all good eye candy, so there's that, too."
0,"Not impressed as you can see by the one star. I have been to Native Newyorker many times, different locations and I have never been thoroughly impressed. With the new sign and switch up of their name I thought what the heck let's try this place again. So I patiently waited for the surprise location to open, I'm driving by one night and I see it's open so I swoop in. Turns out that it was the soft opening, family and friends night, a score for me because it was 50% off everything! Sat down decided I was going to try their blue cheese chicken nachos thingy appetizer (I can't remember the name) it came out and I took a few bites and felt like well this isn't that great, but at least they aren't horrible...and let's not forget it's 50% off!!! So I decided for my main meal I was going to get the pretzel bun sliders, and my husband wings... And this is where the one star comes in, the food was horrible. How could a place with wings in their name mess up the wings?!?? They did and I won't be back. Glad it was 50% off!"
3,"Sweet fancy Moses this place is delicious!  Very authentic middle-eastern fare with nice friendly service.  I had the Combination Combination, gyros, dolmas, tabouli, falafel, etc....all the good stuff you would expect when ordering this kind of food.  It was all fantastic and for all this food it was only $11.99!  \n\nHighly recommended spot in a strip mall, where apparently all good restaurants in Phoenix are located..."
1,"Well, Groupon brought me to this place and after checking the place on Yelp I did not expect much first of all but ohhhh my...\nOk, so the room in general is not that bad for the money. You get your standard beds, TV, mini fridge ( no content; no this is not a mini bar) and can't complain. The bath room is plain to say the least but oh well you save money.\nBUT, the negatives are plenty. First of all, the check in was ridiculous. There were sixty people ahead of me and the service was very slow. Second, a huge cock roach popped up in the bathroom while I was washing my face and I mean HUGE. \nThird, the casino area is shameful, lol, I give it back, it's hilarious. It's so so bad and only fills up at two a.m. with some rough looking morning to evening drinkers. The bartender was really rude when I showed him my drink coupon. Also, the drinks were horrible.\nNow the worst part: the elevator to the parking structure. OMG, I got stuck in it and had to press the emergency button. Never happened to me before. Awkwardly, someone had opened the emergency box door before!!!\nOverall, yes this place is ghetto. really. But if you are trying to save money and to spend it on the strip, close your eyes, walk past the hallway and the casino and enjoy a mediocre room and a beautiful Las Vegas."
1,"Sadly, I had to change my review of All About Smiles. I mentioned in my previous review that they have very limited hours. And they are kind of far for me as well. \n\nSo I found a dentist closer to me that has early morning hours. Not because of the quality of care I had at All About Smiles. I really liked Dr. Phan. It was just impossible for me to get their with my work schedule.\n\nAt my initial exam with my new dentist, he asked if I got X-rays at All About Smiles. I did, so he had his receptionist call them to see if they can email or fax them over to save me some money. They said they could only mail them. \n\nA week later they still didn't receive the X-rays in the mail. They tried another time and still didn't get them. I am tempted to drive over there myself and get them, but instead I am just going to shell out some more dough to get them done at my new dentist's office. \n\nI was going to give one star for this awful customer service but I really like Dr. Phan. She needs to get some better office help. I should have known by how the receptionist was singing along very loudly to the radio in the waiting room that this office lacked professionalism."
2,"i felt very blah about my food.  i feel bad because i wasn't in the best of mood for brunch food, but am trying to rate without that in mind.\n\nnow, mind my snobiness, but we have some damn good brunch in chicago, and unfortunately this place just couldn't live up to my windy city standards.  the pancakes were good but a bit flat for my taste - as in, not poofy.  i know this is the new pancake fashion, flat cakes with compote of some sort, but it wasn't wow-ing.  the potatoes were okay, extremely greasy and IMO not seasoned well, instead depending on its spicy greasy sauce instead.  whatever.  anyway, the boyfriend seemed to enjoy my pancakes much more than i did, but wasn't thrilled with his special scrambler.  unfortunately it was made with lots of green onion and the potatoes have them, as well, so it was a little too much green onion overall.  the jam sitting out on the table was delicious and coffee was good, too.\n\noverall good, but not wowing."
1,Flew out of Terminal 2 this morning and didn't have a great experience.\n\nCheck in agents at United desks were overworked. Precheck wasn't open yet so I had to stand with the commoners. TSA agent had a chip on his shoulder. And there was nothing inside the terminal.\n\nI hear they're tearing this terminal down soon. Good.
1,"The bar & staff are beautiful I will admit. But the drinks & desserts from next door were very disappointing. I had a strawberry & Lychee caipiroska which tasted like Hawaiian punch & cough medicine. I asked the server if I could change the drink because it tasted terribly, they refused. Whatever happened to good customer service? I'm not asking to change a sandwich to a steak & lobster. They need to change their attitude & where they get their desserts. Woof!"
2,"Had the Fish and Chips as well as the Chicken Pot Pie.  Portions were large and ambience fun, yet the price for the fish and chips seemed a bit high for their mediocre quality.  Just good, nothing special.  The Chicken Pot Pie however was wonderful and very worth the 21$ price tag.  Covered with a rich and flakey puff pastry, this steamy stew could be the favorite of any regular here."
1,"I started going here a year ago.  Dr. Skinner is the only reason I go back.  He is gentle, caring and attentive.  I don't have much to say about the office staff.  It feels like they're only nice to you if you get work done. The hygienist was really nice but I felt pressured to do the fluoride rinse that was an extra fee!  If a good dentist is important to you and you can overlook everything else, then go see Dr. Skinner."
4,Black Dog all you need to know is it is scary good. Line may be out the door but it is worth the wait. This is grown man Barbeque!
4,"This place is a great place for lunch and to have business meetings. If you can, sit outside. The view of the Golf Course is beautiful. Steve Wynn knows how to do everything right. The food and service is excellent, classy place. Here was our order:\n\nApps: Organic Golden Beet \""Carpaccio\"", Australian Wagyu Beef Carpaccio- Both were delicious and the Beets were very refreshing.\n\nEntree: Tossed Cobb Salad, Prime Sirloin Steakhouse Salad- Both salads were great. They were crisp and had the freshest ingredients. The steak was seasoned to perfection.\n\nIt was a very healthy, light but filling lunch. Would love to go back and try the dinner options."
2,"like plato's closet, i've only sold here so my review is on the selling experience alone. basically you bring your clothes in, and they sort through them deciding which ones they will sell for you. every time i've gone to this location, they've quoted a 5 to 10 minute wait and finished within the quoted range. \n\ni like that they are quick. i like that they usually take most of my stuff. i like that they will donate the rejects for me.\n\nwhat i don't like is that they are not very friendly or welcoming or appreciative of me bringing in my clothes for them to make money off of. i also don't like the whole idea of consignment because i never really know what sold and what they got for it and what they gave me. \n\nyou just go back a few weeks later and check your account to see if you've earned any money. there's a lot of trust involved. ebay is definitely the way to go if you really want to get the most for your clothes, but if you don't have time this is an ok alternative."
0,I was so excited to come here after reading all the reviews. Gosh was I disappointed!! I ordered combo #1 and only the rice and taco was edible - the enchiladas were terrible. I also ordered guacamole which was disgusting and I could tell it was old. Don't come here! Azteca beats this place all to heck. Sure wish I could find a good Mexican restaraunt here!!
4,"great selections. Sushi, mongolian bbq, Dim Sum, and even fried checken. It tastes homemade and delicious."
3,"have a vacation home in queen creek so i dnt  know how to go anywhere else other then to the shopping center where walmart is at this is where i came across the jungle buffet so i figuer i would give it a try i was so suprised how economical this place is and everyone was nice n friendly, the place is cheap n has good food i almost felt as if i should pay more. its one of the places i visit everytime im in town"
0,"P\u00e9simo ambiente,  exceso de ruido y los meseros se tardan un mont\u00f3n en llevar los cubiertos,  no me gust\u00f3 y no se lo recomiendo a nadie,  como dice afuera que es un lugar familiar con tanto ruido."
1,"Forget about reservation, still waiting after 40 mins past my reserved time. Very rude hostess kept lying about our table will be ready soon, manager was nice enough to offer free drinks for waiting. \nThen after almost 1 hour of waiting we were finally seated, but now more waiting for our waiter to help us and after that 1 hour of waiting for food.  My friend ordered medium and the steak came out well done, again the manager offers free dessert for their mistake.  Our reservation was 7:30 and we were there until almost 11, the whole time I felt like one of my ex girlfriend (always bitching).  Horrible experience even with the free drinks and dessert."
3,"I came here one weekend with a group of friends to have a nice dinner, and I was impressed.\n\nWe had two waitresses, which was kind of odd to me, but they were very attentive. They explained how all of the steaks could be prepared, the specials for the day, and answered any questions that we had.\n\nI had the lobster bisque to start, and it was very smooth and creamy--very good. I thought the color was strange, though. It was bright orange, kind of like nacho cheese, but it tasted just fine.\n\nFor my entree, I had the 7oz filet that was cooked in garlic, peppercorns, and roasted shallot cabernet butter. I think it was called the \""Hines Ward,\"" but I can't be positive, and Oo the side I chose green beans. Everything was REALLY good, and I was full without being stuffed.\n\nFor dessert, my friend and I decided to split the carrot cake. For anyone who decides to order the carrot cake or the chocolate cake--BE PREPARED. You will get a full quarter of a good-sized round cake. IT IS HUGE. One \""serving\"" is enough for four people, I'm not kidding. Three of us had a good helping at the restaurant, and took the rest home, where it gave us three more helpings. The cake is only $10, also, so it's definitely the most bang for your buck."
1,"I would describe this place as a strange fusion of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food. What's even stranger is that this restaurant is located in Imperial Palace. I never thought that I'd see an Asian restaurant with hot stone bibimbap anywhere on The Strip, actually. So, I give this place points for even existing.\n\nThe food was, at its best, just alright. Mark S. and I came here after a visit to Oshea's bar. We had a late-night Asian food craving, and since this place is open 24 hours, we figured we might as well give it a shot. When am I going to learn that Vegas is not the place to find good Asian food?\n\nI ordered their hot stone bibimbap with kalbi beef, which was $17 -- Yes, I paid around $17 for the worst bibimbap I've ever had. Seriously, it came out kinda tacky, with a weird \""chip\"" on the top, and I have no idea what it was to this day. All I know was that the \""chip\"" was super salty, and there was only one of it in the bowl. Not to mention that the banchan was non-existent. In fact, we only had a side dish of kimchi and that was about it. The bibimbap itself was way too greasy, and the kalbi tasted like ground up hamburger, which it probably was. Anyways, it was easily the most flavorless bibimbap I've ever had -- you'd think I'd at least enjoy it in my drunken state.\n\nIf you're particular about your Asian food, don't come here. To be fair though, I only had the Korean food. I didn't try the other stuff.\n\nEither way, with its ridiculous prices and mediocre service, I will not be back. I know that Vegas is expensive, but $17 for one bowl of bibimbap that had no flavor and no banchan is just way too much to ask for."
0,"My husband and I went to VH Spa for our anniversary.  We used a TravelZoo voucher and had massages and facials book.  At the time of booking, they told us that we could substitute other services if we didn't want the facial.  Upon check-in, we were only given one other alternative, foot reflexology, and only one of us could do it!  So my husband decided to do the facial, since I don't trust anybody touching my face.  We both thought the massages were just okay.  I really don't think the massage therapists are trained very well there.  Mine for example would rub the top of my feet more than the bottom, not very relaxing.  She also spent a lot of time in weird areas when I told her that I my shoulders are the problem area.  She also seemed to have an attitude.  My husband and I get massages often and we are usually pretty happy, but the techniques at least my therapist used were terrible.  In fact, she hardly even tried to work on my knots, despite being a \""deep-tissue\"" massage.  It was supposed to be a 1-hour massage, but instead she only worked on me for 45 minutes.  Then we started the foot reflexology, which was very strange.  I asked her if we could cut it short and work on some of the knots in my neck.  She didn't seem to pleased about that but agreed and proceeded to very strongly rotate my neck, as if trying to prove a point or something.  Overall, it was not a great experience.  The spa facilities are also lacking.  Not the serene, relaxing experience we were hoping for.  I would recommend checking out the Montelucia or Sanctuary spa for a real treat.  Will definitely not be going back to VH Spa.\n\nUPDATE:  I have reviewed the Manager's response and have some comments.  First, I was not aware that getting a massage in the same room as my husband would be considered an \""upgrade.\""  If this is something that you would normally have to pay extra for then I would definitely NOT recommend doing so.  Second, I have received numerous prenatal massages, all of which have been much better than the service I received at VH Spa.  If their policy is to not treat pregnant women to certain services, then I'm still not sure why they allowed me to change my facial to foot reflexology when we arrived?!  There was never any mention that I would not receive normal service because of pregnancy.  If the policy is not to allow deep tissue or foot reflexology, this is the first I'm hearing of it.  My husband also felt his massage was weak and lacking skill, so I'm surely not the only one.  My massage was terrible, there really is no excuse for it.  I seriously wanted to leave halfway through.  Massage is highly recommend to relax and soothe pregnant women and this one fell very short of the mark.  Third, the voucher I purchased was for a 1-hour massage, as such that is what I expected.  Instead I was given a 45-minute service.  Overall, the service was lacking in more ways than one and the fact that a manager would use pregnancy as an excuse for the lack of service/attitude I received makes my desire never to go back even stronger. Would much rather find a place that pampers pregnant women rather than using pregnancy as an excuse for poor service.  Lowering my star rating to 1 based on all the above."
1,"I usually avoid this ross, especially on weekends... but a situation came up and we ended up at ross... Not a very good selection, usually poorly organized and under stocked on women's clothes & shoes.\n\nNICE EMPLOYEES THOUGH!"
4,Excellent Chinese food. Make sure to order the Wing Lei martini delicious I had 4 of them Wow I need to get the recipe. I'm glad we came here for dinner.
2,"As far as the services go , amazing . But the wait is over an hour long and I called the office four times today regarding my appointment and I got no answer . Terrible customer service"
3,"Great place, but I'm knocking off a star, because they made my friend and I move off the couch when more people came in.  I don't like to be moved around when I am trying to relax after a long day.  I don't even care if they sat next to me, but if I am lucky enough to grab a couch when I go to one of these places, I don't want to have to get off of it."
0,"Okay, before I have my ass yelled out, let me explain!\n\nI admire the beauty and athleticism of these \""artsy-fartsy\"" shows. I do! But they just don't tickle my pickle.\n\nLe R\u00eave is based on a dream... Cool concept, but it's a long, drawn out, wet dream... and not the fun kind.\n\nThe theater is small and circular. There is not a bad seat in the house. Kudos to the theater on that note.\n\nHowever, I can only see so many ariel spins, twirls, dives, and blah, blah, blah. It was boring and repeative. After 10 minutes, I was constantly checking the clock on my phone.\n\nThe music isn't engaging, the emotions aren't there. There were a few comediac moments brought on by the gentlemen in the white tuxes, but other than that it was a BIG SNOOZE FEST. There was a part of the show where a big, white doll/marinette thing came down... WTF was that? The show is odd and weird."
0,"So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review.  Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'\n\nSo I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \""Blue experience,\"" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  \nSo the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right?  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  \n\nSo, food, how was the the food?  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \""Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\""  sounds fancy, eh?  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.\n\nSo let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity?  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:\nManager: \""hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything?\""\nMe: \""Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\""\nManager: (blank stare)\nMe:  (awkward moment)\nManager; \""well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\"" (blank stare).\nMe: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).\nManager: (blank stare and walks away).\n\nneedless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
2,I like the place... Very quiet. The staff is attentive. Other patrons are pleasant. Great menu... Something to please even the pickiest of eaters.\n\nTotally not a fan of the ceviche. They do not cook the fish in lime juice...so I was told by a staff member. The shrimp delivered on a bed of rice was delicious tho!
4,I had Damian do my massage and he's great!! Totally destressed me from wedding planning! Very professional and highly recommended!
3,"Needed something quick and not too heavy so I could focus on finishing a project for school, so my husband called ahead and it was ready and waiting when I arrived.  Easy parking since they have several 15 minutes pick-up spots designated for Crazy Pita.  Yeah!\n\nWe had a veggie skewer with red pepper, red onion, egg plant, and tomato, and we also ordered a shrimp skewer and falafel with hummus (they were served with roasted peppers which made my husband so very, very happy).  The skewer came with hummus, feta salad, and veggie couscous.  There were beautiful chunks of butternut squash with the couscous and they ended up being my favorite!\n\nI love that they don't over salt their food.  It was grilled beautifully, the hummus was creamy, and the feta salad was crisp and cold.  Nicely done!"
2,"I first entered the restaurant and I was very surprise to see it busy on a Wednesday night. I enjoyed the atmosphere. We sat down and immediately after received menus. The food was fantastic. I really was expecting very service. our waiter was friendly, polite, but did not pay much attention to details and to the table. Our food came and He came back to check on us when we were almost finished. \nI would go back to try it again."
1,"I really wanted to like this place but I guess that's not going to happen. The food wasn't that great but the service was good. \nThe chicken was very dry and the fries were nothing special. And their special sauce is nothing special, it's just mayo, ketchup, and pepper. At least that's what it tasted like to me. \nThey don't have much of a selection. I think there only 3 different types of meals you can choose from. I wish they had some meals that have dark meat. \nThe Texas toast was the only thing that was enjoyable. It was fluffy and lightly toasted.\n\nWe went through the drive through and it took a very long time to get the food and then we almost didn't get our drinks. And then we get drinks and they aren't the right ones. \n\nAll the employees were very friendly. They get 5 stars!"
2,"Watch out for the junior high and early high school kids at this location.... it's right by the movie theater, which means they all hang out here before and after the movie. The coffee isn't especially bad...but it's not especially good either. Fine if you're in the area. If not, it's not worth a special stop."
2,The place and ambiance was great.....but...from a tapanyaki standpoint....about as close to the bottom as possible. Benihana's was one of the originals.....it sure hasn't kept up with the rest of them!
4,Best pierogis in the city! And being in Pittsburgh that says a lot. Haluski is pretty awesome to with the bacon!
0,"I would like to rate the food, but it never got here. The delivery driver came to our work, sat in his car for 5 minutes and then came to door and knocked. The door was answered immediately and the driver said that he had been waiting at the door for about a half an hour. (Surveilence cameras confirm the park and wait 5 minutes.) We told him to just hold on for a second while we grabbed the person who placed the order (there are about 50 people in the building at this time) and he told us to not to call there again while he is literally shoving his foot in the door. Since we are in a secure building, all deliveries need to stay outside of the door. Literally about 30 seconds later the person who ordered came to the door and the driver was already getting back in his car. Since this order was placed through Eat 24, the person who ordered called them back and was promptly told the restaurant was refusing to give any money back because we made him wait unreasonably long. Eat 24 was kind enough to oblige my employee her money back in the form of credit to her account. Unfortunately, my employee was now on her lunch break with no lunch and heaping helping of crappy service from a cranky curmudgeon. I called te restaurant to see if I could reason with their manager and provide proof of the driver lying about the wait time (which could also be proven with Eat 24 call records) and also to see if we could get past this as my employees order daily from this estabishment. I was given the run around by the staff and eventually hung up on. I called back and they told me that they would have the manager call me back. It has been 3 weeks and I have not received a call back. I am glad that some people have a great experience with Palermo's Pizza, but as for my employees...not one of them will ever patronize or reccomend this restaurant to anybody. Customer service is as important to a restaurant as it's product, if their customer service is a reflection of their product they must be making a killing in the sale of feces."
0,If you  want the slowest service when 2 people Are making drinks  then for Shure come here.... This is why old people shouldn't work at Starbucks
2,"Now I am extremely picky as far as pizza goes and was definitely not feeling fantastic when we had arrived for my boyfriends fantasy football draft.  So I wanted to see if eating food would help and would take away my weird stomach pains.  The guys ordered the pizza kind of late so I was dying by the time the pizza came out. Even though I ordered the ginger pomegranate sparkler which unfortunately did not help as much as I would have liked.  The pizzas were so much better than I expected because the last time that we came my burger was so bland.  I absolutely hated it.  But the other day changed my mind, those pizzas were awesome. Not my absolute favorite or anything but i look forward to the next visit so that way I can try different toppings.  I heard the pizookie was just okay and okay doesn't tempt me ever to try it, I will be sticking to the pizzas and sparklers from now on ;)"
1,"I visited this place with my Mom, didn't realize it opened at 5pm. Waited a while, they opened the place and sat us around 505.\nI purchased the Seafood Shack Clam Bake and was excited-the place looked neat and the servers were friendly. \nIt's Vegas so I didn't mind paying $80 for my Mom and I to get the most expensive thing on the menu, and I don't think I've had Maine Lobster before!\nSince we were the first ones there we got served pretty quickly. The food looked nicely presented. When I dug in I realized the muscles were teeny-I mean, I've never seen such small muscles. The shrimp was so overcooked they were dark red and rubbery, the lobster was laughably small and overcooked as well. \nI was upset at being ripped off, we could have had a feast at Bacchanal for the same price but the people were nice and the service was quick.\nWOULD NOT RECOMMEND, there's so much better on the strip."
4,"Yes, I am a fan of Roy's. You can never go wrong with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two - Grilled Szechuan Pork Ribs, Kalua Pork Dim Sum, Seared Tiger Shrimp Sticks, Lobster Potstickers & Crispy Spicy Tuna - all of which are simply fabulous. For my entree on this visit I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - and the Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce was absolutely amazing.\n\nOn top of the food, however, the service was amazing. There was a hockey fan at our table who was interested in the final Kings game (where, yes, they beat the Devils) and since there was zero cell reception where we were sitting a trip to the bar to see the TVs was the only fix available. Of course the game end was coming as the main course was being delivered and who I assume was the manager asked us almost immediately if we needed it placed under the heat lamps for a bit. To extend this good gesture it was brought back at the same moment the game was over and they were ready to enjoy the meal -- without even asking for it.\n\nThen, if you have never been to a resort before in the Phoenix area get ready to leave the desert for a brief moment while you take in the surroundings of the Marriott location."
2,"I've been here several times but only tried the food once. I'm no expert, but when I was in Germany I remember liking the food and here it was just kind of blah. I'm not a polka fan either so I didn't like the band that played during dinner. However, I really liked the band that played later in the evening on the weekends. I don't know if they still play since I haven't been here in a year.  They used to play motown and oldies and it was fun to dance to, and was a nice change compared to the music other bars/clubs play. After you go a few times you'll realize that they sing the same songs week after week so it got old really fast. It was fun at the time though!"
0,Don't DO IT! They ARE HORRIBLE!! Stay Away!! LOOKS are deceiving...
4,"The Red Velvette Waffle is on the \""Secret Menu\"" so you have to ask for it. It is definitely worth is. Really rich but oh so delicious."
0,"A disappointment in service and quality. Wish we had tried Sugar Factory or returned to Vosges Haut-Chocolat. \n\nWaited in line to order at the walk-up window, as others have done. When it was time to place our order, the attendant was not paying attention. We had to repeat our order multiple times (a small Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate) since he was having more fun conversing with a co-worker. Next, we moved forward to the pick-up window where there were some annoyed looking people. \n\nWe waited. We watched those in the kitchen --- some working, others standing around. We waited. Those around us waited. Every once in awhile an order came up -- typically orders for a few scoops of ice cream. More time passed. Orders placed after ours were called. Other orders before ours still were not ready. Person at the window started to make a frozen drink at one point, then stopped. Tickets were rearranged -- one thrown away. Time kept ticking. \n\nFinally, we asked about our order and when it would be ready. Guy at the window looked at his tickets and did not have ours. Perhaps ours had been the order that we had seen him throw away earlier? Or, maybe the person who took our order never put it in the right spot? Either way, he was rude about it and wanted our ticket, which we gave to him. Next, he went back to the frozen drink that he started to make earlier and gave it to us. If we hadn't been there watching, I think he would have spit in it based on his attitude. \n\nDrink was too sweet to be enjoyable."
2,"I stayed at the tropicana (my first time staying here) from april 13-14 ...my boyfriend and i previously booked this hotel through expedia (we chose the mystery 4-star hotel and got trop.) I havent stayed here before but I walked into the hotel years before the renovation and I can def. tell the difference. The decor has stepped up and looks much, much cleaner with the south beach theme going on. you can def smell the coconut suncreen scent throughout the hotel.\n\nI had previously booked for their basic hotel room but I had contacted Nicole Marshall who was def. helpful with helping us upgrade to the paradise suite! I saw how much it was going for that weekend I was going and im thankful that she gave us a great deal!\n\nthe hotel parking itself was a bit confusing for me because i came down straight from Las Vegas Blvd; and I couldn't understand their self parking signs because one said it was on the right but it was a really small lot. I parked there because all the other signs said valet parking. my boyfriend and I were like we'll ask the front desk to make sure because usually the hotels ive stayed at in vegas have a parking structure to park in. (I parked outside in a small lot with numbers on space where you parked.) so my bf and i walked from that parking lot, passed the old 50's style car and went towards the lobby...\n\nfront desk def. needs help in my opinion, the lines/signs to check in was confusing because well... neither sign said it was for checking in!! another woman and i were confused at the same time...so we went into the check out line because the other one was for showtimes. when it was my turn to check in, i was def. happy/excited/polite but the front desk employee had no facial expression, no enthuasiam, just said \""hi\"" ONLY BECAUSE i said . \""hello how are you today?\""...yeahh i didnt get any enthuaism out of her nor a how are you back from her (she was a younger african american employee-i didnt catch her name badge/name), she took my id and went through the paperwork, she gave the map to me and said my room was on the 15 floor, in the club tower and to head straight to the escaltors...and i asked \""okay thank you, i was wondering do you have more self parking and where is it?\""\nshe just replied, \""yes we do.\"" i was waiting for more of a explanation where and how i can get there...she just pointed to the map. at that point , i just said okay thanks and wasnt even going to be bother her anymore because i got that impression that i was \""bothering\"" her. i thought i would hear more like thanks for staying at the tropicana and oh here's our deals ...etc. just nothing. usually i get a cheerful welcome and thank you..plus coupons and such when i stay but like i said i didnt want to bother her. the only thing i can say great about the front desk/lobby is that their lights are def amazing looking...reminds me of planet hollywood lobby/front desk.\n\nthe room was def not what my boyfriend and i expected...it was a great looking, spacious room esp since i did not expect it from tropicana. we got the paradise suite and it was amazingly big, it had a cool wetbar/counter WITH a mini fridge cooler! spacious living room, bedrooom (the bed was SO comfortable!!), his and her sinks + our own countertops...i was expecting to find the free umbrellas i saw that they give out to their guests in their room but i only found the sleeping masks. the only gripe about my room was that we had put a \""do not disturb\"" sign on our door the whole stay and usually they dont clean your room when they do. usually i do not like them to because im usually set with the amt of towels they give and im not picky about everything being cleaned everyday of my stay. but they cleaned our room (weird)...they touched some of our belongings and awkwardly folded my boyfriend's clothes and stuck them on top of the drawer...i dont know...they did a good job on cleaning but i dont like the fact that our belongings were moved and touched. i wished tropicana wouldnt put the thick blinds on their windows because you can barely see a view of the strip...but other than that it was a great room.\n\noverall, its a great value room if you didnt want to stay at excalibur or off the strip but i wouldnt stay here again. just because i know with the amount of money ive spent on this room was the same amt i paid for the cosmopolitan but i got to stay one more night longer at cosmo and i had a terrance to stare out at the view of the strip. plus tropicana didnt have a large casino area to walk around & gamble in, they dont have a great selection of places to eat (my bf and i had to go the mgm's food court most of the time to eat), and nothing wow'ed me at all. it was almost basically nothing to do  here and their red card that we signed up for...we didnt use- its a trick if you actually read the ways of how to play their \""free $200 slot play\""---word of advice...do NOT use it!  but great thanks to Nicole for our stay and helping me fix the kinks of my hotel bil"
4,Very good. We had the topless burgers with spinach dip beet salad and steamed vegetables.  Ill definately be back
1,"While the room was clean and well-appointed, the hospitality was lacking. Long check-in wait, Bamboo pool was closed, the other non-topless pool was crawling with swinger-types and all the lounge chairs were either occupied or reserved. I asked a guy setting out more loungers how I could get one and he told me they were first come, first served, even though I could see about 20 in the storage locker behind him. The front desk didn't know which ballroom my conference was in, shopping was meh.\n\nFelt like I fit the Cosmo's target demographic, but they're not trying hard enough to fit my target vacay destination. Would be hard-pressed to stay here again."
1,"Before departing from Charlotte, I went with two of my friends to Vivace on a Sunday evening. The environment had been calling to me for a few months so I figured maybe last time was just a bad night and all of these 5-star reviews must be there for a reason...\n\nBut, alas.. Service was a bit slow, the wine was lovely, and I got stuck paying $20 again for incredibly mediocre vegetables. Seasoning, people, seasoning!\n\nNo bread this time around and my friends seemed to think the food was okay (one of which has been spoiled with Italian cooking from his mum) but it was nothing special.\n\nVeggies beware: you'll pay a lot of money to be incredibly bored/underwhelmed with the food."
1,"Good meat sandwiches that work well after a long night of drinking. The nyc style of the counter,  the entry,  the black and white tiled floor is all great. \n\nI've had both the corned beef and the pastrami. Pastrami is much better. I had the corned beef hash too. It says comes with a fried egg. But when I ordered it no fried egg. The server then said that you have to actually request the egg specifically - even though it says it comes with a fried egg. I guess I should just be happy that it came with beef despite my not requesting it. Also it doesn't come with bread - so it's just a pile of chopped beef and oily potatoes. Pass.\n\nTry the burger place across the way instead. If you're on a corporate account then I goes this is Ok. \n\nSlow service, mediocre food and high prices make this no better than your typical mirage hotel restaurant.  Try to avoid unless you can't avoid it."
3,"My daughter's absolute favorite sub shop -- it's not to die for, must-stop quality, in my opinion, but it's definitely a good sub!  We're here at least once a week on they way home from dance and it's both convenient and quick.  Bread and veggies are always fresh at this location which as easy as that sounds, makes a huge difference to me!  It's clean, cool and has one of those awesome soda machines with a gazillion different mix-it-up flavors!\n\nThe folks at this location are also very friendlly, very kind and will do what they need, to make your order right everytime.  Customer service is always worth exra stars for me!!"
4,"Went here for LUNCH with work mates, and man, it really doesn't get much better than this....at least for LUNCH. I had the scallops drizzled with a lemon butter sauce, with whipped potatoes and veggies. There were 6 scallops, which is a lot more than I expected (especially at \""fancy\"" places)....and they were cooked perfectly. The potatoes were divine, and that sauce was awesome.\n\nMy workmates had 2 soups...one a New England clam chowder and the other the special soup de jour of Cream of Asparagus. Both were incredible! Crab cakes, Ahi tuna salad and curry shrimp were the other dishes had. Everyone really loved the food.\n\nThe service was excellent and NOT annoying as can be at these types of places. And the atmosphere was quite nice. I can see it being quite romantic for dinner service.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent place. We'll be coming back for dinner before we see La Cage Aux Folles in a couple of weeks."
1,"I can't understand how this place got so many good reviews, unless the people leaving the reviews have never been to Belgium or Switzerland!\nService is very average not to say bad, the ladies weren't very nice I find.\nWe tried pretty much everything and none of us was convinced about any item. It is expensive and not that great. I know I won't go back :(."
2,"Why are almost all the movie theater in this town located in casinos?\n\nOh, well, not to worry, since this once is strategically located so that you walk in from the parking garage and don't have to traipse through an entire hotel, just a food court, which is pleasant window shopping for us fatties.\n\nThe theater itself is clean and well maintained, and while we didn't go on a Monday, the matinee prices were still noticeably lower than most.\n\nUnfortunately, the concession prices are not.\n\nWe were here because I had promised Little Guy an an after-school outing if he could go an entire week without showing up on the Most Wanted List at school. Imagine my surprise when the little bugger actually did it! So how could I turn down his request for popcorn even though I had smuggled my usual contraband Snickers, Kit Kats and Reese's in my purse?  \n\nI bought it, but it hurt.  Especially when I found out a few days later that he was just concealing his latest transgressions from me.\n\n\nI have no idea where he gets his criminal proclivities from."
3,"Wow, a really good experience here!\n\nI was here for a friend's birthday and therefore we had a private dinning room.  We started off with a simple salad, which was good  - fresh vegetables and minimal dressing.  My entr\u00e9e was Steak and Fries, which was really good...while it was good, I can't say it was great.  Others at the table ordered the Roasted Chicken, which was incredible!  The chicken was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasonings and remained moist and juicy...the skin was actually the best part since it was rich and crispy (butter maybe?).  I really should have had the chicken!  For dessert I had the Dark Chocolate Mousse, which was awesome - velvety and creamy, this was a perfect dessert and a great way to end the meal.\n\nThis place is pricey and fit for special occasions so make sure you dress appropriately."
2,"Went with best friend to China King because she was telling me about the Dim Sum for lunch on a Sat, when we walked in a I was impressed by the bright colors of the tables & chairs, loved it! Love details like that!  They have a wide variety of items offered and even if it's not on the carts being pushed around you can ask for it and it will be ordered up!  Also checked in on my yelp app and got a free soda, which I turned into a ice tea, but how cool is that!"
0,"I love CPK, but this was the worst CPK experience I have ever had.  They must use different recipes or something because the BBQ chicken pizza (which I get every time I go here) was disgusting.  The chicken seemed undercooked or something - I actually had to spit a few pieces out.  We also split a chopped salad which looked as though it had been sitting out for a week.  There were dirty dishes sitting at several tables the entire time we were there.  No one bothered to clean anything up... and they weren't even all that busy. \n\nSave your money and get a sandwich at Port of Sub or somewhere instead... there is one very close to this CPK in the airport."
4,"Upscale Thai food.\n\nThe restaurant is very nice and clean.  The owner came by and made sure that we were happy with our meals.  My wife and her friend got the Tofu spring rolls.  They said they were very good.  The \""peanut sauce\"" didn't taste like peanut butter (which is very good) and had a nice bite to it too.\n\nYellow curry with Tofu (uber spiced) was very good as was her friend's eggplant (also uber spiced).\n\nMy Musaman Short Rib had GREAT flavor...only problem is that there wasn't more :)"
1,Don't be fooled by the photos of the rooms. The service here is horrible. I arrived with a party of four two kids and two adults. Requested a roll away bed for my son who does not like to sleep with his sister. The front desk denied me and so did her manager. They instead stated I needed to get another room. Very rude. Definitely choosing another hotel on my next stay here in Vegas.
2,"I thought it was hilarious, but many people in the audience obviously did not.  Even Frank himself made that observation.  If you aren't up to speed on the news/events that relate to his impressions, you won't get it.....half of his Farve and Madden jokes went over my head because that's not my thing, but I thought his political stabs were hysterical.  I even enjoyed the Kermit the Frog bit.\n\nThere wasn't a bad seat in the house.  The theatre was lovely and the staff was very nice.\n\nI saw the show via Fillaseat.com, so, I didn't really pay for my seat, so perhaps that's one reason I enjoyed it so much.  Had I paid as much as some of the reviewers, I might have been slightly disgruntled as well."
4,Very pleased with the service and my new glasses. Appointment was on time and the exam by Dr.Burke was very well done - he even noted that I was raising my head to look out of the bottom of my glasses. Selecting new frames was easy and an ipad helped me see what I'd look like in the new glasses. Jamie did a comparison of cost using my insurance vs their special for the week. Always happy to save a few bucks.\n\nOverall happy with 3Guys and recommend it.
1,"Ok don't all attack me at once... I'm not a big fan. I spent years in the south with some great bbq so I have yet to find good bbq outside of the south I truly love. So that's my comparison for stars....\nThe ribs were good but not as flavorful and fall off the bone as should be. The pulled chicken didn't have balance of flavor and the Mac and cheese was too runny. The little one didn't want anything to do with it. I tasted the cobbler but this is not good cobbler as barely had flavor, and cobbler probably is one of my fave desserts! \nThe line wasn't bad but we had big group so rather than everyone specializing on a meat to make really well, each group had a chef and our order took a really long time. Not good when have kids waiting! Not a big fan of tables in parking lot with dirt kicking up in my face from the wind either.\nSorry just will wait to go back down south! I might try the butcher though as an alternative.... Seemed to have an extensive selection..."
1,A little blah. Been here twice now. Both times I can help to think that my food tastes a bit like a Lean Cuisine. I love the room though. Very well decorated. Cool art. I would go back on summer nights for drinks on the patio but the food has got to get better to have a more steady clientele.
2,Decent coffee. If you need a place to be a regular Ancora is definitely not going to disappoint you. They are good people and the atmosphere follows suit.
2,"It's an older hotel, off the strip heading to the wrong part of town so a lot of local color nearby.  The rooms are adequate, beds comfy and its cheap.  We got suites with a separate meeting room and kitchen to the bedroom and lounge and for $159 a night that is a bargain if you need meeting space.  We were on a recruitment mission and people enjoyed not having to go the strip.  Parking was free and there was a convenience store right next door.  We did not eat in the hotel.  Definitely not for you if you want glitz and glamor.  Staff were friendly."
2,Must update to reflect 2 additional trips.  The quality here is up and down as you'd expect from a 24 hour bar/video poker den.  Last time my omelette was overcooked and the bacon in the omelette wasn't greate.  The service is up and down cause there aren't many people in the grill area.\n\nAll in all though - it's not a bad option.   And you might get the cook I had the first time who cooked a really nice omelette.  Sausage is still great.  French toast isn't bad but maybe a little too sweet.
2,"I'll give SLICE a nod, it definitely crosses a unique bridge between traditional South Hills style pizza and artisan pies.  After wanting to try it for a few years now, we finally made a random impulse stop on our way home on the the T.\n\nHaving remembered positive praise about the \""Fancy Pants\"" pizza, we decided to give one of those a whirl.  As others commented, super thin, crisp and chewy crust (note, don't reheat these pies in the oven or you'll be greeted with a brick), but definitely no where close to my favorite dough.\n\nThe toppings seem to be where SLICE shines.  Inventive mix-ups, quality ingredients and portion control (yes...  I said it, not every pie needs to have 10 lbs of cheese and sauce on it) create an overall enjoyable bite.\n\nI don't know what it was, but our party just wasn't digging it.  Even as I look back, I can't tell if I liked the pizza or if I was just hungry.  Given SLICE delivers, well likely give that a try next time we're in a bind for food, but I definitely don't think I'd actively seek it out with so many other great pie joints in the South."
1,"I hated the tight squeeze of this place. It's small and annoying. The width of this place is like 8 feet, and the menu is boring. I did not enjoy my experience. It's too small to accommodate groups, or even small parties of 2 people.\n\nI would no bother considering this place."
2,"This is pretty much a must stop on a visit to Las Vegas. You could never imagine they had so many M & M items available. If you can think of it, they probably have it in M & M variety there. Huge location multi stories with different items on each level. They have a movie theater there where they show a 3-D M & M movie. There are lots of characters walking around that make good photo ops. Kids would be in heaven here and kids at heart as well. You must come by and experience for yourself. Prices are ridiculously expensive, but it's Vegas and a tourist trap so double whammy."
0,"I was completely taken advantage of!!  After being told that included in the $1800.00 Viking Sewing/Embroidery machine I purchased was all software needed to accomplish my objectives, NOPE!  That will be another $700-$800.  I really relied on their expertise in getting me started and now find myself with a machine that is basically worthless since it is unable to do the things I specifically told them I needed!  I now find myself needing to spend and additional 700-800 which was NEVER communicated to me.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"
2,"No, I don't want to buy you two girls a round of shots, but I'm sure my drunk, dumbass friend does. And I'm sure he'll buy so many that I'll end up having to pay for some of it. I'm pretty sure they were pulling the price of those shots out of their asses too.\n\nI suppose I had a \""fun\"" time here. Drinks are way expensive. $5 Miller Lite. $10 shots? Do shots normally cost $10? I don't know. The music is played way too loud. One of the bartenders was extremely cute, but neither was extremely friendly. Or neither wanted to make out with me."
0,"Ugh, I just made my first Yelp retraction.  I wrote a review of Buono's right before they switched over to new management.  When I got the text from a friend, a twice a week customer to Buono's that they switched owners and the food is now garbage... it was like a family member died.  We had our daughters birthday here, our son and I used to go to lunch here every Saturday.... This was our family establishment.  \n\nSure enough my family had to try the food with the new ownership.  The pizza was garbage.  It was cheapened up... how could it be?  I was in denial.  Maybe it was an off night.  That's allowed right?  So we tried it again, this time I didn't even want to eat pizza.  I tried the meatball parm sammy (which was always my go to meal) it was horrible.  Soggy bread with tasteless meatballs... what struck me the most was this was a Friday night... it was a ghost town!  Two tables sitting at 6:30 and a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  Back in the day on a Friday night, the place was packed and an hour wait for the pizza.  \n\nWell, it looks like I am back to square one.  I need to find a pizza place.  I am so  bummed that a place I gave 2 five star reviews now get's 1 star.  Gone are the days...."
4,"Fine!  I will praise the huge corporation with a positive review, they have earned it!  Today was my second visit and the place just does it right.  Very nice staff, so much so that it is surprising and seems out of place at a non sit down get a menu restaurant.  Of course it is being run by folks from the company at the moment but hopefully that will not change once those folks leave to open the next location.   The food is above average right above McDonalds/Wendys and right near Culvers.  But it is the service.  They way they treat employees must be pretty decent, it would be hard to be that pleasant if they underpaid, overworked.  Bottom line, it is a quality product served by better people."
3,"I'm going to start off by letting you know that I had a Groupon.  When I mentioned it to our waiter Michael, he said \""no problem, we'll just deduct it from the check at the end\"".\n\nI was there this evening with my friend and my 4yr old son.  We had a wonderful experience.  So much so that I'm writing a same day review.  We started off with the goat cheese salad, the rillettes de lupin (rabbit) and a bottle of bordeaux.  The wine was delicious and the salad and rabbit so refreshing, being that it's pretty hot outside and both are cold dishes.  I ordered the boullabaise and my friend a chicken dish.  Both were solid, but I really liked the boillabaise.  Our server, again, Michael asked if my son would like anything else, like mashed potatoes or something.  I thought it was really sweet that he was concerned for his appetite, but he was doing just fine with the seafood in my dish.  Already stuffed,  \n\nI believe the owners stopped by our table, one to do a magic trick for my son and the other, I think her name was Nadia, to chat and to over stuff us full of amazing dessert.  They brought us 3 desserts, all amazing.  We left the restaurant with a feeling of euphoria that I've longed for since I moved home to Pittsburgh, after 8 years in San Francisco, in January.  There was a place in my neighborhood in San Francisco called Bistro Central Parc, which this place reminded me of a lot.  Authentic French bistro style dining.  Casual, yet delicious.  We will definitely be going back there.  My son asked if we could eat there everyday."
0,A bad joke. Took 4 and a half hours to get a set of tires. Was constantly told they will be in at any moment.
0,"AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHS\n\nThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a \""fancy\"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate, but ask your waiter for a bottle of Prosecco and he says, \""What is that?\""  We ordered a gin and tonic, watched him make it, and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice.  Who serves a drink without ice?  We had no silverware, had to request it repeatedly.  Our entrees, dessert and coffee all came out at different times.  We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.\n\nSo - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.  Pasta was just pasta.  \n\nThe atmosphere is also drab and just depressing.  \n\nAnd the split plate fee is exorbitant, so we lied and shared food anyway.  Note that our check was still nearly $300 - for only five of us!\n\nReally, truly, avoid this place at all costs unless you're looking for a good story to laugh about.  The only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of 5 with a good story to tell.\n\nThis is the second time I've been here, the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorable.\n\nAVOID!"
2,"My wife and I stumbled across Thai Grill a few weeks ago while driving through this side of town. We decided to give it a try. We ordered the Cornish hen in curry sauce and the coconut seafood. Both were pretty good though not particularly memorable. I'd go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
2,I've had better tacos at street stands. But service and ambient was good.
4,Different than any crossfit gym you've ever been to. From the moment you walk in the door one of the many coaches greets you immediately and gives you the tour of the gym. Pointing out all their unique amenities available to all members. Not only does the support and motivation from the coaches set SCF apart from it's competitors but encouragement from the other friendly members definitely creates a very welcoming community feel. And to top things off they are also active in helping the community and host monthly events to give back. I'm hooked!
0,Catelyn the blonde heavy set cashier with glasses is a rude b*tch! Store was messy & I will not return or give this store my business ever again. I love the Pet Smart off Eastern & Silverado ranch. Their staff is ALWAYS FRIENDLY & HELPFUL.
0,"I have gone to the store once 2 years ago to get a bridesmaids dress and had a good experience.  So when it was finally my turn to try on bridal gowns I decided to go back here.  I have even researched on their website the dresses I wanted to try on.  Unfortunately during my trip they did not have any of them in stock because they are part of a trunk show, which I can understand.  SInce then I have made 3 different appointments with the shop during Demetrios trunk shows with no luck of the dresses being part of it.  At this point I am really disappointed in their service and their lack of wanting to help me.  I was told by the receptionist when I made my last appointment (2 weeks ago) that she would make sure that the dresses I wanted to try on were going to be part of the trunk show.  I had my appointment for today and have been gleaming just to be able to try on the dresses!  Unfortunately when I called this morning to confirm they where there the woman who answered the phone informed me that they were not.  So I've had to cancel my appointment yet again.  I just want to try on the dresses from the Ilissa collection #526 and #518, I didn't think it was going to be this hard to try on dresses I fell in love with over 6 months ago.  If I ever get to try on these dresses I will probably change my rating, I feel like I have been strung along and lied to ... I was willing to spend 5k on a dress and unless they can pull through on their next Demetrios trunk show I will have no other choice but to take my business else where.  Please step it up Demetrios and stop lying that you will make sure you will have certain dresses that you haven't been able to get in 6 months!!!"
4,"Aye aye aye. \n\nThis is what I'm hablando about Madison. Nay. This is what I'm taco-ing about! I've long said you can take the boy outta Tucson, but you can't take the Tucson outta the boy. Ok, I haven't been saying that long, I just sort of made it up. BUT, point of the story is even though I'm midwest through and through, a little piece of me still craves carne, and TG delivers! \n\nAfter telling new friends about my need for a little Mex in the city, they suggested we meet up for a Friday taco fiesta. Glad I met them! There are oodles of entrees, some of which include rice and beans maybe? To be honest, I'm a little foggy because once I looked at the taco and sope options I was sold and couldn't make sense of the rest of the menu. \n\nChicken, steak, pork, pastor, tripe and beef tongue are your proteins, then put whatever you want underneath them. Corn tortillas will run you a $1.75 per taco and a sope (a deliciously fried tortilla that puffs up) is a super reasonable $2.50. Both are great! The sope comes with a touch more... crema, shredded cheese, beans... but don't be dissuaded by the simplicity of the tacos. They're equally as tasty with just chopped onion and cilantro. \n\nI guess when the place opened it only had seating for just a few folks, but a recent expansion to the back area and some seats at the bar make it so everyone (well, almost) can enjoy."
2,"Showed up here to eat with about 10 co-workers.  Initial service was prompt with our order taken in about 2 mintues.  Drinks arrived shortly after.  I ordered the spicy pork dish which is accompanied by a small bowl of rice and the requisite Korean side dishes.  The pork was tasty, and a bit spicy, but on the fatty side.  The sides were mostly un-remarkable.  All in all, it was fun to try something new, but there was nothing here that I experienced that would bring me back.\n\nI did read the other reviews that talked about the soups, so I might have to give it another shot ... so many places to try, so little time/money."
1,"POP QUIZ\n\nWhich of the following don't mix well?\n\nA. Oil and water\nB. Lasik surgery and coupons\nC. Sushi and buffets\nD. All of the above, but especially C.\n\nThis was pretty nasty.  I was ready to leave after the first roll came out.  The tuna was bright pink.....PINK!!!....as in neon pink like the hair on my sister's My Little Pony....neon pink like they cross-bred my maguro with a  flamingo, neon pink like...you get the point."
1,"All these years I've been waiting for a Mall of America and this crap is what we get? Went on opening weekend then again last week. It's still too crowded for an ANOTHER outdoor mall. Just a few blocks from home to shop at Trader Joe's is a plus. Nordstrom Rack was outrageously expensive and crowded so I didn't purchase anything. Old Navy had some OK deals. I don't know anybody that shops at Dillard's or Macy's anymore but Grandma's or those conned into getting their store cards. \n\nI would like to visit the Wolfgang Puck restaurant but it wasn't open yet either time I was there. I was excited and had high hopes for this \""Mall\"" but it's meh at best. \n\nI don't envision it being this busy next summer, I won't brave the heat for any of these stores. I'll go to Meadows or Fashion Show Malls instead. I love not having to drive more than a mile to shop but wish they had chosen better stores. Sur La Table is a plus and good alternative to Williams-Sonoma across from Boca Park. Rumored Apple store will be more convenient. \n\nIt's just okay. I hope it gets better. I'll update later when they open everything."
4,"Hogs Heaven is a new joint that opened in NLV. Ok for one thing what attracted me is - Hog's Heaven....means PIG - to a filipino it means..YUM. But the picture of a pig with wings and a halo....BURNING IN FIRE....made me laugh. This isn't a restaurant. More like a takeout delivery place. We were greeted by:\n\""Hi How are you?\""  ~ Service with a smile.\n\""Good....\"" ~ Universal answer for that statement.\n\""Do you like baby back ribs?\""  \n\""yea\"" ~ Universal answer for that statement\n\nSounds of loud blues music playing in the background, and watching the guy in the back on the grill with my sample ribs.\n\nAs I sunk my teeth into these ribs my eyes opened up and mouth watered with joy when pulled the meat ever so tenderly off the bone...\nYes people. As long as I lived. This is by far the greatest babybackribs I have ever had. So I got a rack. Some coleslaw which was pretty good. But I've had better. Mac and cheese - REALLY GOOD. I would say top 5 mac and cheese's I've had. \nDude seriously. I had it again for an Easter party. We ordered 4 racks. I was told by old people that these were the best ribs they've ever had. No you don't understand. IT'S FANF*CKINGTASTIC. I don't label a lot of things that. But this is definitely worth it. I can't wait to go back!!!"
2,"Got a great coupon book from the Southpoint so decided to check this place out since we had $30 in free play..which we primarily used for dinner.  Buy one entree, get one free.\n\nThe setup primarily felt like something straight outta the 50s.  The music was also primarily weird.  It was like someone hit the demo button on a Casio keyboard or something.  \n\nWaitress was nice.  My wife got the Southpoint cut and I got the blackend/Cajun cut.  Both cuts were better than buffet cuts..leaner and thicker but I preferred her cut over mine..primarily due to the blahness of the spice/flavor on the cajun cut.  I ended up scraping off the spice off my cut.  Our entrees came with salad which consisted primarily of lettuce and a side.  My wife got the rice pilaf which wasn't very good and I got a dry baked potato.  We were too full for dessert primarily due to the serving portion of the prime rib.  \n\nI also overheard a guy at another table complaining about the dryness of his chicken.  Not sure why he would opt for chicken at a place that primarily serves prime rib.  \n\nDecent meal for the price but I think the Orleans buffet would be a better pick, especially w/o a coupon."
2,"This place is a few blocks from our house.  We don't come often but it is always good.  \n\nAlthough they get you on the happy hour..sushi for $1 really means one piece of sushi for $1.  Not really worth it.  You are better off getting the 2 rolls for $8.95 or something like that.\n\nThey automatically add gratutity to their bill.  How can you fight it?  I mean, sometimes they are worth 15% tip, but most of the time they are not.  This place is a hit or miss."
0,These tools want to charge $3 to enter just grab lunch and place a bet on the horses. I would avoid it just on that principal alone.
4,I decided to try this place because I was looking for a good sandwich.   Looking at all the reviews everyone said to try the Bobbie.   I'm glad I listened to all the reviews because the Bobby was a great delicious sandwich.  I'm from San Diego and just found out they have a location near my house.   WOO-HOO
3,"We always do steakhouses primarily when dining in LV, but we thought we would give Shibuya a try to mix things up.  We experienced the fall tasting menu one year ago, and I just looked at the current fall tasting menu and it doesn't look like they changed too much.\n\nThe edamame was great.  The hubby had the rock shrimp tempura and I enjoyed a preparation of cod two ways.  Both the appetizers and entrees were delicious, but we weren't too impressed with the sampling of desserts.  Hubby also enjoyed the sake sampling...it about knocked him on his arse!  The sake was very clean-tasting though!\n\nService was excellent and we were seated at a table in front of the bar area.  It was entertaining to see the images and colors change on the bar back wall as well.\n\nI will rate 4 out of 5 stars mainly because we felt hungry about an hour later, hahaha."
1,"I love the Hard Rock as a property, and want to love all the food options as well, but wouldn't make the effort to return here. Funniest item was a honey almond micro brew from WI which came in a can so large that it was impossible to finish-good thing for beer I guess! Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night. Seems like an adequate option if you want drinks and bar food in an interesting vibe-but don't come hungry and expect to fill up unless you order plenty and if eating healthy is the idea-would pass also. Most of the rave food options are fried and heavy on fat loaded dips-maybe the right idea to ward off a hang over.."
2,It was alright.  The pictures we saw on yelp inspired us to go.  The service and ambiance was great but the food was a tad bit underwhelming.  \n\nI would give it a second shot as there were other items that sounded good but as of now 3 stars from me. \n\nLiquor and wine list is very extensive which is a plus.
0,"It seems really calm at first, but the service wasn't the best. Everyone around us was getting excellent service & it seemed to be because they were the same race. I felt very unwelcome just because of the color of my skin. & they wouldn't give us water & rushed us out of there. When we went to pay they just said the price, nothing more, nothing less. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are not of the race because they will disrespect you."
1,"Get your moldy veggies here! \n\nIt's a practical place, but seriously, weed out your veggies when you fill up the bin. I don't need to see white moss everywhere. Other than that it's fine."
0,"I am working on a quilt  and was trying to color match the pattern I had. I found someone, her name was Gail,  and asked for help. After a dramatic sigh she went over to the section and said this is all we have and I asked if I could find more online and she says I don't know you'll have to look. .. So I walked away and took my business else where."
0,"I've gone here for lunch a few times, since it's close to my office.  The food is decent, not really a Brooklyn Deli, but good sandwiches.  This week I went again, and the level of service was horrible.  \n\nThe line when I arrived was around 15 people.  Half the staff was not servicing the line, and a couple others appeared to be just wondering around, not doing anything.  When I finally got to the counter after 15 minutes of waiting,  instead of them making my sandwich, a different employee started arguing with them about how they had screwed up previous orders.  So they argued about this for a while before one of them stoppe makingthe sandwich he was making to remake others, all while the counter was full of people waiting to eat.  \n\nWhen I finally got my sandwich I had to wait in another large line to pay.  They had one person working the cash register, and he was clearly overwhealmed and confused.  They did not have anyone try to come help him.  I was finally able to pay and get my lunch, in all it took 30 minutes to get a sandwich made.  \n\nI emailed the manager to let him know about the experience, he made some excuses, didn't seem to care about his employees taking a half hour to make a sandwich.  \n\nI think there used to be a different manager there who always worked the register, and things ran smoothly, but the last couple times he has not been there."
2,"Not a lot to say. In and out really quick for a couple guitar wall hangers. Pretty tough to say a lot about this place, so it's tough to give it a real good or bad rating.  I'm not a guitar player and haven't played my saxophone or the piano since high school.\nService seemed friendly, the host girl at the front door was nice and told us where to find what we came in looking for. The guy that helped us was friendly and checked us out quickly and the prices were comparable to what we could have got shipped to us from an online store. (but we'd rather help out the local business owners and give them some turnover)\n\n3 stars"
0,"I was very disappointed in this store. We went to buy trees for our yard and found some that we liked. However, when we tried to buy them, the owner told us that the tags on the trees were last year's tags and the prices would be higher. Even at the higher price, the trees were a good value. I am not disputing that.  However, the customer should be shown a CORRECT price on the item, not told when ready to buy it that it is higher than posted. We were ready to buy five trees and wound up buying none. We had two other people along with us who also thought that the price in the item should be the price paid by the customer. None of us will be going back."
1,"We decided to try the Penguin \""diner\"" once for \""brunch.\""  The restaurant didn't open when we thought it might for brunch (I think it might have been noon?) and then there was a rush of people to be seated.  Thankfully, we were near the front of the crowd and got seated.  \n\nWe got our brunch menus and found that...brunch consisted of their lunch menu.  No egg dishes.  So we had hot dogs for brunch.  The hot dog with pimiento cheese and chili sounded yummy, but it felt kind of awkward ordering the \""Winky Dinky Dog\"" from the tattooed, pierced waitress.  We passed on their unique fried pickles (I don't care for regular pickles, so I don't think I'd like 'em breaded and dipped in grease!).  \n\nIf I was younger (and I mean really young), I might enjoy the Penguin more, but the air was stale, the room was small, the food was average, the \""diner\"" was more like a shack, and the brunch...wasn't brunch."
3,"A little hard to find with no sign indicating that its Dick's but it has a nice dim atmosphere. Service was good too. I order the pasta and it wasn't that good, but everything else that was ordered to my table was pretty tasty!"
0,"Had reservations today at 1pm for 15 people for Mother's Day. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. It started out bad and never recovered. The waitress came over for drinks when we first sat down, and she knew we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. She obviously wasn't paying attention to our table because once everyone arrived we waited for about 15 minutes before we had to go track her down. Then it took another 20 minutes just to get our buffet plates. WHY?????? She was good after that about bringing clean ones, but didnt remove a SINGLE dirty plate. We ended up piling them on the table behind us. Now on to the food. When we arrived about 1/3 of the food was gone. Most of what was left was cold, and sitting in nasty grease. Being pregnant, there's NO WAY I'm eating room temp chicken or beef.  90% of the fruit was gone, the pasta salad and deviled eggs were not being kept cool. When we asked the waitress about it she said they were working on replacing the food. Not until we were almost done did some things get replenished. In hindsight, we should have ordered from the menu but even that took forever for some in our party and the place wasn't even full of patrons. During the entire time we were there, no one got offered drink refills. I had to flag another waitress down to get water for my kids because she forgot. At the end of the meal getting our checks she had the nerve to add 18% gratuity for the large party. Normally I don't mind, in fact I usually tip 20% as a rule. But in NO WAY did she even come close to earning it. Needless to say, we won't be back."
2,"I made reservations in advance and then called to confirm and let them know it was a special occasion.  All was good, just not over the top in terms of excellent service.  The hostess did good, the server did good and the food was 3.5-4 stars.  Salmon was good but didnt have the wild caught flavor of most salmon I've personally caught.  Maybe the salmon they serve is a different species.  No worries. Still very good.  I had the tenderloin speciality prepared very nicely over a grits and feta concoction.  Excellent flavors....just not super hot when it arrived at the table.  Over all setting is nice....nothing super wow in terms of romantic, but comfortable.  Yes, I would recommend for very good food at a very fair price."

1,"If you are expecting a wonderfully authentic Cuban meal, you will be sorely disappointed. \n\nDECOR:  This is a former dive bar, and it still looks like a dive bar.  It's poorly lit, with aging tables.  Looks more like a seedy bar you would see in the beginning of Scarface, when they are still trying to rise to the top.  \n\nSERVICE:  We ordered a Jerk Chicken and another chicken dish.  Since you could see into the kitchen, we observed they had one person preparing the meals.  Our food too about 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  We were the only guests in the place when we ordered.  \n\nThe bar staff was very friendly.  \n\nFOOD:  Meh.  My jerk chicken portion was large, but very dry.  Instead of marinating the chicken breast, they merely poured a very sweet, but not very flavorful sauce over it.  There was no heat to it.  The same could be said of my guest's meal.  Very dry and not very flavorful.  \n\nI also had rice and beans.  They were cooked properly, but again, did not have the flavor profile you would expect from a Latin-themed restaurant.  Very bland.  \n\nMost of the options are beef or pork, which is to be expected from a Latin restaurant.  If you do not eat red meat, or are vegetarian, your options will be limited.  \n\nPRICES:  For the portions you receive, they are fair.  The quality of food, however, made us feel they were overpriced.  \n\nOVERALL:  Great theme, but the mediocre food and depressing decor will likely lead me to not return.  Disappointed, because I had high expectations from the other reviews."
0,"I think the only word you really need to know is: COCKROACHES... yes indeed we had one walk up the table and perch himself over our table, when we brought it up to the waitress she had us stand up and then reached over and killed it with a napkin (while our food was still on the table). She didnt even apologize, she just brought the check over. That is pretty horrible, the owner or manager doesnt even come over? So we brought her back and asked for some kind of discount since its nasty as hell in there and we were all nauseously trying to keep the \""Indian\"" food down. (and yes it gets scare quotes because that was some shitty \""Indian\"" food.. have you ever had a palak paneer without cream? made with frozen spinach????) So she goes to talk to the guy behind the bar and then just throws the bill on the table without a word... If we were jerks about it that I would understand but no we were pretty nice about the whole deal...  so my husband goes to the guy behind the bar and he then gives us a 10% discount, spluttering, \""the place upstairs was just fumigated\"" yeah right... and my name is Kumar....its quite concerning that a roach is just going to show up on the wall and chill out under bright lights... that usually is indicative of an infestation. \n\nBut mostly it was just the way the owner/manager and the waitress treated us. we didnt put your roach there dudes,  have some graciousness and treat us nice, say your sorry, come over to our table, take a meal off the bill, give us a glass of wine or a dessert. SOMETHING. \n\nI felt like these people just want you to go, eat like cows at their buffet trough then F off and leave them money. it was horrible."
0,"The wait here was horrible.  I was trying out Tropical Smoothie Cafe and got the Lean Machine. I asked what their Turbinado additive was and I was NOT impressed either.\n\nThe \""Lean Machine\"" drink was OK. Not worth the 15 minute wait... AND they weren't even busy.  I was warned my by friends about this place, but tried it anyway.\n\nThe guy at the counter was not very friendly either.\n\nNever coming here again."
0,"I had pretty high hopes for JET as my friends were excited about it, but I wasn't impressed in the least. It was huge, dark and there were bored girls in rolled up athletic shorts \""pole dancing.\"" The line was absolutely huge outside, but hardly anyone was actually inside. Despite this, the security staff kept telling us to move to different parts of the hallway by the bar. I'm still not sure why, because there wasn't any traffic. Very disappointing and absolutely not worth waiting in that giant line outside."
4,"The best type of restaurant is where they know your order before you even order. The sushi chefs juan and chuie are awesome and always makes our sushi quick and yummy. My favorite nigiri's are seared garlic salmon, crispy unagi and scallop mayo. Some rolls worth trying is the makaha, maui wow wee and joes special. My favorite part about this ayce is their appetizers. Dishes ranging from baked mussels to kalbi and hamachi kama are all so yummy. \nIf you become a regular make sure you enroll in their loyalty program. They give your points for every dollar you spend and if when spend $250 you get a $25 credit."
2,How are you out of tofu for the miso soup? Ugh! The sushi is a little on the pricey side (at least a dollar more per roll than similar places) but it's the only sushi spot on the boardwalk so I've been here more times than was warranted by the quality of the sushi.
4,Amazing indoor pistol shooting range and retail store. Much better then anything available in California. Selection and staff support was good including plenty of 5.56  / 223 ammo for purchase.
2,"Okay , what am I doing at a Filiberto's? That was the question of the evening, but it was Thanksgiving Eve and I had food to make , kids to quickly feed and my home from college daughter had a friend to meet nearby. So Filibertos it is. I ordered my traditional Mexican fast food  meal a  red  bean burrito.  Whoopee ..no big deal ..nothing to taste, blandness with  a wad of shredded cheese at the bottom...didn't get sick even though I have heard stories.   Place was clean and seemed  okay  . Girls thought theirs were just okay.  No harm no foul.  But I am not going back."
3,This is the best place to relax and have an amazing sandwich.
0,I think for a Saltimbocca 33 $ plus side spinac 9 $ plus side poteto 9 $ \nin the end I paid one Saltimbocca 51 $ \nand wos the worse saltimbocca you can eat sorry i really like the place but the food is over price and the  don't mach with the price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,The orangicle drink here is amazing and the place is very spacious and comfortable.  Their logo with the goat holding a mug of coffee is awesome.  I definitely prefer this franchise over Starbucks.  It is too bad it is only found in Pittsburgh.  I hope they expand.
0,"Despite having a room on a non-smoking floor, the occupants of the adjoining room were smoking what was very likely marijuana. The smoke from their room seeped into our room through the service door, as well as into the hallway. As a result, our room had a very strong smell in it. While the bell desk did send someone up to spray our room and warned our neighbors not to smoke, the reprieve from the smoke smell was temporary. After leaving our room for a few hours, we found that our neighbors had smoked yet again, stinking up our room and requiring a second visit from housekeeping.\nTo make matters worse, despite our pleading, we were told that we would not be able to change rooms until the following night. As a result, we were forced to endure a full night of the stench of drug smoke.\n\nIt is understandable to not want to embarrass your guests by \""busting them\"" for bad behavior (after all, Vegas strives to be an adult playground). If a hotel is going to allow such bad behavior in a guest however, it should not be at the expense of another guest. If someone wants to stink up there room with smoke, so be it, but don't make us have to suffer through it too.\n\nWe've shared our experience with all of our friends and will most certainly never stay here again."
1,"The shuttle guy from the hotel recommended this place. I realize I am from Texas, so getting good, authentic Cajun food isn't hard. With that said, this place is awful in terms of food. I ordered the crawfish andouille flatbread, and it was terrible. Firstly, it wasn't a flatbread; it was a pizza. Secondly, there was brown oil dripped from the andouille, which made the pizza soggy. Thirdly, because the pizza was soggy, it was hard to eat. I was picking at it so badly that the waiter and the owner talked me into getting another dish.\n\nI decided on the Scallop Mac Daddy. It was better, but not by much. I've decided seafood and macaroni & cheese probably aren't the best combination. The scallops were big (see picture), which was good, but they gave the mac & cheese a weird flavor. I realize the two dishes I picked aren't true NOLA style, but there's no crawfish etouffee on the menu (blasphemy in my book)! In fact, most of the dishes aren't really indicative of NOLA, in my opinion.\n\nThe long island was terrible. The bartender used spiced rum instead of normal rum, and this always makes a long island un-drinkable. I had already sent back a dish, so I didn't want to complain about the drink too, but I only took two sips. I left a full drink behind.\n\nThe only good thing from the meal was the caesar salad. I don't like anchovies on pizza, but I do like anchovies in a caesar salad. The salad had fresh ingredients, was crispy, and light. But after spending $45, including tip, the meal was not worth it. I will not come here again."
3,"I stayed here recently while passing through Vegas on a road trip to LA.  I'm not a fan of the Strip at all, so I liked the far off location.  This hotel was like a beautiful oasis in a city I otherwise detest.  The pool, the spa, the landscape - everything was gorgeous (except the icky casino).  The rooms are HUGE!  Very well done too - everything had been recently updated.  I was dying to get into the spa bathtub, but just didn't have time.  The pool area is also really large but get there early to get a prime spot in the sun (or under the umbrella).\n\nI had to take a star away for the lack of decent restaurants.  There were like 5 or 6 on-site, but they were all kind of crappy.  And avoid the Irish pub on Sat. nights - the band is GOD AWFUL."
3,This place is worth all the hype it is a great sandwich for a good price. It just sucks its IN the planet hollywood i wish it was off the strip.
2,Good wholesome baked goods with no added preservatives or fake stuff. Their cookies are very good.
4,"I have four pets and occasionally have my mother's dog here also, and I take all of them to Lakeview.  The vets and staff at Lakeview are wonderful and they've taken fantastic care of my elderly cats, who have many ongoing health issues, as well as my young and very energetic dog, who has allergies.  My dog is easily frightened, but loves to kiss everyone at Lakeview.  The vets have helped me a lot with cat medications in the form of topical gels and treats that I can administer easily, especially to my feral cat.  I think I've seen each vet there by now and each one has been thorough, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Yes, the examining rooms are not at all soundproof, but that's the only thing I would change there.  It was a big relief to find such a great veterinary clinic when I moved here and I recommend them highly."
3,"Got a #5 from them tonight after a busy day with a soda.  The order taker was very kind and efficient.  I had to repeat myself a few times but I think that was due to a bad connection.\n\nThe driver was very nice (and I will admit rather cute).  The sandwich was delicious.  She forgot the drink, but I called the store and they sent out the driver with it a few moments later along with a treat to make up for the inconvenience.  \n\nThe crew and food was great, the honest mistake was made up for by a great act of customer service.  I would recommend this location to anyone in the area that enjoys great subs and great service."
4,"Patties Rocks.  Great drinks, fast service, ping pong, juke box, thats all I remember..."
2,"Pretty things, ridiculously expensive.  If you have the discretionary funds to overpay, you'll have fun here!  Otherwise, you can find quality, similar (if not the same) products elsewhere, where they haven't been marked up 400-500% !  Meanwhile, it's a lovely store & enjoyable to visit."
3,"Nice, no-frills but cute place that's a great option for weekday brunch. We came late on a Monday afternoon, I think, and there was only one other table taken. \n\nI wouldn't say it was the *best* eggs benny I've ever had, but it was very good, and the number of variations they have on the classic is great. There were a few vegetarian options, which is nice. I got the eggs florentine (sans jambon) and my boyfriend got the vege-pesto -- pesto mixed into the hollandaise, over sauteed veggies (peppers? squash? I forget.) It was amazing. My florentine was good, but not amazing. \n\nThe home fries were the main area that needed improvement -- they were just not very compelling. Coffee was acceptable. Service was friendly and quick. Art on the walls was excellent!"
0,"It's Monday at 9am and they are not open for breakfast like their sign says. \""Daily 6-10am\"""
3,"With little to show from our shopping adventure, my friend and I treated ourselves to some refreshments before heading back out into the searing Vegas heat. \n\nOnce we walked in, the initial greeting was a good way to start our experience. The girls were quick to see if we were ready and then waited for us to make up our minds. A great thing about this place is that they know their clientele very well. I love how they list the item, price, and caloric value. My pomegranate ice tea was around four dollars and my friend's mango smoothie was $5.25. For the size, and where we were, this was a reasonable, if not surprising price. I was expecting something smaller as well. I wondered why ice tea would be 200 calories and then found out that they use the Odwalla pomegranate juice and plenty of it. The drink was tart and strong. It took a few sips to adjust, but this person who normally complains that food could use more of a zip was reeling. It was refreshing. The mango smoothie was sweet. I could not drink too much of it, but that is probably because I knew that one cup held 400 calories. Maybe what initially impressed me is more of a double edge sword."
1,"Not great, but they're open way late and prices are reasonable. Noodles were a little soggy.\n\nI'd had a bit much too drink and the bartender told me the Thai place in Aria was still open, so there we went. \n\nReally not that memorable but it hit the spot and was much needed! \n\nAnd oh yeah, the \""Shrimp egg rolls\"" are just sort of battered prawns, like hors d'oeuvres at a fancy wedding or something, rather than like real egg rolls."
4,"I was not physically at the boutique for this shopping experience, but I know the staff here are wonderful.  \n\nMy mother and sister came here a while ago to get me a purse. I had to work, so I could not accompany them to Vegas. Thus, buying me the purse was very difficult since I was not physically there to select the one I want. So, my mother and sister had to shop for me and they said the staff there were very nice, patient, and understanding of my dilemma. \n\nMy mother and sister went to the boutique a total of 3 times before I was able to select the perfect one. My sister literally took and sent me dozens of pictures of my mother modeling the purses so that I can have a precise image of how big the purses are and how they looked. The staff were so nice about that, especially since most designer stores do not allow you to take pictures.\n\nI ended up buying their anniversary purse with the lizzard embossed print in black. I love it, It is absolutely beautiful and I get so many compliments from it. The purse itself is so casual yet classy, its just goes with everything."
2,"I got in for free with an offer on my StripSteak reciept.  I wouldn't pay $20 to come up here, and pay $16 for a Martini. \n\nThe view was real cool.  Very nice elevator ride to one of the top floors in TheHotel.   \n\nTotal cockfest here.  Nearly all well dressed older men.. likely guys with money.  Where were the gold diggin girlies?   Well, the female staff were fishin for tips, I guess that counts? \n\nI was surprised to see they had a dessert menu.  Chocolate Souflee, MIX signature candy bar, and a few other things.  I settled for the Candy Bar after asking the staff if it was good.   It wasn't that good.  It had an awful coffee taste to it, and was small.  No way worth $14...maybe $4-$6.. \n\nI balked at the expensive drinks (the bottle menu started at $100, and average was $250-$400)\n\nI settled for a $5 soda. Yup, five bucks for 1 glass of coke.\n\nThe place was full of men, so I hightailed it out of there.  This was I believe around 11ish on a Wed night.   \n\nOverall, if it's free check it out, but everything up there is overpriced.  Not worth the $20 IMO."
4,"OMG best burger joint ever and with that friendly neighborhood feel that makes you think you're back East. Get the sweet potato fries. They come with a sugary dip that is freaking redic. I like topping my burgers with herbed goat cheese, spinach and their creamy balsamic. So so good!! I can't wait to go again."
0,"Very clean. The staff isn't very friendly or helpful though. My nail tech actually stopped to chat on her cell phone at one point which I found to be quite rude. I got a full set of pink and whites. My nails looked great when I left, but I quickly realized that my index finger nail was significantly crooked.\n\nI would not recommend this place to a friend and I will not be returning."
3,"You have to give it FRC.  You're going to get a good meal at any of his restaurants, but True Food is one of the best.  I have dreams about the edamame dumplings, and have been known to have 3 orders as an entree-don't miss out on these.  Although I usually go salad, today I had the Tuna sliders with a small kale salad and of course, the dumplings.  The dumplings were great as usual.  The Tuna sliders didn't blow me away, but they were solid.  I'd like for them to have a little more of a spicy kick, but that's just me- they were still very good.  Also, don't forget their drinks-you'll love the selection.  \n\nChow away!"
0,"My girlfriend and I showed up at 7:25pm on a weekday night and placed our order for two rolls shortly after. We didn't receive our food until 8:15pm!  It shouldn't take 45 minutes to prepare two rolls. We had a table next to us that had sat down 20 minutes after we arrived. They brought out their food 15 minutes before ours and they had about 6 rolls. I wasn't happy to see some of the workers sitting at the tables talking to friends or family members when food is taking so long to bring out. At the time there was only one waitress working the entire dinning room floor. The food was average, but they lost me as a customer with the terrible service."
1,"Showroom at South Point is an interesting joint, I went here for a post Yelp UYE to see the Spazmatics. We bought VIP ticket for $10 with 2 free drinks and a private booth, which is a good deal. However, you get what you pay for. The VIP line was the last one to go into the theater, the show started at 10:30 and we got in around 10:45. The Spazmatics are good, but I wasn't their target audience. The drink orders took between 30-45 minutes, and they are really watered down. VIP booths are much closer to the stage and the dance floor. \n\nOverall (2/5), VIP tickets are only worth it if you're gonna drink."
0,"Heading back to LA and our Toyota dies, 60 miles out of Vegas at around 5:30PM. We had it towed with our AAA towing company to Findlay Toyota for $512. even with a AAA discount. No sooner had we droppped off the car after the service was closed than the sales 'manager' and an accomplice drive up and almost immediately try and sell us a new Toyota. We nicely decline and mention we just need our car evaluated first thing in the AM when the service opens and possibly repaired and we would be on way. These attempts to sell a new car were tried via cell phone all into the next day, 3 times total to sell us a car we could neither afford or want. The only silver lining in this company was the the service technician 'Chuck Griffin' was a prince to deal with. Although we decided to shop the service a little, he was a good and honest man to talk and deal with. We had our car towed again to another location for less than half what the repairs were quoted and needless to say we will never return to this place again nor do we recommend them."
4,"Found this place on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised to find high grade sushi, large portions, creative dishes from sushi chef Yeung, very pleasant service and great wine selection! Being a foodie who loves wine pairing and dines out 99.9% of the time, we finally found our twice weekly sushi place!"
1,"I was super excited to stay here thinking it would be one of the better hotels in Vegas. I was wrong and it started that way at check in.\n\nThere were no clear lines so we just got in line behind a couple that was already checking in. When the couple finished, and walked away, we looked at the desk lady and she called us over. As we were walking up, some douche bag who worked there zooms in front of us, puts his arm out in front of my boyfriend and gestures for another couple to come over and be helped by this lady who already called us over. When we told him we were waiting in line and that the lady had called us over, the guy than said oh I didn't see you there. But I will find you a line as he walks off to talk to other people.. No apology at all, and the couple he rushed in front of us had walked in behind us. \n\nI turn around to look for my sister, and she was with another desk clerk checking in. I walked over to her and let her know if the guy she was working with, if we could get two rooms on the same floor. The guy than said, the rooms were not ready and they only have one room ready with a king bed. WTF what happened to reservations we made two months ago?? I know we're ten minutes early to the 3'o clock check in time but that shouldn't matter. So I asked when the second room would be available and he said he didn't know. But could offer us two rooms with two queen beds instead. We just took that, it was raining out, I was tired of the hotel already. \n\nThe rooms were ok, nothing fancy, not worth the hype of Bellagio at all. My room had chocolates left or us, but my sister's did not. Inconsistency. \n\nI didn't find this out till the last day, but my sisters room reeked of smoke and she definitely does not smoke. But she just got used to the smoke of Vegas so she didn't smell it in her room.  But I did and I know for a fact that we reserved two non smoking rooms. \n\nAh, and upon getting home, we find out the hotel charged my sister an extra 100$ to her bill. She had no extra services at the hotel, barely even spent time in her room.\n\nBellagio, clean up your act. I had a better stay and a nicer room at NewYorkNewYork."
4,"The Suicide Wings and big, cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer on tap will make your eyes roll back in your head!  Warning, they are addicting and you will find yourself sneaking there at all times during the day and night to fill this insatiable urge. You can get both in the bar or restaurant part of the pub.  The bartenders and waitresses are super friendly. Experience this ASAP!"
4,Spent two weeks in Las Vegas last year for my honeymoon and finding this little spot at 1am is still one of the greatest highlights of the entire trip.  I let everyone know who tell me that they're going to vacation in Vegas that they MUST try this place!!!! Go now!!! Why are you still reading this?!?
4,"This is either the best steakhouse I've ever been to or it's in the top two. \n\nItems ordered (with my comments):\n\nApps\nDuck fat Fries - Truffle sauce was my favorite\nFilet Tartare - Wonderful! You must get this.\nDuck - Very good.\n\nEntrees\n8oz American Kobe Rib Cap - One of, if not the best steak I've ever had.\n8oz American Kobe Kobe Filet - Good.\n18oz Dry-Aged Bone-in Rib eye - 2nd best steak I tried. I would order this every time if the Rib Cap was not available.\n\nSides\nMac & Cheese truffled - Amazing! Get this too!\nPotato Puree Trio - Lobster and horseradish were my favorite.\nBaby Brussels Sprouts - A little salty, but really good.\nRoasted Mushrooms - Delicious\nScalloped Potatoes - Good\n\nI was fortunate that we had a lot of people there and we all shared items. If I was ever going by myself, this would be my order:\n\nApp\nFries\nFilet Tartare\n\nEntree\n8oz American Kobe Rib Cap or 18oz Dry-Aged Bone-in Rib eye (edge to Rib Cap)\n\nSide\nMac & Cheese truffled"
1,"I have a couple of issues with this place, so I will start with the food first. Myself and my wife met a couple friends here for brunch last weekend. I made the mistake of ordering the \""Potato Hash\"", which turned out to be one of the worst things I've ever eaten period. It's a simple breakfast of eggs over easy, sausage gravy and hash brown potato's. My plate came out with two eggs that had been cooked so long that they were both hard and dry. There wasn't a lick of moisture left in them. The server noticed that the eggs were ruined, and promptly had more made for me. The sausage gravy was terrible. It was some weird super oily concoction that neither resembled gravy nor sausage, which made my burnt potato's even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. My second issue was my reservation. I made a reservation three days in advance for 11:30am on the patio through \""OpenTable\"". The day before my reservation the restaurant called to confirm everything for the next day. When we arrived, the hostess quickly seated us inside. I explained that my reservation was for the patio. She told us to wait and she would go find out. Several minutes later she came back and informed me that since I made my reservation through \""OpenTable\"", that my request couldn't be honored. WTH? I was told that if you want to sit on the patio, you need to call the restaurant direct, even though on OpenTable there is a box for, wait for it, special requests! Fortunately since I have no desire to return to this typical chain restaurant, I wont need to call the restaurant direct. P.S. I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it."
2,"We were drunk, partied out, and by the time we were done gambling, it was 5:30am! I love Vegas.\n\nAnyway of course we were hungry so with our winnings we decided to go to Caesar's. This spot was the only place open that early so we checked it out.\n\nThe wait for a table was pretty long, about 15 minutes. They said it was because it was so early and their staff was low. \n\nOnce seated though, service was good. I had the pancakes with eggs, home fries and sausage and the BF had a NY steak and eggs. Pretty good and their portions were HUGE. I didn't finish mine. The waiter also was attentive and kept refilling my drink as I was super dehydrated and drank like 8 glasses of water.\n\nThe cutest thing is they give you these little jars of jam and A1. I took one home to show everyone. I like to take things from restaurants as souvenirs.\n\n$50 for breakfast but hey, it was paid with money won."
1,"Started off with a bang. The appetizers were awesome (steak bruschetta and loaded tater tots). The service for our large group was very slow.  Took an hour to get our entrees.  The entrees were just ok.  No one from our group raved about their meal.  Overall, disappointing."
2,"Ok this is the Hard Rock...so everything was HARD!! check in at 11pm on a Thursday was horrible! No customer service, in fact, front desk agent, thought I was rude for approaching her while she was on the phone!! Which lead to her snatching my credit card out of my hand, calling me (the customer) rude, and saying she'd kick my husband and I out for being rude! My husband put his foot down and said I'd love to see you kick us out for us being \""rude\""! She called security and walked away! Turns out security wasn't coming to kick us out but stop the alleged drama. With that being said, a day later, report/complaint written regarding incident of inappropriate agent, and convo with manager...NOTHING DONE!!! We are still going to follow up with this! \n\nRoom was clean and cool view of pool! BUT we must have been next to a suite because Friday ppl were rocking out with DJ and all till 4am...then Saturday another check in guest hosted party in there which went from 7pm-10am next day, with music and tons of drunk ppl! Def HARD ROCK!! and the best part, nothing you can do about it AT ALL! \n\nLocation was good cuz we seen concert at the Joint. So convinent, with pre dinner and drinks! Not to mention, we were able to leave the Joint and go up to room for drinks and go back to concert in minutes to plastic cups:)\n\nIt was $14 from airport to taxi and $10 to strip everytime. \n\nI would stay here again for concert purposes but my husband says hell no:/"
1,"Bookstores are so changed.....used to be books, now its only 50% that, 25% kids toys, 20% book products, and 10% music.   Cultural shift!  Once again I get the B&N club membership pushed on me again: since I only go once at Christmas its not worth it.  Prefer small businesses."
0,"Love flammable fabrics? Aged 15 and under? Looking for an outfit to wear when you try to get into Cav at the weekend? Then Quiz is the shop for you! Beloved of chavs and tarts alike, Quiz manages to stock an astonishing range of really awful clothes - I challenge you to find me something made of natural fibres. From diamante studded vests emblazoned with words like 'Sexy' to super short dresses made from clingy neon polyester, this place has it all. Clearly I am not a fan, but I honestly can't understand why anyone would want to part with their cash in here? And, given their target market you might expect things to be super cheap, it's not; which begs the question, who are they attempting to sell this rubbish to? Gullible mothers with scant regard for their daughter's chastity is the best I can come up with."
0,Y is this place closed? Didnt pay rent?
1,Went about 1 month ago.  It was not good.  They were out of several items.  It was slow service.  They changed the menu and our two favorite items were gone.  The food we got was not very good for what we paid.  We have not been back again.  There are other places on every corner and up and down each street.    The server was nice and we could tell she was not responsible for the changes and she was feeling it in tips and number of tables she got a night.
0,"Would love to rate the food...but never got any (except for cold, crusty bread that seemed to have been soaked in olive oil).\n\nShowed up at 6:45 on Saturday night with a reservation. After ordering food and getting our drinks we never saw our waiter again except for a \""drive-by\"" (\""Everything OK here?\"" As he ran by without waiting for an answer.) After an hour with no food and no drinks past the first round I got up and went to the bar to pay for the drinks and left. While we were there we saw several waiter-less tables, including one with a dude who went to the bar to get a beer for himself since no one came his table to ask if he needed another drink.\n\nBased on other reviews, it appears Fran's never got their act together. There are WAY too many restaurants in Charlotte (and Dilworth) to put up with this. Terrible start to the weekend.\n\nTo paraphrase Keyshawn, \""COME ON, FRAN!\""\n\nWon't be back."
2,"Cool little Pittsburgh spot at the top of Mt. Washington.  Park your car, walk along Grandview enjoying the view, and stop here for a cold one (alternately, to watch the game). \n\nDecent food, great service, and great prices. \n\nA friend who is a born and bred Yinzer (spelling?) says to me, \""this is actually classy for Pittsburgh.\"" \n\nI have nothing to compare it to -- but I had a great time and I think you will too."
1,"My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that."
0,Stopped in for a late night bite to eat. Was dissapointed they changed the menu so it doesn't include chicken fried steak. Table next too us had a loud inter-racial couple playing loud youtube videos of people using the N-word multiple times. Then played one of some fat half naked person dancing at which point we promptly asked the waiter for the check. Food was good for the price. Attracts a certain croud. It is in a bad area with lots of homeless people.
1,"No matter what, I'm always waiting in a long line. The cashiers move very slowly and will hold up the line for various reasons; wrapping a customer's 10 individual mums, chatting with a regular, etc. Really unpleasant experience."
3,love the large portions
3,"I hadn't been to a Bamboo Club in awhile - mainly because they closed the one in Tempe and the one at the Biltmore, and this one on Shea is so far away from me that it's pretty darn inconvenient to go here. However, my mom was in town, and remembered how much she liked this place in the past, I had an expired Groupon with the cash value on it and time to kill, so we went for a late lunch. \n\nWe both ordered the lunch specials. What a great deal! $9.95 for 3 items. I got the wonton soup, crab puffs and the BC Spicy Chicken. The wonton soup's flavor was perfect (although the spinach in it could have been wilted a little more). The crab puffs were out of this world - filled with cream cheese and a ton of crab. I guess I have gotten used to sub-par crab puffs (or more often than not these days, they are just cream cheese puffs) - and these made me remember how to do it right. Lots of crab, and lots of cream cheese, and perfectly crispy on the outside. The BC spicy chicken was flavorful - I would say it could use a little more spice - but that's probably just my preference. \n\nWhile the place was completely dead - some locals at the bar - the service was attentive and generally good. I'm not sure what happened that they lost such a big following when I moved to PHX 10 years ago - but the food is still very good. I will definitely be back.. if I am ever again at 86th and Shea. It was a great deal for a delicious lunch."
2,"Fantastic venue for concerts, I have been there for a lot for shows. However, make sure you watch the bartenders carefully. My card was charged 3 times for the same amount because \""the credit card machine ran out of paper\"". I was not told about it, I had a hunch & immediately checked my account & saw 3 of the same charges. I was assured that the charges would be removed at the end of the night because it couldn't be removed right then (total lie!). It hasn't gone through yet. Someone needs to train these girls how to use the machine, it's not hard to press reprint!"
2,"I came here for my birthday week on a Saturday. It was a pretty cool place when I first walked and the girl at the front desk was really gorgeous looking, Which then gave me a good start of the night. I enjoyed the sushi there which were you're typical sushi like any other place. I also orders a garlic shrimp on a skewer which too was pretty tasty. The only bad experience I would have to be that our waitress was a little forgetful and slow which was a bit annoying but after a few sake shots, it didn't bother me much anymore. The lighting at the place was a a bit gloomy as well. I understand it is trying to make you feel that dim and romantic like feeling but for me it was making me sleepy along with the rest of my party. I would add this to my list of ok sushi places."
2,"This is the second time I stayed here with my b/f.  This time I was less impressed.  The staff as usual was fantastic.  They always are as helpful and as kind as ever.  Great job to you guys!  This is a business hotel so it's generally empty on the weekends, which is nice.  We had a king room on the 10th (top) floor.  Room was large enough.  Clean.  But, the heater was LOUD.  Squeaky.  So we messed with it... nada.  So we changed rooms, not a big deal.  We went right next door.  That room was the same as the last.  Downsides to this room though, the phone was dirty... I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.  Oh ,also the hot tub was down for maintence when we were there :( Bummer.  But the pool was open and no one was in it.  They also have a stellar gym.  \n\nTo recap:\n\nPROS:\nGreat Staff\nGreat location\nLarge Rooms\nNice TV\nGreat Gym\nHas a pool/hot tub\n\nCONS:\nOutdated Bathroom\nOutdated/Dirty Phones\nOver Startched Bed Linens (both rooms had the same issues)"
0,"I would give this Starbucks a 0 but it doesn't let me. Today was the 4th time I was kicked out of a Starbucks when I had my Certified Therapy Dog with me. She has a vest and I have an ID I wear. I was told today my dog can't be in the store. I have spoken with SB \""higher ups\"" in the past (when we were thrown out of other stores) and they say the staff cannot ask me about my dog or kick us out. It is against the law to throw a Certified Therapy animal out of anywhere. Starbucks has broken the law 4 times now. Not to mention humiliating & degrading me in front of other customers. I was called \""Sweetheart\"" at another location (59th and Union Hills) in front if a packed store by an employee and was told I can't have my dog in the store, even though we were both clearly marked. Today was the last time SB is throwing us out. I have contacted several news outlets. They are not only rude but broke the law, numerous times. My dog is Certified and visits Nursing Homes and Hospitals. Starbucks, you threw the wrong duo out........again."
0,"I almost never go back to a restaurant if it disappoints me the first time.  This place will not get any more of my money.  There are just way too many better options for the price, even in Surprise.  It's a little more expensive than Macayo's and not even as good.  Then there are several small Mexican restaurants in the area that are much cheaper and way better."
4,"We renewed our vows Saturday night at the Graceland Chapel with Elvis for our 17th wedding anniversary (17 on 17) and had a wonderful time.  The staff was very helpful, and even though it was quick, we did not feel rushed at all.  The Elvis (Harry) was spectacular, the photographer was really efficient --- I can't wait to see the photos (not up yet... must have had a busy weekend)!  A great time was had by all.  And our limo ride was great - we all sang along to the Elvis hits on our way there and back (the limo driver has lots of patience to listen to our caterwauling)."
2,"While on a geocaching spree with my bestie, I started to get hunger pangs on a hot summer day and thought I was going to pass out so we stopped in Mullens for some sustenance. The place was nearly empty except for a couple seated at a table and the employees. We decided to sit at the bar and each selected a seasonal brew from their limited, yet delicious draft offerings.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I had very few selections to choose from. I was limited to pizza, salad and appetizers. I opted for a cheese quesadilla and nachos. The 'dilla consisted of cheese with a teaspoon each of guacamole and sour cream. The nacho platter was ginormous and piled high, enough for 3 people.\n\nMr. Sloppy ordered a burger with tots which he thought was delicious. The food came out fast and our bartender/waiter was friendly and attentive.\n\nI could imagine this place busy before or after a Buccos game because of Mullen's convenient location, right across the street from Heinz Field. truth be told, I would rather tailgate and order nachos from the stadium... Who can resist that? With Mullen's jacked up prices, you might as well enjoy the whole ballgame experience"
1,"Ok so.. not shure the hype on this place.. \n\nOrdered white ricotta pizza that had I thin sun dried tomatoes -- OVERALLY Garlic I mean I am Italian and couldn't even take it had about half a slice that's all I could stomach. Overally olive oiled. I can tell you how to make a good pie. but not using any garlic or half that cause the other pizza we got was bland. \n\nWe also ordered a meat trio esk pizza -- The sauce well what sauce I could find was dolloped on sort of like the ricotta cheese on the other pizza, leaving gaps on non sauced areas near the crust making the crust actually taste burnt rather then tasting fresh. \n\nI was actually quite disappointed to be honest. The white pizza was meh. also the pizza sauce itself had no flavor lacking salt, even Italian Seasonings. \n\nI hope they see this. 40 something bill"
2,"I wish I could give this place 5 stars.... I came here right after they opened. Ate at the bar and had the steak sandwich which was AWESOME. Next time, I brought a friend and decided to try some pasta dish. It SUCKED. In fact they burnt the pasta and it had to go back. This is after I waited 45 minutes for the dish. \n\nWhat this has going for it is very good quality meats. The downside is the INCONSISTENCY. Some of the waiters and bartenders are good, and others horrible. \n\nLast time I sat down at the bar, hungry and thirsty after a long day, the c*nt bartender ignored me because gossiping with a waitress was more important for her. When a customer comes in, your job is to give them a menu and take a drink order ASAP. Get it?  \nThis is not a place I would consider for any important date or business dinner again. \nThey have a good idea, but execution is clearly a problem here. \n\nI have a suggestion for management: you are a f*cking steak house. So hire some REAL waiters. Not bimbos based on looks. And get your kitchen in order. Try to be a real steakhouse like Peter Luger etc. You have the potential, and this town needs it."
1,"I'm not sure how old the hotel is, but it seems dated. The carpet in the hallway is wrinkled, there wasn't any grout around the bath spout.  I waited in line 25 minutes to check in. \n\nThe price was reasonable."
2,"I would agree partly with the above previewer but also I would say that Dr.Ponitch is just old school. He likes to get right to it and will give you direct answers. Like most doctors, they're not going to sit and have a 30 min appt to talk about every single medical problem you have. I've always found Dr. Ponitch and his receptionists to be kind and professional. I have returned and will continue to return to him for minor dermatological issues."
0,"So friends and I had given our first try at the Wicked Spoon for lunch, we hated it, others kept saying it was good but you have got to hit up the dinner. We said okay let's give this one more chance. Verdict? Still hate it. \n\nWe were hungry and beat the dinner rush by arriving around 5 for dinner. Our first plates seemed promising, I picked up a tasty shrimp ceviche, duck taco and the ginormous bone marrow. Liked 2 out of the 3 (bone marrow was not what I was used to, but maybe because I missed the little bowl of chimichurri on the side). All the following plates were a major disappointment. Even some of the crab legs were kind of questionable. Honestly the presentation is exceptional, but really I'm only there for the food. To add insult to injury the food at the buffet gave me quite the raging case of food poisoning which is not fun when you've got a 4hr car ride back to LA. \n\nThis buffet is banned for life."
3,"this is probably the third restaurant i tired in Glendale, AZ...It is located in a historic site in Glendale and all the houses around it are also little shops that sells antiques and trinkets. The restaurant has a very cozy and homey touch and a nice little outdoor patio seating area.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is quite small...maximum capacity is about 25. We sat by the door and since my bf got a little cold the really nice waitress moved us further in the restaurant. The lady who served us might also be the owner...but she was very friendly and nice.\n\nSo I ordered something called the Combo...it came with 6 potato-cheese pierogi and a smoked kielbasa sauteed with onions. OMG the smoked kielbasa was huge! it was at least 9 inches!! =D it was also very yummy! the potato-cheese pierogi was a little bland by itself but dab a little bit of sour cream on it..it was pretty good. I really enjoyed my dish and I was close to finishing it but since the waitress gave us some bread and butter, I got pretty full. \n\nMy bf ordered the smoked Polish sausage on a roll ciabatta with cold sauerkruat slaw. It was also very huge..and looked really yummy too. he also ordered a cup of cream of potato...which i  thought wasn't creamy enough but was still okay.\n\nThe entr\u00e9es are a bit expensive per person...average $14 but if u order just a sandwich with water then it's about $8.\n\nAnother thing about this place that might be cool for those who drink is that you can bring your own beer and wine without charge. =D\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the food and service. She made a mistake on the bill...charging us $33 instead of $27..she was nice and apologetic about it so we tipped her more. =D I would love to come here again!"
3,"Very good food and service at reasonable prices for a Vegas hotel restaurant.  House wine was very drinkable.  Food quality was excellent.  Very good, properly prepared pasta.  Wonderful service.  The reason for only 4 stars is that the restaurant is hard to find in the labyrinth of the Venetian hotel, which was frustrating.  Parking is free in the hotel lot."
4,"This is one of best restaurants I have been to.  We went here for my friend's 50th birthday dinner.  I made reservation for 6 people.  We were seated right away at a table inside with a view for Bellagio fountains.  LOved the view.  The staff were so friendly and helpful and patient.   We briefly mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and they brought out a little dessert for her.  Each of us ordered a different type of steak.  We actually tried all of the steaks.  each steak entree was about mid 20s price range.  We certainly come back.  Next time, we want to come back for breakfast."
4,"Hey, it IS a Target, you all should know what that is like.  \n\nWhat I like & appreciate about this store:\n- Usually very clean\n- Not crowded\n- Well Organized\n- I swear, the same clerk/customer service staff for the last 10 years\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- The height of the speed bumps in the parking lot\n- The lack of shade provided by the north side of the building when it gets past April.\n- I guess that is it.\n\nShort & sweet ;-)"
0,"Dont go here\nWe decieded to go here for breakfast today and we left at about 11:30. When we got there They told us it would be 15 mins to get a tabel, we got one 30 mins later. We sat down at an area so loud You couldnt hear yourself think, And by the time we got our food it was like 1:30 ONE thirty!!!!\nThe food turned out to suck so i didnt eat and we ended up going to poppies bagels, a much better meal."
0,"Terrible. Came here because of all the reviews and had a terrible experience. I ordered the protein pancakes and their was no nuts in the pancake and it was just on top. They were dense and chewy, very unappetizing. My friend got the lemon poppy pancakes and their was no lemon flavor, just poppy seeds and the same dense texture. The lady kept asking if we had had enough to eat as if the portion was massive ( may I add that the portion was only big because of the dense cake). The waitress was clueless about the menu and and bussed our table and took 10 mins to take the check after, but gave us the check two minutes after we got our pancakes. This was a terrible experience, I would not recommend this place to anyone."
0,"Thoroughly disgusted by the unprofessional behavior I experienced at LAKA inside Fashion Show. I was there a couple days ago, waiting my turn (over an HOUR) to get a polish change (feet). I would've went to my regular nail salon but since they were closed and I was already inside Fashion Show, I decided to go here. BIG MISTAKE!! So when a \""manicurist\"" (from what I hear some of them aren't even licensed) asked me if I'd been helped I pointed to the black girl that I had spoke w/ earlier. She asked if I had an appt and I said no. She said they only go by appts. I WAS LIVID. The one thing you should never do is waste somebody's time. So I waited until the black girl was finished w/ what she was doing and demanded why she didn't tell me about the appt rule. She claimed she did, but what she did was ask me if I wanted to leave my phone # and they'd call me when a chair was free. Since I had nothing to do I told her I'd wait. NOT ONCE did she explain their \""protocol\"" about going off of appts so when I called her out on it she decided to get RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL and ARGUE w/ me... in front of her customers and all!! Unbelievable! And when I asked for the owner's information she refused to give it to me. Then I asked what her name was and she refused to give me that also... WHAT!?? I told her I would be notifying mall management and get her boss' info from them (which I did). \n\nOh and as a side observance (before all of the above happened) a customer came back because evidently she had her nails done earlier that day and the polish was already starting to chip off so she wanted it redone (I don't blame her either).\n\nBottom line, SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to a real nail salon! These people are NOT customer friendly and from what I saw their product isn't that great. So glad I didn't waste my $$"
1,"Overpriced for mediocre food. It's the novelty that you pay for.\nWe did the Four Course option, add lobster.\nNothing blew me away, except my company.  :)\nI'm glad I experienced it once, but probably won't go back for dinner. (Dessert, possibly.)"
3,"Love this place! Serves great breakfast, and fast friendly service!"
3,"The Cosmopolitan certainly is impressive: touchscreens at check-in and along the walls in the conference areas; beautiful pools; Sirius in your hotel room; and great views. \n\nIt is clearly aiming for the high-end/trendy crowd with flashy walls of video and animations and top-notch music in the elevator (LCD Soundsystem, Peter, Bjorn, and John, etc). \n\nThe rooms are clean and stylish - with a giant TV that controls the lighting and heating and ambiance in the room. The showers have a large window in them which overlook the sleeping/living area. \n\nThe room service was great - although I only ordered breakfast. They were honestly some of the best eggs I ever had. \n\nNow, for the bad -  the wake-up calls never worked - whether I set it through the TV or touch-screen phone. I nearly missed an important meeting my first day. Others in my group complained that their room wasn't serviced by 5pm, as well.\n\nIn my room - I did not have a dry cleaning slip to write-up and it took me two days longer than normal to get my dry cleaning handled because of that oversight. \n\nYou could do much worse with a hotel choice in Vegas and they still have time to get some of their problems fixed since they have only been open half-a-year at this point. I would stay here again - and will likely have to for work, anyway."
1,"I decided to eat at La Casa because of their Groupon and my love for tapas. The food is pricey, but in range for what a good tapas restaurant normally costs. However, their food was way below par and not worth the cost. \n\nThe highlight of the evening was the mussels dish in white wine sauce, which were flavorful and well-prepared. However, the experience quickly went downhill from there. The baked manchego tasted like frozen mozzarella sticks. The Moroccan spring rolls were bland and with a strange teriyaki dipping sauce. The crab cake with mango sauce was okay, but also not very flavorful. The patatas bravas tasted quite good, though they were not nearly as crispy as I normally like. The flavor made up for the mushy texture, but I think they mostly tasted that good in comparison to the rest of the food. In addition, their sangria was decent, but not great.\n\nThe ambiance was fantastic. The back porch area is lovely in nice weather. However, even with the groupon, this is not a place I would come back to."
0,Hamburgers that taste like spam....spam burgers ewwwww I don't know if they changed the meat or what but I will never get a burger from here again after that eeeesh
3,"This place is our \""go-to\"" take out place. It's right by our house and the delivery is fairly quick. They don't speak the best English, but with a little patience the communication is not too difficult. We order the chicken lettuce wraps, crab Rangoon, wonton soup, egg drop soup, chicken chow mien and the beef with broccoli. We haven't ever had a poor meal there, I am unsure what all the bad reviews are for, this place is a hole in the wall, not gourmet Asian cuisine. Service, food, and delivery speed are acceptable"
0,"How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it. \n\nTonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em. \n\n Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out. \n\nThey appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their \""premium\"" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out..\n\nAs usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food"
0,"Ace was nice and showed us some cars when I came n w my mom and my 6 year old daughter. But I told him I couldn't drive stick and the car he chose for me to test drive was a stick.  Not completely his fault but it took alot of time. Then he took my info to c if I could get financed and never came back and never called. My daughter got a few pieces of candy and the front desk lady was very rude. Don't remember her name but she yelled at my daughter and told her she couldn't answer the phone w her making noise. Seemed very put off. I asked her to have ace call me because my mom had to leave and I was going to pick up my car from the dealer and she was very rude. I won't go back. If not for how nice ace was, they would get a zero"
1,"Decent shopping plaza with mostly higher end shopping and dining. I've tried two restaurants here and been underwhelmed both times, and other than the Charming Charlies, the boutiques here are overpriced and very hit or miss.\n\nIt's an attractive shopping area, and parking garage lets you access the store via escalator, but there's nothing here to make me want to visit particularly often.\n\nCool design, trendy feel, but needs some better businesses to anchor it and bring in traffic."
1,"The bouncers/promoters were hollering to go inside as we walked by. I didn't know who they were talking to so I kept walking. My group of friends decided to go inside after all, so we walked in. When he checked my ID, he rudely said, \""you ignored me.\"" Oops, not my fault.\n\nInside, it was empty. No wonder they were luring people in. Overall, the atmosphere and the environment was just 'meh.'\n\nI would skip this place next time. One of the security people also asked us, \""why do you all look so sad?\"" We laughed and responded that we were at the river all day. Haha! Too much sun in one day will do that you us."
0,"Can't say the food is good or bad. The service was so terrible, I waited and didn't even get to eat. Gave up and went to another nearby establishment."
1,"Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.\n\nI ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms \""Tom Yum\"" and \""Som Tum\"" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.\n\nSoup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.\n\nThen the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.\n\nWater glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.\n\nWon't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!"
2,"It is a pretty casino. Visually interesting. The ceiling is low but is made up for by having the \""sky\"" right above you. \nthe little shops are fun and interesting and are a nice break to take while right on the casino floor."
1,"While the food was decent and my service was good (aside from waiting longer than expected for the check) I was really turned off by the conversation that came from the line cooks and the shift manager. We were seated near the kitchen and could hear them exchanging profanities (loudly) not just an f bomb here and there but every other word was \""F\"" \""C\"" \""B\"" and even talk of doing cocaine and sexual acts. The shift manager (a man in a black shirt) chose to use the area behind our table to argue with employees. We had our young daughter with us and could have sworn this was considered a family establishment. Not enjoyable...Will not be back..."
1,"I like the concept, and I think it's done decently, but I can't give above two stars because the bathrooms here were probably some of the filthiest I've seen in a movie theater. I mean, seriously, send someone in to check it out every now and then throughout the day. There was toilet paper all over the floor, and someone had spilled an entire salad on the floor in the first stall. I'll give it another shot, but that was a real turn-off. I really wanted to like this place, but I just think it needs some work. Hard not to compare it to iPic, which, while it is much more pricey, knows how to pull off the same concept."
1,"What can I say...... For this to be one of the best clubs in Vegas it didn't do much for me...... They were doing way too much when then made this one. The music was good but it was so crowded that you couldn't even dance. I'm short so it's not fun being mushed in a crowd of tall people trying to shake their butts. I didn't really drink much but I'm assuming their drinks were strong seeing that my home girl was tore up and she drinks like a man.... Well at least I can say been there done that, and don't plan on going back!"
3,"Lao Laan is like a high maintenance pretty girl that you wish you could say no to, but that has a way of opening up and emptying your wallet before you know what happened.....the entrees run about $10-$16, and the real problem is that the food is so good you'll want to get a soup (the kang gai especially) that you'll end up dropping $20+ per person per visit.  At least I always seemed to find a way to. \n\nIf you don't mind the price (or just can't help yourself) the food is always outstanding.  I also agree with other reviewers discussing the intimate nature of the restaurant, and it really does feel like your eating at someone's home.\n\nNow if only they wouldn't charge $6.25 for a bowl of soup....."
2,"Oh Yelpers, you've blown this place up in a way that's completely unwarranted. True, the patio is cute enough. Sure, the staff is friendly. Ok, the menu has quite a few tempting sounding options even though its a bit smaller than some other Thai menus. But was it a stellar, 5 star worthy dance on my palate? Nope. Sorry. \n\nOur party of four started with two vegetarian appetizers, the crispy spring rolls and the tempura vegetables. The vegetables were pretty good, lightly fried and crispy,but the spring rolls weren't very delicious. Heavy with a soggy cabbage center. I ordered the Pad Thai for my entree, as I figured that would be a good gauge of Pusadee's Garden's style. My food was forgettable. Not bad, just nothing special about it. Almost bland where I wanted an explosion of layers of flavor. Am I asking too much? I don't think so, because I've had such an experience at another Thai restaurant that I won't bother mentioning here because its not quite fair. There's no comparison! I also sampled my wife's fried rice dish, which to me wasn't worth the calories based on how non-exciting it was.\n\nIf I lived close by I'm sure I would occasionally order take out. It was perfectly good Thai cuisine. It just didn't excite me. Am I spoiled? Perhaps. A certain North Side establishment has apparently changed my expectations forever. I'm open to heading back and trying the Kao Soi, one of my favorite dishes. But as of now, Pusadee's Garden stands at a solid 3 stars."
3,"Like food from a truck, hate the lines, standing heat and lack of a place to sit, oh yeah and lack of beer? Well then come here as this solves all of those issues. The one issue it still does not solve is: is a hot dog and chips worth $8.50\n\nIn a hip urban down town spot which was the easily forgotten tedybertos is Short Leash sit and say, what happens when a food truck graduates to a food storefront.  There are a few bar seats, several 4 person tables and a larger table to accommodate small groups. \n\nThe menu consists of hotdogs with unique toppings server on naan bread, and some other items, and even a few dinner only items. There is beer and even a local little it shop to the side.\n\nI oped for a veggie dog in the seasonal style with a roasted pablano and pumpkin cream. I was skeptical but it worked well. I think the veggie dogs them selves could use a bit more character however.  The chips were home made and quite good, maybe the addition of a seasoned salt or aoli would be nice. \n\nIf you want to flex your hipster muscles and show off to a guest take them here, then cruize the hood on your fixie as there are a few other spots to grab a drink near by."
3,"Really tasty, but even more overpriced and nothing here is exquisite.  The space is nice and the service is good.  But $64 for 2 glasses of wine, a salad, a sandwich and 2 cups of coffee for lunch is a little ridiculous.  \n\nMy rule of thumb here is that I only go to Chelsea's Kitchen when it's not my money."
3,"Wow, some unbelievable combos of flavors done right. Lance, owner, very friendly is promoting his business in the right way.  After we got a half dozen he suggested a Nutty Pig and told us what was in it, who would have ever known reduced balsamic vinegar, nuts, dates, bacon, blue cheese, and cream cheese (think I got it right) would be so darn great! Lance knows his stuff and I'm hoping fellow Yelpers stop by this doughnut joint for some classic wonderful treats!  Suggestion, doughnut labels are hard to read."
3,"This tends to be one of my regular haunts. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have Chimay in stock which automatically gives them a few extra points in my book. Another great reason to drop by Shady's is that there's always a decent amount of people there any night of the week. In other words, you're not going to show up and look like the jackass who likes to down a tall one with the 60 plus date-rapist who doesn't know when to quit. \n\nThe thing that sets Shady's apart from other dive-esque lounges is the jukebox. It's nice to shoot a few games of pool while listening to a jukebox stocked by someone who has choice taste in music and doesn't crowd the machine with the standard Art Laboe \""Best of\"" mix.   So, go to Shady's, relax, get tipsy, shoot some pool, and chill out to Joy Division, Bowie, New Order, or whoever is playing on that beautiful machine."
4,"First time eating at Potliquor and I am definitely a fan... From the tasty Hummus dip & the mini beef bites was a great start.  Main course mini pulled pork sliders were on point.. Lots of flavor & very filling.  My husband had the chili brisket over cornbread   Was packed with great flavor. Ribs were very tasty,  moist and food came out at the same time for a large group...The ultimate favorite was the Mac n cheese by far the creamiest I wanted to eat it all but was stuffed from picking off everyone's plate. We couldn't pass up the dessert since the food was amazing the dessert has to be just as good...ordered a peanutbutter chocolate dessert that we all devoured. Excellent service, amazing food and comfortable atmosphere we will definitely be back!!!"
3,We always!! get a great meal and great service! Totally about customer service.
3,"Super good food!\nMy friends and I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, calamari, and fried catfish!\n\nWe ate it allllll up.\n\nMy only concern was that the crabs were a bit difficult to crack but then again I'm used to cracking the Alaskan crab legs.\n\nBut other than the difficult cracking, the mix of all the seasonings was just a great fusion of flavors to really individualize their seafood from anything I've ever tried.\n\nAnd it was not primetime when we went so service was pretty fast!\nHope they're on top of their game when it is busy!"
3,"Another addition to the rock pub contingent in Edinburgh, the Black Bull is small dingy and dirty. A perfect rock bar. The jukebox has got some rocking choons (sorry) and they are blared out over the whole bar. The inside is pretty small, with a few little nooks and crannies to hide in. The ceiling is really low, making it feel a bit cramped sometimes but generally it is ok. Before gigs at Studio 24 it's pretty rammed but everyone there is normally cool, and it's not an intimidating atmosphere.\n\nThe drinks are really cheap for he centre of town, and they have a different selection from the standard Tennents etc, leaning more towards American beers. The bar staff are all cool, and it's a good place for a different pub atmosphere than most in the centre of town."
3,In there today after an extended break.  Great sweet potato fries still.  Very attentive bar staff.  Big minus is no Wifi.
4,"I see Heather for the Brazilian Wax.  I have tried one other person and I have to say, Heather is really good! She is knowledgable, professional and takes a lot of pride in her work. Personally for me that means a lot and it keeps me coming back as a \""regular\"" customer!"
3,"Reminds me a little bit of Mel's Dinner from the old tv show \""Alice\"".  Kinda of small inside and had the sweaty kitchen staff in back. It has a '50's theme to it, which gave us plenty to look at while we waited for our meal.\n\nWe were seated right away and served drinks promptly as well. The waitress was very helpful in describing our meal choices and we never felt that we were an inconvenience to her.\n\nThe food came in very large quantities which was a pleasant surprise. Two burgers and fries was enough to fill up the two large individuals. Not the cheapest place to eat but when you consider portion size, it seems to be a fair deal.\n\nOverall a nice experience and will go again."
2,"Short and sweet. Great food but a bit high priced. The service wasn't bad, we went at the ultimate lunch hour with a full house so you're bound to fall into hold ups. The only unattractive thing about the locale really are the prices, I mean I understand the location is in Scottsdale, but c'mon now. It made me really appreciate my hole in the wall dive mexican food joints.\nI will say that I'm huge critic about hispanic restaurants salsa, and their hot is pretty damn good w/ fresh chips always."
2,"Average quality. Slow service,"
2,"If you want something fancy, book at the Westin. This is a perfectly adequate budget hotel that's located near everything in the downtown. That said, it's in a fairly sketchy part of town, so you may not want to bring your kids here. Decent for students, younger working folks or anyone who wants to save a bit. \n\nFYI, the continental breakfast doesn't include eggs - I saw plenty of people looking in a heating tray thinking there were eggs, only to look disappointed when they saw croissants and pastries. But that's no reason to skip the breakfast, which includes Cheerios and corn flakes, bagels, croissants, fruit and pastries, along with juices and coffee (it's not gourmet, but it's caffeine). \n\nAs I said, adequate... But I don't think I'd say here again."
4,Great home cooked meals.  Chicken sandwiches and Homemade Meatloaf are excellent!  Service was great also.  Would highly recommend!
4,"We have a new favorite Mexican restaurant... \n\nRancho De Tia Rosa was packed by 6:30 on Saturday night.  We called ahead (no reservations for groups less than 10) and had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated.\n\nThen came the red and green salsa with chips.  At first taste, after hearing all the yelp love for this stuff, I thought it was good but didn't see the hype.  Next thing I knew I had ordered a total of three extra salas.. both red and green.  This stuff is amazing!\n\nThe red salsa was fresh and not spicy at all, but was perfect for both dipping and topping off my beef carne asada fajitas. \n\nThe green salsa was sweet, but not too sweet and had an intoxication about it that made me continue to eat it long after I was full.\n\nWe tried the taco sampler (carnitas, beef, chicken).  All three were very good, but we were practically fighting over the carnitas and beef.  While the chicken was very good and clearly fresh, the carnitas and beef were too good to ignore.  Make sure you squeeze the lime on your carnitas.\n\nI had the beef carne asada (mexico city fajitas) w/ roasted vegetables, rice and beans.  Everything was perfectly cooked and had a delicate roasted taste to it that put each item over the top.  It seemed literally everything was freshly cooked over an open flame by someone who clearly took pride in what they were doing.\n\nThe way they slow cook the meat for 10 hours and then grill over an open flame combines for a taste sensation that can't be missed.  The meat is among the most tender and was probably of a good cut.  You wouldn't know because it was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth.\n\nMy wife had the beef chimichanga which also was delicious.  The chimi was perfectly cooked fresh and not greasy.\n\nWe finished our meal off with the fried ice cream with strawberries.  This is a must try!  All the ingredients perfectly meshed together and the strawberries put it over the top.\n\nOnly negative of the night was our 'chips and salsa boy', who we coined \""Slammy Sosa\"" because he angrily slammed down our salsas.\n\nWe think it was because he forgot to bring them a few minutes earlier.  This kid seemed to hate his life and became clearly disgusted when I asked for a green salsa (he only brought the red, come on dude!!).  We laughed about his nickname for the duration of the meal, so it wasn't a big deal.... but he almost cost this place a star.\n\nOh and I would definitely recommend this place for kids.  It was very loud because it was packed, so you don't have to worry about that.  Also they had the BEST balloon artist we'd ever seen.  He was very loud and funny.  The kids loved him.  He made some of the most amazing things from balloons, including a basketball hoop hat"
1,"We are always excited at the prospect of eating at Liberty, but the last few times have been disappointing. This time was no exception and it will be our last visit. From the apathetic servers to the bar that doesn't know how to make basic  mixed drinks and the inconsistent results on food, it's just not up to par. Our calamari fries were good tonight but our \""adult\"" grilled cheese had unmelted slices of cheese and missing cheeses and ingredients promised by our server. It's a shame that a great looking place with some talent in the kitchen can't pull it all together better than this."
1,"I am a steak lover but I must say this wouldn't be somewhere i would recommend. Our steaks were cooked wrong, had a pretty blah taste and we sat in the restaurant for 20 min before anyone asked us about drinks. The drinks were $9 and were supposed to be \""top shelf\"" uh I thinks not. tasted very watered down and I decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio. The only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us. Listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining....... I would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied"
1,"At first, it's hard to say why Geisha House is empty at dinner time during happy hour. It's a beautiful interior but then you'll say to yourself \""you know, it must be the location.\"" Nobody would blame you. Everything in this center is dead with the exception of LVAC. Order some food, though, and you'll realize there is another reason it's empty: the food is beautiful yet deeply unsatisfying. \n\nThe spicy salmon roll wasn't spicy, and was a little skimpy on the fish. The \""traffic light\"" roll was missing raw fish altogether. I want to say a whole 4 thin slices were present. The tonkotsu ramen was hilariously light and unramen-like - no rich and fatty broth coupled with a nice cut of pork. Just tired, thin pork with a watery flavorless broth holding a fully cooked egg. Oh and 10lbs of noodles (I'm exaggerating).\n\nHere's something weird: no sushi menu!\n\nYou see, there could be something to this emptiness. Which reminds me - they ran a few \""naked sushi\"" events years ago. I remember them also being underwhelming. Essentially a buffet of bar food and basic rolls. Totally pointless. \n\nTake your time and money elsewhere. If they put as much effort into their food as they did their staffing and presentation, this would be 5 stars"
0,Had the tinga chicken and it tasted pretty bad and slimy. Prices are way too high for the quality
3,"I'm a bit surprised the reviews are this low for the Buffet at Monte Carlo.  \n\nWe went for brunch on a Friday, and were pleasantly surprised with the taste, variety, and decor.\n\nWe walked in, and it was not that busy at about 12:30, which honestly was a bit concerning.  At this buffet, you do get your own drinks, only the plates are cleared by the attendants.  M Life Members get $3.00 off the price of the buffet.\n\nThey were changing a lot of dishes during our visit, and we were very happy with the variety.  Everything we had tasted delicious, was well stocked, warm, appealing to the eye, a wonderful variety.\n\nWe truly had no complaints.  We also went to two other buffets during this trip and one of them was horrible, so we do know how to judge food.  \n\nAlso, as compared to many buffets, the decor was bright, the dining room was clean, and there was plenty of space in this buffet."
3,Awesome Red curry ... I loved it and it was spicy too. Came with white rice. I tried their mushroom soup it was loaded with mushrooms and extremely spicy but good. Can't wait to try more
2,"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip.  The tripadvisor reviews were good and the rooms looked pretty nice online.  I got a queen size bed room that was decently sized.  The bathroom was fairly large with a shower over tub for 89 pounds a night.  \n\nThe good:\n- The location of the hotel was excellent, it was in the city centre at the west end of george st, rose st., and princes st. (nice street in the New side of Edinburgh)\n- they have a bowl of fresh fruit in the lobby that you can just go in and get fruit every day\n- they also have a pretty nice bar downstairs\n\nThe bad:\n- They seem somewhat short on staff, and it takes a while to get a hold of the reception.  However, when you do get a hold of the reception, they are very helpful.\n- They do not have any kleenex/tissue in the room\n- The bed was somewhat uncomfortable\n- There was no clock in the room\n\nOverall, I'd say the experience was okay at the Hudson."
4,"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've \""cheated\"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. \n\nTheir massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. \n\nI typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment."
1,"My family and I stayed in Vegas one night and wanted some Chinese, so our condo manager recommended China Joy.  We should have taken one look at the place and run away, but alas, we were blinded by hunger. \n\nUpon opening our take-out box containing the egg foo yung, my mom remarked:  \""well.... that looks..... authentic?\""  My grandma thought the foo yung looked like a huge fuzzy tarantula, and that's not far off.  The taste was okay, if you could get past the huge parts that were blackened and the other parts that were basically pure solidified grease. \n\nThe pad Thai was the best thing we tried, and it didn't taste like \""real\"" pad Thai at all.  Very tomato-ey, kind of spicy, but decent enough.  The fried rice was too sweet and the lo mein was pretty forgettable.  \n\nBasically if you need your monthly serving of grease and oil, you should consider China Joy.  Otherwise, save yourself a cardiac arrest and go somewhere less ...Joy-like.."
3,"I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, but had not previously had the pleasure. I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.\n\nWhen the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of \""sandwich\"", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of \""Sandwiches\"" and the brisket sandwich being called \""Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket\"", I foolishly assumed the other items not named \""Open Faced\"" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty. \n\nAlthough I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations. \n\nThe dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two."
0,"My rating really borders more than 1 star, but not really equaling 2.\n\nI've been to the Planet Hollywood on numerous occasions for work.  I didn't really have a choice in hotel as we were obligated to stay here.  If I had my choice, I definitely would not have returned after the first couple of times (I like to give my places a chance).\n\nIn general, the price does not equal the amenities.  Everyone knows that the PH used to be the Aladdin hotel by now, but that was eons ago...and their purple towels prove it.  Not only did it NOT go with the decor, but the towels are so far faded...it really grosses me out.\n\nThe views suck, from a majority of the hotel rooms and the heat/air conditioner has a mind of its own.  The complimentary shampoo, conditioner, etc. are not worth the freeness, so bring your own stuff.\n\nThe 24 hour cafe is quite mediocre and in terms of food, the only other saving grace is that there is a Starbucks on the casino floor as well as easy access to the Millennium restaurants and shops.\n\nAside from that, I stand by my ground that the price of the hotel does not match what it has to offer anyone who stays there."
0,"I had gone to Eagles crest for lunch a few times and decided to take my family, from out of town, one weekend. When we arrived, there was a sign on the front door saying that it was customer appreciation day. We Bought a round of drinks and found a table to sit at. Other patrons were going through the food line which was set up at the pool table.  But my sister-in-law went To get a veggie plate, One of the female staff came from around the bar and slapped the plate out of her hand And told us that we were not welcome there. We finished our drinks and left. As we were leaving we checked the sign on door again to see if it was marked private party, but it was not. After that experience I will never go back to Eagles Crest."
1,"OK, so I've upgraded this experience to 2 stars, but it still probably only deserves a 1.5, which is better than last time. \n\nThe burger was actually pretty good this time, and the wait wasn't that bad. Again, this is not a great burger by any means and on any given day you could experience a whopper junior that has more flavor.\n\nWhen the girl asked if I wanted fries, I responded \"" Are they still the same thin, soggy, greasy, flavorless, nothing fries or have you changed your recipe to make decent fries? She just smiled and said they were the same, so I said, \""no thanks\"".\n\nIn and Out is obviously a Southwest thing. Anyone who is from the Midwest or East Coast expects restaurants to rise above mediocrity, but mediocrity, unfortunately, is what passes for \""great food\"" in Arizona."
2,"Switch is a great place for sandwiches for lunch or a late night meal.  Lots of space and a cute atmosphere with a small patio for fall and winter.  Although it overlooks a parking lot, the cushy blue furniture still makes the atmosphere appealing.  \n\nStart with the onion rings - they're crisp, crunchy, thick, and delicious.  Sandwiches There's a wide variety of sandwiches, many of which are quite good and feature ingredients like soft pretzel buns, housemade pickles, and grilled ciabatta.  Skip the lobster roll and go for one of the pitas or, if you're in the mood for something hearty and a little sweet, try the Southern Dump Truck.  Although the chicken batter won't be as crispy as you might like and will slide off of the thigh meat, the meat itself will be moist and flavorful.  Maple tabasco mayo and vidalia onion jam give it a real touch of sweetness to balance it against the tartness of housemade pickles, all sandwiched inside a pretzel bun with bacon and fried onion strings.  I wouldn't recommend it for a weekday lunch unless your job is compatible with post-lunch food comas!"
1,"Facts: I recently moved to Charlotte. I've been spending a lot of time in Starbucks lately for the free wi-fi and free refills that come with my gold card. This was probably my least favorite Starbucks I've stopped at. I didn't have too much trouble finding parking or a table, but the interior wasn't as inviting as other locations. I also hate it when I get a beverage and it's short on milk... I don't like paying $4 for a half full drink! The baristas here were also the least friendliest I've encountered."
3,"I loved the decor and the whole layout of this hotel.  Rooms are on par with the best on the strip which is expected for this high end stay.  Great service and if you ever get to use the VIP service, do enjoy."
2,"NoFo on Liz used to be my all-time favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Come on, it had a cute gift shop attached- what's not to love for a girl?\n\nI was very excited to see that Smalls had begun to fill that space vacated by NoFo and Mexi Cafe and on such a great street that has gems like Customshop and Elizabeth Creamery.\n\nI hit the jack pot ordering. Holy chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and the syrup was just sweet enough without being over-powering. My friends kept eating off my plate. This is a must have item. \n\nMy friends however where not blown away. Hence- the reason for a three star review. We enjoyed the fried pickles but the sliders were dubbed \""eh\"" and not even finished- rare for this group. The flatbread was not anything special. I adore how the beer and wine are all local and all the food is made to order. But- order the signature items if you want to be blown away-  since the portions are not huge ordering here can get expensive quick. I can't wait to come back for a second try!"
3,"Furusato is simple, well-done, authentic Japanese food (which is what my Japanese language school told me as well about this place). Don't expect any fancy presentation \u00e0 la \""Jun I\"" or other high end Japanese restaurants, but expect quality ingredients full of flavor, prepared expertly. The beef teriyaki, as pedestrian as it sounds, is superb - just the right balance between sweet and savory, full of beefy goodness, and perfectly cooked - Japanese comfort food really, and the teriyaki sauce is definitely not from a jar. The Japanese salad with seaweed and octopus is a great small dish to start with, and the Yuzu mixed with rice vinegar and soy sauce was a fantastic dressing I was even tempted to drink (thank god I had plenty of sake instead). The Yellowfin collar was perfectly cooked and something you won't find elsewhere. We also had eggplant in a nice tangy broth, and an array of some of the best sushi I've had in Montreal, included the tuna hand roll, and the melt in your mouth unagi and ikura. The service is efficient and very friendly, and this more than makes up for the slightly depressing, dilapidated interior. They should move the dish washing station away from the sushi bar, move the fridge to the kitchen, and have the sushi bar be more of a centerpiece. Still, other than Kazu (which reigns supreme), this is the best place for authentic Japanese I've found in Montreal. Itadakimasu - bon appetit!"
0,They have a large selection of products. There pricing is higher then universal police supply. There customer service I feel is not very good at all.\n\nI have spent a lot of money at this location and I feel they still don't know who I am. I ordered a vest and when I ordered it I was told it would take 4-6 weeks I got it 3 months later and I had to call. \n\nI would not recommend.
2,"To follow up on our recent experience at Black and Bleu, I need to state that Jen K., one of the owners of this restaurant has reached out to correct this situation that was created by Ami, who is no longer with Black and Bleu. \nShe has been very proffesional and kind to attempt to repair the ill feelings we had towards the restaurant, due to the treatment we received from their former manager. For this I am grateful! Thank you Jen, you have restored my faith that your establishment does care how their customers are treated.\n( I needed to add stars as it wouldn't post w/o that, so chose 3 for no particular reason)"
3,This is a really nice and sunny wee place that is great for early breakfasts and masters of the sandwiches. There is a nice window long table that is just perfect to sit and sip on a coffee or lunch and watch the world pass outside whilst the sun is shining through the window south born. \n\nI had their club sandwich that was just what I wanted after going swimming. The best thing is that tasty food and cheap goes very well hand in hand.
4,"I'm a NYC girl and you know we need a good pizza when we are craving food from \"" home\"". Do not miss out on the AMAZING pizza from Above The Crust. We go almost EVERY Tuesday for the buy one get one free special. Throw in a couple of cannolis (made to order) and you have a meal fit for a NEW YORK KING !!!! Highly highly HIGHLY recommend !!!! Love you guys !!!!"
4,Love this shopping center and feel lucky to have it be so close to home. The selection of restaurants at all price levels is great! The shops have a nice variety. Movie theater is large and always playing something! Some of the stores have closed down but overall a perfect outdoor shopping center!
3,"Did the tasting menu which was actually very good at a reasonable price.  Decided to try the wine pairing with it which was not nearly as good.  As many others have listed here, the Siberian Nachos and the Roquefort Filet are amazing.  The service was fantastic as well and I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the weak wine pairing."
2,"I actually worked concessions here with a friend of mine for Summer Jam, which is Power 98's festival held once a year.  We had a great time joshing around with our customers and talking with the other concession people.  I made a friend with a brother who was hustling glow sticks and mouthpieces.  We joked about all of the thugs and hoochies suited up in the fliest streetwear.  \n\nA young girl of about twelve tried to hustle some ice cream off of me, claiming that her's fell.  She asked if she could bring her cup back and get some for free.  I said sure, but we didn't even sell them in cups.  We laughed and I convinced her to just buy one.  \n\nWe shut down our stand at around ten o' clock so we could catch the Three Six Mafia show (which was disappointing-just a bunch of yelling).  The arena is set up nicely and the sound acoustics are good, but I prefer smaller venues.  However, you can easily view the stage from wherever you are seating.  I know this, because I surveyed the place for a good spot and they were all about the same.  I would recommend this place for headliner acts or a sports event."
0,"I go to the movies an average of 5 times per week (yes, you read that correctly) but this theater makes my blood boil. I only go here to see a movie as a last resort. I don't know if it's because of the location and all those Summerlin elitists think they are more important than the rest of us, but this theater has the worst problem with talking and audience behavior than anywhere else I have ever seen a movie. Is everybody at Red Rock drinking rude juice? \n\nI have never seen a film here where the audience didn't yap the entire way through it -- and I have even been in the theater when there were only 2 other people in there and damn if they didn't talk the whole time too! I've reported this to the manager SEVERAL times. The response I always get is the same: \""I understand.\"" That's it! Well if you UNDERSTAND, then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Kick the people out! Help save our sanity! No, I don't want a refund or a free ticket, I want to be able to see a movie IN PEACE AND QUIET with an audience that isn't full of rude, crude and socially unacceptable people!!!!!!!!\n\nI've politely voiced my concern with three different managers at the theater, over a dozen employees, and even with Regal Cinemas corporate headquarters. I've had the manager personally call me on the phone twice. That's nice, but still nothing has been done to address the behavior. It is rampant at this theater and it is the worst. \n\nI've had people carry on full-volume conversations, answer their cell phones, make phone calls, repeat nearly every line in the movie, refuse to take their screaming infants out to the lobby, and have their 2 year old toddlers RUN AROUND and hit the back of seats during an R-rated movie. Yep, twice! I have gotten up during the movie, left the auditorium and gone out to alert an employee. Why should I have to be punished and made to leave the film to go get somebody to help enforce audience behavior? Each time the employees haven't given a crap about it. On that note, why the hell are small children even ALLOWED in an R-rated movie, EVER?!? What's next, little Billy gets his eyes full at \""Blue Is The Warmest Color?\""\n\nI refuse to go here ever again. This last time was the last straw. My blood pressure just went up 30 points from writing this review because it makes me so angry to think about this theater. AVOID at all costs."
0,"Placed a rather simple pick up order-small pepperoni pizza.  I was not told a price on the phone, I figured it would be in the 10 dollar range.  Lesson learned, never assume anything!  When i got there, I paid over 15$, which, I'm sorry is EXCESSIVE!   They need to sprinkle gold or something on there to make it worth the money at that price.  Either way, I paid since I did order it and figured if it was a really good pizza it was worth it.  Needless to say I was further disappointed when I got home and started eating it-now, I don't have extremely high standards when it comes to pizza-I love dominos, pizza hut, you name it-but the sauce was bland and had no taste to it. I lived in Boston for many years and have visited NYC many times; believe me when I tell you, this place has nothing, and I mean NOTHING in common with NY pizza.  I was disappointed and won't be back."
3,"One of the best buffet ..I could end the sentence with I ever had, or in Vegas or...\nI liked almost everything. I liked prosiutto, red olives, salami, oatmeal, pork bun, cheviches, even sushis were good. \nI paid over $30 person, that's quite expensive but it was well spent.\nBy the way coffee was ok."
0,"Went here once for lunch at the suggestion of a friend from work.  he is no longer my friend.  I've got nothing, it was awful, just awful.  I love the fact that you also get hosed a nice \""fee\"" for using your debit card for any purchase.  Great way to keep them coming back, nickel and dime the piss out of your customers.  The drink refill policy there is a joke.  \n\nI'd like to give them an \""A\"" for effort, but they lost me with the craptastic debit card fee and communist-style drink refill pricing, they will receive an overwhelming \""F\"" rating from me.  Change that and I might give ya another shot there, Stalin."
0,"My parents were in town and rented a car with a local Enterprise while visiting me.  They made a week-long reservation and to be picked up at 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday, so we called and verified the pickup time.  They said they would be there between 9:30-10 am .... 10:30 am rolls around and my mom finally called them, to which they replied that the van had been outside for 45 minutes waiting for them to come outside.  This is ridiculous because we had all been looking outside every 10 minutes between 9:30 - 10:30 to make sure they didn't miss them.  They said they were calling my mom's cell phone, which unfortunately our house is like the Bermuda Triangle of cell phone reception; however, there were no missed calls showing and no messages.  We have an outside entrance and they knew our unit number and never knocked on the door or rang the doorbell.  The \""great\"" CSRs (I don't want to even spell out the acronym because customer service it was NOT) then proceeded to tell my mom that if she wanted to rent from them, she had to find a ride or take a taxi.  Screw that! We decided to rent from Hertz."
2,"Well I went in here yesterday, it was close to my work so i figured why not? The food was delicious, hot and fresh BUT it took fooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrr to get my food i had an hour lunch and i didnt even get to finish eating... wont be going back there again at lunch time!"
1,"The newest addition to the Las Vegas strip, The Linq, provides a handful of new restaurants for us locals to try. Flour and barley was at the top of my list for wanting to try. Sadly, I was disappointed by both service and food. \n\nService was almost non existent. I understand it's a new restaurant, and most employees are new, and it takes a little time to get in the groove of things. However, the service was too bad to be able to overlook. Our server did not seem to know much about the menu. When asked what their recommendations were, she couldn't even answer because she hadn't had most of the food items. Service was also quite slow on the drink refills. \n\nAs for the food, we started with the baked clams as well as the mozzarella en carozza (Italian bread filled stuff mozzarella, prosciutto, and basil). They were ok. The mozzarella en carozza was basically just a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. The bread had a nice golden brown toast to it and was quite crunchy. However, the inside of the sandwhich left more to be desired. A thick slice of cold mozzarella and a very thin piece of prosciutto did not cut it. The baked clams were decent enough, just a little heavy on the salt. \n\nFor our pizzas, we ordered the Carbonara (pancetta, roasted cauliflower, farm egg) as well as the Calabrese ( meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto).  The Calabrese was decent enough. The tomato sauce had good flavor and it had a good amount of toppings. It ess basically their version of an escalated meat lovers pizza. The chili verde that also comes on it was a nice addition. As for the Carbonara, well, that was the low point in the meal. I was quite excited for this one, as it sounds amazing, and I'm sure it would've been. But upon receiving our pizza, it was room temperature at best, as if it had just sat out while our other pizza was being cooked. The crust was no longer crisp, just soggy. Super disappointing. Would've sent it back, but l again, service was bad and we could find out server. My party and I all tried to eat a slice, but we left half the pizza untouched. And as much as some of you like to eat cold pizza, it's definitely not what I expect to eat when I'm paying to eat hot pizza in a restaurant. \n\nOverall, would I go back? Probably not, which is a shame. I can already forsee spending many nights at The Linq, showing around my tourists friends or bar hopping with my fellow locals, but I don't think Flour and Barley will ever be a stop on the list."
0,"I'm super disappointed with their take-out. I eat here probably two or three times  a month, but never ordered take-out, the portion was ridiculously small. I just spent 50 bucks on a meal that I ended up eating chips and dip afterward to get full. I would probably actually go there or just get apps!! I hate when you order take out and they chince it up, wth"
2,"The Vegas 'street meat' scene has really taken off as of late, I've heard plenty buzz around the Fukuburger truck, Slidin' Thru... but how good can a burger be that is made in a dirty-ish, probably re-commissioned vehicle? In this case, actually not too bad.\n\nTo start off I must be fair, the Vegas truck scene isn't just about burgers, there are grilled cheese trucks, buns, and even clothing. Of course my main thing is burgers, so that's pretty much all I care about at this point. This whole food truck scene is a bit pretentious for me, I don't appreciate having to get to one of their locations early, only to stand in line and fight to hopefully get a burger before they sell out. If I have to work too hard for my burger, then you're never going to get me to eat one. Oh and let's not forget that almost every food truck scene I've been around in Vegas has been attended primarily by our entire high school population. I tried one time to actually be at Fuku's scheduled locations, and by the time I got there they were sold out as predicted. This is the reason it's been almost a year since that time, and the only reason I ate one last week is because I happened to be on Fremont St right where they were. And good luck trying to find where they will be, if you can navigate their fairly awful, Myspace-like website, their schedule isn't always up to date so finding where they will be tonight may not always be possible unless you are also following them on Twitter or some other social media site.\n\nAs for the d\u00e9cor, in this case we can only really mention the truck itself as they don't have a fixed location at this point. The truck is fairly clean looking, aside from the loads of stickers, and slight grime on the shelves which you can maybe see in the background of the burger closeups. There is a hot girl taking your orders in the midst of slight madness. There seems to be some planned method for order placement and pickup, but the drunks on Fremont don't quite allow this to flow smoothly, neither do the homeless that are assaulting you for an add to your order for them. Also, the megaphone that's used to call out your name could probably stand for a replacement as whatever they are saying is hardly intelligible, and a decorative ring around the front edge fell off while I was there. Still, this is all part of the overall feel of getting food off of a food truck, so the overall mystique and character are quite fun. Plus I happened to catch this on Fremont st, which is my favorite place in Vegas.\n\nThe burger itself was surprisingly good. Although it looked nothing like the picture on the menu, it had great flavor and was quite fresh. The meat didn't have amazing flavor on its own, but wasn't bad by any means and still better than some sit down restaurants I've been to lately. The bun was grilled as well, had decent flavor, and was proportioned well, all considering it's of the more 'typical' variety. The lettuce was, well, lettuce. The Fuku sauce was lacking a little flavor, but maybe there just wasn't enough. The bacon was pretty tasty, although maybe a bit soggy on mine. The American cheese was ok, but most importantly melted, which is something that many restaurants can't seem to do somehow. Overall this is a good burger, similar to a Bachi burger in its Asian theme, although this doesn't quite come close to that freshness and overall tastiness.\n\nThe fries are nothing to write home about, I think I got them garlic seasoned or something, but they just seemed to be out of a frozen packet sprinkled with some garlic seasoning. I don't know if I would expect them to have a full setup to make amazing fries on this truck though, for their focus and main attention should be the burgers. I'll leave that up to the fry truck whenever someone unveils it.\n\nOverall, this burger is good, and you could do a lot worse in town. The scene isn't for everyone though, many people would prefer to sit down in a clean restaurant and get their food without having to fight for it. But if you're into the 'cultural' scene of Vegas, enjoy eating your meat on a sidewalk surrounded by drunken hipsters in 100 degree weather, then definitely get your Fuku on. Just make sure you get there early or you'll be let down."
4,"This is as good as cheese gets in Montreal. Cheaper than Val-Mont next door, which competes for fancy cheeses."
1,"I read a bunch of these reviews prior to going here and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the green curry. I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted it, so I had to tell him. No biggie. He dropped our food off and didn't come back for quite some time. I had to do the ole \""wave your hand in the air\"" to get his attention (something I'm normally opposed to doing). The curry was awfully bland, almost like they it dumbed it down for the South Side crowd. I asked for more curry powder, but he told me they only use curry paste and walked away. I suppose that was his way of saying I don't get any...\nI guess what i'm trying to say is that this place would be good for a person that doesn't like Thai food. Nothing too authentic, flavorful."
1,"This past July, my friend and I randomly hit this sushi spot because we were craving sushi.  After just landing in Vegas and have some drinks in our room at Bally's, we were ready to just get some food in our bellies.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nicely decorated.  Modern seating, contemporary colors, an aquarium and contemporary music (mainly Pop, if i'm not mistaken) completed the atmosphere.  We had the Ninja Roll and the Las Vegas Roll.  Quite frankly, they were both OK. Nothing stand-out about it, but nothing gross.\n\nNothing special but nothing to write off."
2,"I have been trying to find a good Chinese place ever since I moved here from AZ and this is the first restaurant (along with SOHO) that has been like- able. Food seemed somewhat fresh, quality was okay, not too greasy. Lacking in flavor, I got the sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice and spring roll."
2,"Great food, but this location is always busy so it's not a good place to go if you don't have a couple hours to eat your meal. If they are busy, it could be difficult if you need extra accomodations. Not that they aren't willing to help, just a lack of space."
3,"First time trying Brio was at Tivoli Village during happy hour. It was nice sitting outside until sunset cuz I felt like I roasted out in the sunlight. Aside from the tanning, the happy hour specials are f*ing great. There's a wide variety of $3 appetizers & discounted martinis to choose from & it turns out that my favorites were the margherita flatbread & lemontinis."
1,"Laaaame.\n\nI went here to get some shorts and parts for my bike during the NC tax holiday.  After I left, I discovered that they had charged me tax on the clothing items even after I specifically raised that issue and they told me they were not going to charge tax.\n\nAlso, they insisted on charging me for a couple cable caps despite the fact that I was buying a bunch of brake and derailleur cables (and a lot of other stuff).  Any decent shop would have handed me a few caps on the house, because they're cheap as toothpicks and hey, it's great customer service to be friendly.  But not Performance. \n\nGo to your local bike shop for better service."
3,"#148\n\nAlthough the Muse concert (04.10.10) was at Mandalay Bay, we decided to stay at The Mirage. One of the great things about The Mirage is its central location on the LV strip. It really is within walking distance of where most folks want to go.\n\nAs the room was under my friend's name, she had to check in. Unfortunately, the $20 trick didn't work. We were told that it was a busy weekend so they weren't able to offer any upgrades. I think it's because we checked in on the later side on Saturday. It was almost 5:00pm so they may have given out everything. We probably would have had better luck if it was a Friday - who knows. I do not recall the exact room rate, but I believe it was quite competitive given that we booked the room only days before.\n\nFor a relatively older hotel, I was impressed at how nice the standard deluxe rooms were - quite spacious and modern with two queen beds and a 40\"" or 42\"" wall mounted LCD TV. There are several ports (USB, HDMI. S-Video, etc.) near the desk if you want to connect something to the TV. On the dresser between the beds there is also an iPod alarm clock. The bathroom is a bit on the small side and I didn't find the water pressure in the shower to be great. That said, it was manageable.\n\n\""Free\"" wifi is available, in the rooms at least - you just need to enter the last name of the reservation and the room number. I tested it to about 3mbps download - not terrible. You really are paying for it in a room fee, but you also get two bottles of water each day.\n\nThe only negative was that a hotel worker came around knocking on doors at 9am on a Sunday for \""room checks\"". I'm still not exactly sure what that was all about, but it woke us up. Maybe it's our fault for not putting up the DND sign.\n\nOverall, The Mirage rooms exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely stay here again - hopefully with $20 trick success."
3,"Although this location is smaller than others, it does have a great laidback atmosphere.   The front desk staff is friendly and make every effort to make me feel like a valued member.\n\nWith that said, it would be great if they would open a location in the north valley (Norterra area)."
2,"Wasn't bad at all, in fact i do plan on returning. The calamari was a little bit different than what I'm used too, 4 long strips versus the pile of tempura style rings others serve. The mussels were different also, as they don't serve them in the shells in, which is cool but different. The rolls were fresh & the staff was friendly. Extra friendly, helpful & responsive. Each sushi spot is unique in it's own way and none of them are the same."
3,"The food here was very good.  They also have an excellent tequila menu.\n\nThe service was a little grumpy but I found that in almost all of the restaurants in Scottsdale, must be a Scottsdale thing."
2,"My boyfriend and I went last night. We each got an entree and a drink and split the apple pie moonshine. We sat on the patio which was really nice, really cute decorations. The service was great. Our server was always there when we wanted but wasn't always interrupting us. The moonshine was really good, super smooth with no bite at all. (We couldn't decide whether that was a positive or negative.) The food was okay. I got the pulled pork and it was pretty dry. I had to ask for extra BBQ sauce. The coleslaw was terrible. I don't think it had any sauce on it at all. My boyfriends chicken was pretty good, but really small and didn't have much meat on it. Overall a decent experience. I would go back, but not to eat."
0,Mediocre at best.  Fitness center is A+++. Otherwise rooms are a C- and service is a clear fail.
3,"I got kinda hooked on this location for two reasons: 1) their only a block away from my house and often on my way in and out, and 2) during last summer and their promotion of $0.50 ice cream, I became a fan.  The staff is helpful, and I've seen them go out of their way to provide excellence in customer care.  The food that I have tried has always been piping hot or in the case of ice creams and shakes, delightful.  It is a rather new location, only a few years old and well maintained and very inviting environment to sit and indulge..."
0,We were in the mall with young grandkids one afternoon.  The restrooms were absolutely filthy.  The children's play area was getting its daily cleaning (why is this done at a time when kids could be playing and not before/after mall hours).  No wonder the place is deserted and unshopped.  There is nothing appealing about coming here anymore.
2,We only came here to grab a pair of shades at the Oakley store.  It is basically a million degrees and you run from store to store to get onto the ac.  I feel super bad for the people working the kiosks outside.  HOT!
1,"Where do I start! I travel 3 weeks a month for work and was staying at the plaza before taking a shot at the Grand. They comped me 2 of 3 nights because I gamble. Donated over a grand on this trip. My wife and daughter came and it was a mess from check in to check out. Girl at check in had me write the names of my family on a piece of paper so that she spelled them correctly. Shower is just plain stupid as you read in other reviews. Soak a towel on the floor for every one that showers. Pool is great, EXCEPT, they do not comp cabanas. Not one was being used and they only have 3 umbrellas for the whole place. If you want a cabana, you have to commit to $150 in food and beverage. Then, it is COMPLIMENTRY. A margarita is $14. Next morning, wife and daughter went down to caf\u00e9 for breakfast. Tables were open, but they had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Took ANOTHER 30 minutes to get their food! Food was not good either! NO in room coffee, iron or board, as all 3 star hotels do. Free coffee downstairs in Art Bar. Good location as I am done staying on the strip. Gonna try another hotel down on Fremont next time. Can't even get an email on their website to complain. Guess I have to go old school and call. Principal to me..."
3,"as a short little birthday treat for my butterfly obsessed lady, we went on a little tour of this relatively new item in scottsdale. \n\ni found it strange when they were building it, out in the desert, in a non-descript parcel of land off the 101, why anyone would build a butterfly sanctuary in arizona, land of 120 degree summer temps?\n\nwell they did, and it was only a matter of time before we would go. \n\nwe bought tix online and good thing we did because the ticket lines were super long. we were able to get in quickly, get our stamp and wait for about 5 minutes for the \""flight of the monarch\"" 3-D movie. it's a neat little show about the monarchs, but we had more than a few screaming kids in the audience for the 15 minute show. \n\non to the chrysalis, or butterfly nursery exhibit. that was really neat to see real live butterfly's being \""born\"". there is an ant, bee, small aquarium exhibit, and desert insect exhibit, but the real fun starts in the butterfly exhibit. \n\ntip: wear bright clothes and you're likely to get a few of these delicately beautiful insects to land on you!\n\nthere were hundreds of absolutely magical butterfly's floating around. their colors and the closeness as to which you could approach them was truly amazing. they are bugs and only live 2 weeks, but it's still very neat to see them up close and be awed how pretty they are. \n\nweekends are probably packed, but on this sunday around 11am, it wasn't too bad. all the staff were super friendly and the price is decent for an hour or 2!"
0,"Wish I had something good to say about the food, but we never actually had the opportunity to eat. Ten minutes of fire alarms and flashing lights in the middle of dinner service kind of killed it for our party. We just couldn't take it any longer."
1,"Yeah, I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers here that the lines of communication and general attitude here are pretty awful. I read on some other site about someone experiencing bait-and-switch style tactics here, which I felt these guys tried to do, though I held their feet to the fire and went to their top financing guy, and he worked with me and was very nice, and I ended up getting a better deal, which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one. \n\nOne question, Chapman sales staff (and mgmt.): Why hurry to \""close deals\"" (in the guise of a peppy \""We really want to get this deal done for you and get you out the door in your brand new car!\"") and promise a deal that you can't backup until you get the final word from the bank??? Stop giving people the erroneous idea that it's a done deal when you drive away. My experience was, a few days after the sale, I get the \""It's gonna be another $2,000 down and blah blah blah at this rate for you to keep this car...\"" etc. And when I protested nicely, saying, \""Can you work with me here?\"" the salesman walks me to the back lot and shows me a completely different car make and goes, \""You can buy this one with your credit (not having any credit cards or open lines of credit in the last 2 years constitutes \""bad credit\"")...or I can give you your old car back and we can say goodnight\"" kind of rudely, and I was left flabbergasted that he didn't get the facts squared away from the bank before letting me fall in love with the VW Jetta he hurredly put me in (Yes, he picked the right car for me, it is awesome, but still...). Just be honest with people and say, \""we need to hear back from the bank till it's a done deal\"". People appreciate honesty and won't necessarily run away if you are, but unfortunately most understand deception is part of the car salesman game.  \n\nAnd yeah, the VW service dept. people are incredibly condescending. I even got called \""buddy\"" which is plain insulting in that situation. It's \""Sir,\"" guys. Wake up and learn some customer service skills, K?\n\nI'm afraid I would not recommend this place to anyone looking to buy a car, obviously (unless you have thick skin, are an experienced car buyer, and have a take-no-shit-from-car-salesman attitude, because they do have some great cars), so...take a look at your Yelp rating, guys. Everyone thinks you suck!\n\n@Scout S.: I too test drove a Jeep Liberty, and it was on empty, too! \n@Annemarie L.: I wish I'd checked the reviews online, too. I probably would have gone to Tempe Autoplex instead, where my g/f bought her Honda and has never had a problem."
2,Update -- went back here and got the lamb (#2 I think) and it was just okay...stick to the vegetarian sampler platter.
4,Barro's pizza is absolutely the best delivery pizza you can get in phoenix in my opinion. They are alway nice to talk to and accurate as ever. we always order extra ranch and hot wing sauce and they have never forgotten anything. This is my go to place for pizza.
2,"The food is good but the second time I went there with my child the line was not moving at all.  I could see it taking considerable time to get my order so I  left.  They need to figure out a way to speed things up.  There were other people with kids behind us, who were also getting ancy.  It was about 10 minutes with one person and there were 5 or  6 people in line just waiting to place the order."
0,"An awesome place to burn an entire Saturday morning. The place is tiny, yet the staff has a tough time getting food to your table in under an hour. \n\nThe French toast had an overwhelming taste of onions as it was most likely cooked on or next to the gyro on the next table. The English muffins are flown in upon order from England...that is, I assume such since it didn't make its appearance until I was paying the check. The soup was blah...I never really got to taste it because it defied the 2nd law of thermodynamics as it never chilled.\n\nAnyone who is familiar with logistics will sure to suffer a major anxiety and/or panic attack. The disorganization is beyond anything seen since computers were invented."
3,Food was very good and the staff was very pleasant. The food was priced a little higher than expected but overall very inexpensive for that area. Will go there again.
4,"I was pretty nervous after reading all of these negative reviews, but I called, was picked up promptly, and taken where I needed to go safely. Got pretty great service at 4:30am."
0,"I have received a message from the corporate office manager, Jeanette, related to my  email but have not actually spoken to her-I did call her back twice, so far. My last call was Monday Oct 28, 2013 prior to my scheduled laser hair removal (LHR) apt but she just stepped into a meeting. \n\nI went to my appointment. Staff escorted me to the YAG room. I refused treatment. Told them that they have lied to me and I would not have treatment with the YAG. I left and wrote the following email to the corporate office.....\n\nI am incredibly unhappy with the services at the Scottsdale,AZ office!!!!!! I have exchanged messages with Jeanette at the corporate office in Utah but have not been successful in an actual conversation. My final attempt at an effective treatment was Monday October 28, 2013 at 2pm at the Pima Rd location. I left without getting LHR treatment and at this point, I would appreciate a refund for four of the six paid treatments. The staff is offensive and unfriendly and lie about the laser they use!!!! I am appalled!! I worked as a registered nurse in medical aesthetics for two years, I do have knowledge and the staff disregard clients opinions and expectations. Please contact me for discussion of a refund. Thank you, Carolyn Burr\n\nI hope they make things right. I'll let you know"
4,"Athens Gyros & Pasta is my favorite place to get gyros in The Valley. I discovered this place after some friends found it one random day. It was fieldtrip time for us as we piled into the car and walked in, curious if this tiny, hole-in-the-wall restaurant was going to deliver good food. Just like most small restaurants; the food was out of this world! I've been several, SEVERAL times, and even though I no longer live in that neighborhood, I still re-route on the way back from work every so often to stop by and grab the chicken gyro combo. \n\nThe chicken gyro is my all-time favorite! They pile it high with meat and add just the right amount of sauce EVERY time. The fries that come with it are also dee-lish, not comparable to McDonalds or Del Taco Fries...they're more like those amazing county fair fries. \n\nThe ladies that work there are always so sweet, every single time (and I've been dining PLENTY of times at this place).\n\nIf you're in the area, skip the Denny's or Burger King in the parking lot, and stop by Athens to try a gyro, you won't be disappointed.\n\n(On a side note, the \""atmosphere\"" of this place may not be up to par with the big restaurants or East Valley dining, but I'm someone who goes for food and service, the look of the restaurant is last on my list.)"
4,"Dear Envy,\n\nI dream of your filet mignon daily.  And the truffle fries.  If I ever had to choose a last meal, that would be it.\n\nGo here, folks.  You won't be disappointed.  Granted, it's off the strip away from the glitz and glamour of the strip and some of the other steak eateries in Vegas, but it's well worth the trip (and there's never a wait for dinner).  This place has the *best* steaks, and they always come perfectly cooked and prepared.  And don't you dare walk out without trying the truffle fries-- they are worth every calorie."
0,"would of been a decent experience if chef mayra stayed in kitchen. we had groupon and couldn't convince our men to come. so we called in advance and made reservations. took a cab to the outskirts of Vegas down by train tracks bridges. slums.we go in and see about 10 tables. reservations for this? the waitress acted scared about us having 2 groupons ( 10. 0ff 20.00). A FEW mins later the chef came out and caused a scene about how she is a small business owner and can't afford to give  out free food. explained we had called and would of cancelled groupons and we spent  Alot of money just to get here. she looked real hateful to waitess  i thought she may beat her. so i told chef it wasn't her fault. now Im angry because everyone is starring and Im not on welfare. my friend said we are going way over groupon.they spent over 30.00 over groupon making lunch for 2@ 50.00. no way is that free. menu... we 1st ordered frozen coffee drinks. it was out of service along with smoothies. ok. then i ordered Glutten free pancakes and was told i would have had to order those when i made reservations because it takes time for her to make batter. come on who knows a menu and preorders pancakes? i ordered Glutten free quesadillas\n.they were ok but now Im totally upset about the whole situation and know  Im going to wait at least 45 mins for them. to the manager*... if you want your slum location holein the wall to make it... then step up your menu... have available what is on your menu(accommodate your patrons) and never come out and complain about your groupons that you offer. my sister sent my groupon to me as a gift, meaning you could buy a additional groupon.never treat your guests as they are welfare recipients. I've never been treated like that from any groupon. 50.00 for lunch is not free. 10 tables and you still can't make some batter. really?  reservations ha! i wished i would have took a picture to post for what this Bipolar chef is wanting reservations for. save your money and go somewhere else. F-"
3,"I enjoyed my first Beerhive experience.  The beer selection is very good, not great like some make it out to be, but very good none the less (too many overly hoppy beers).  The food is pretty good, for bar food.  I had the jalepeno and cheddar burger, and it was really good!\n\nThe bartender must have been new and new to the whole industry.  She was very nice and attentive, but didn't really know what she was doing.  We ordered an appetizer that came out with our food, not a fan of that happening.\n\nAll in all a good place that I like and will, without a doubt, go back."
1,"I am a thrift store hound and this goodwill sucks. I do frequent it because its in my neighborhood, but if given the chance, I go elsewhere. First of all, I noticed many reviewers complaining of reduced inventory. that is because of the goodwill scandal in the news about how they handle their finances and that the upper management of this supposed charity organization rakes in millions of dollars every year. so many simply will not give their donations to goodwill anymore. second, and I have noticed this at other thrift stores too now that thrifting has become trendy...the prices have skyrocketed. but more so in this store probably because its in ahwatukee and they know the affluent residents will pay the prices. however, I have noticed some ridiculous price tags on used items whereas it was either more than you could buy new at wal mart or ikea or only a dollar or two cheaper than new. I routinely shake my head when I'm in there at the prices they want for junk. the staff here is usually very very rude and cold and unprofessional. however, around Halloween I noticed a lot of new faces that seemed to be friendlier. beware when you buy electronics, they do not test them and they are often broken/don't work. also, around the holidays esp Halloween, they price gauge BIG TIME! they take everyday clothing and put it on their costume racks and double the price...then, because its for Halloween they will not refund or exchange it. I bought a graduation robe and they had it on the Halloween rack for $10! one flimsy piece of material! It was the wrong color and they wouldn't exchange or refund. I found the same robe at savers for 3.99. Finally, I don't like the fact that every time you buy something, they ask you to round up and donate your change from your purchase. So I usually say no because of their high prices and the fact that I already donate by buying things and also donating my belongings there. when I say no, they usually give me a cold look, but its on principle."
0,"The old lady ticket taker at the door is so mean to my daughter and upset her.  How hard it is to greet and take a ticket ! Why can't we stroll around while waiting for the movie to start. She make us feel small, like we broke some rule. Geeze, get a life lady, it's a movie theater. I would like to be able to walk where I like and eating my popcorn and see all the posters !"
4,My new favorite Thay-Malay joint in LV. We were a party of 12 Including 6 kids. Were seated in no time. Food was delicious and promptly served. Would definitely visit again during the next trip to LV.
2,"Inexpensive dive with a ton of both character and characters! More room to strech out your arms and legs outside than inside, but outside the smokers reign. We've spent a few sunny afternoons here coughing dust from the unpaved parking lot. Good pour on those mixed drinks, too. \nI've never used the bathroom here."
0,"I really hate seeing a move here.  They really need to crack down on all the kids they just let run around.  I wish the Theatre would actually have someone come into the movies and ask the people to leave that cant keep there mouth shut.  This seems to be the only theatre in town that I have had this problem.  I am not at the movies to here your unsupervised kids or teens talk and yell I am there to see the movie.\n\nI hope that the theatre cracks down on this, but until then I will avoid this theatre at all costs."
4,"We were in Vegas for New Year's weekend and were so happy that Nannies & Housekeepers USA was able to accomodate our request for a sitter on short notice.  This agency is very professional.  They called and emailed to confirm the time for the sitter to arrive and even offered to provide a resume for our sitter in advance.  \n\nWe have a very active two-year old daughter and we were nervous about leaving her with a sitter, but Madeline was FANTASTIC.  We definitely will request her again the next time we are in Vegas.  She was sitting down and reading a book with our daughter within a few minutes of arriving at our hotel room.  We were out on the town for about 4 hours and came back to find our daughter fast asleep.  She had a great time with Madeline."
0,"Liked this facility until I had a bad experience w another member. I go to the gym and mind my own business, always. Out of nowhere some loser I've never seen makes a very inappropriate gesture to me. Since then he still disgusts me.  It's really too bad this gym is attracting that type of clientele.  Look out for the ugly guy in the black beater.  Im prob going to find a new gym to go to. This type of nonsense is just uncalled for to say the least."
2,"Do you enjoy non healthy treats! this is your place. I stop at this place in a random day, and decided to try it. \n\nFriendly service made me stay longer and finally decided what to try. A oatmeal chocolate chip with meant and chocolate ice cream.  The cookie tastes ok (not the mos complicated recipe I guess). Ice cream...it is really home made...not italian style for my taste buds, but still ok. \n\nI had only half a cookie and it was MORE than enough!. For a society that can't taste glucose at 10%, this treat will surpass your sugary expectations ;)"
0,"Ok, thanks for erasing my comments.\n\nThis vet is all about the money since they moved into a huge facility.  Everything is about the treatment plan and we will never return.  This is Vet place not a bank.\n\nThey even made us pay for putting our dog down upfront after being a customer for 14 years.\n\nI would not recommend this business at all.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nMolly's parents"
3,"I am not a pizza lover -usually.  I don't ever plan to go out for pizza, it just happens. We're running errands and it is fast and so we eat pizza. \nMy husband, however loves pizza. I mean, LOVES pizza. He loves deep dish pizza, which is my least favorite. But, like most pizza lovers, he just loves any type of pizza.\nIf I'm to have pizza, I prefer it thin . This is why I loved Pizza Brutta. We were on our way out of Madison and my sister in law recommended this place. \nWe loved it! When we go back, we'll make sure to visit them.\nThe owner stopped by our table to see how everything was, so that's nice."
1,"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117.\n\nIf you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average.\n\nThe main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson.\n\nIf you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot."
3,"Found another hidden pocket of goodness- to make you sleep within 7 minutes of finishing your meal!! No kidding! If you're having problems sleeping at night make sure to check this place out for dinner! ;) Your taste buds will enjoy the food and your brain will enjoy its \""powers\"" to put you to sleep (like a food coma). But really- the dishes were delectable. \n\nThis is in the NE corner if 101-N and Broadway. With the outside sign a bit tattered, this little market still boasts a dining experience to talk about. Staff immediately greeted and asked whether it was dining in or ordering to go and chose to dine in. To the right there were several tables and booths to choose from. Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious. Ended up buying a few more baklava to go!\nOnce you're done just check out with the pleasant cashier at the front, and off to get some powerful coffee or to that comfy bed awaiting. ;)"
0,"This place sucks. Food sucks and well drinks are watered down. Waiters are slow, bouncers have something up their butts...you're not a real cop so relax! And the prejudice vibe, ugh people c'mon get over yourselves already."
2,"A well placed Pool Table greets you when you enter here via the side door. If I'd known it had that I'd have been in ages ago. Compared to a lot of pub tables in Edinburgh this one has practically no bad spots from which to take your shots. A well priced bar and decently maintained interior round out a good drinking experience, especially if you want to unobtrusively see some local culture and maybe get some banter or at least a chat about the football. 2013  Now under new management & re-named The Other Place the pool table has gone, the range of beers has increased, the bar's moved to the east wall and food is being served. Bar prices are the same as more central establishments now but the general atmosphere is pretty relaxed and mature. Having not sampled anything off the food menu I've docked a star for now."
1,"Really, $5 for a smashed burger and little flavor?  Can't say that I will be back, except for the fried pickles, maybe.  \n\nI guess there are certain burger joints that I don't understand, this is one of them.  I heard great things but was very disappointed.  The flavor of the burger just wasn't there.  I was not a fan of the fries, too much rosemary for me.  Again, the fried pickles were amazing and they serve beer, so that was a bonus.\n\nMaybe it was just me, but still worth a try for those of you who have not ate here."
0,"Update: the manager Annie has yet to call me. Either Jen didn't tell her manager about her horrendous customer service skills, or Annie isn't woman enough to deal with customer complaints. Overall fail in this locations lack of care. Beware!"
4,This restaurant is amazing. Off the charts in every area. It is an Exceptional experience in all of the categories that I can think of. Food presentation it is a 10! Taste of food ...out of the ballpark 10+++ the comfort and beauty is outstanding. Servers and staff. So Great!  The details here are Fabulous!!  Visit here soon and enjoy one the most  lovely dining venues you will ever go to!  This restaurant is such a pleasure to review. Las Vegas has a true jewel in the SW.
0,"Fail. \n\nI didn't even get past the hard-sell guys at the front. The guy was such a jerk about my failure to choose their paint protector that I said forget it and left. As I was leaving, he said, \""I was just trying to school you in wax.\"" \n\nReally, Walter White? I didn't even bother arguing with this failure of humanity.\n\nThe guy said carnuba was melts at 86 degrees. Yes, it does melt at 86 degrees. CELSIUS! That's about 187 degrees Farenheit. So, as soon as it gets to 187 degrees out, their salespeople will TOTALLY be right.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go anywhere else. Suggestion: Clean Freak. You might have to do it yourself at Clean Freak, but I promise you'll do a better job."
4,"5/5 is definitely earned here! Great place to just come kick back with friends and play games! My friends and I bring our gaming computers and play a bunch of variety of games and have awesome fun! If you're looking for a place to play games with friends, get out of the house, or drop the kids off, this is the place!"
0,"I feel like I can't trust yelp reviews in vegas... The only thing that this place has going for them is that everything is cheap. Like most dishes are 5 or 6 dollars.\n\nOrdered:\n-hoi nam chicken over special seasoned rice (boneless dark)\n-curry chicken with roti pancakes\n-salt and pepper fish\n-thai tea\n\nThe only thing that was okay was the dark chicken, and not enough to make me want to come back. My husband, however, wants to give it a second try bc the prices are so cheap. Let's hope we can find something good on their menu. \n\nThe lady serving was rude... But I think that's pretty typical of Asian restaurants, so I didn't find that too offensive.\n\nAlso, i wonder why they can't use reusable plastic cups when they clearly wash their plates. All beverages are served in styrofoam cups. Ugh. I hate styrofoam. Not just bc it's not eco-friendly, but I might have an irrational fear of styrofoam. I hate the sounds and texture. It's just gross. :( Please get real cups!"
4,The best place for an artic swirl. :)
1,"We paid $110 for our meal at Poppy Den and walked out hungry after two hours. Yikes.\n\nMy husband thought the hostess at the front was kind of rude but I didn't notice that myself. I did notice that after we were seated, it took a LONG TIME for anyone to bring us menus or water. Yes, the restaurant was busy but there were about a million servers walking around so I am not sure why everything took so long.\n\nWe ordered our food, one small and one large plate per person which our waitress explained is not the thing to do here, as it is a \""shared concept.\"" Ok, every meal we have is a shared concept so whatever, bring the plates out however you want!\n\nMy watermelon and goat cheese salad with candied wasabi was YUMMY but I wish the watermelon had been a little more chilled. Warm watermelon... no thanks. This was honestly my favorite dish. I didn't care as much for the crab toast my husband ordered but it was decent.\n\nOur large plates took about a million years to arrive. We just sat there and sat there and sat there. The waitress offered to get us some fries or something in between and it took SO LONG that I honestly feel that at any other restaurant that would be comped but maybe we didn't spend enough money to warrant special treatment. The fries with \""kim cheese\"" sauce were not so great but we were hungry so we ate them. The sauce is waaaay too sweet and the fries are obviously frozen.\n\nLarge plates...  this is a hilarious misnomer because the pieces of fish are itsy bitsy. My husband's striped bass with edamame puree was honestly yummy. I kept stealing bites. My mahi mahi on onion jam with dill was totally blah. The fish had no flavor and the onion jam was cold so the whole dish quickly became a gross lukewarm.\n\nOur waitress was honestly quite pleasant despite the restaurant's hiccups and mediocre food but overall I just felt ripped off. I'd like more food, more quality and more service (seriously, the length of time we waited between courses was outrageous) for the three-figure price tag. I'm not sure that even the promise of the free champagne happy hour for ladies could bring me back."
1,"Aside from the refreshing views of its pools and landscaped courtyards, the Buffet falls short of an aria.\n\nThe selection boasts Alaskan King Crab Legs (diminutive, a bit salty), made-to-order pastas and omelets, sushi (more CA rolls than actual sushi), pizza, salad bar (very unexciting), and a carving station (the salmon baked in salt was A-OK).\n\nAria's buffet only saving grace lies in its taste of sweet. I really liked the grand Marnier cream puff. Sugar-free desserts (chocolate gelato, key lime pie) were scarce but good.  Pastry Chef Jean-Philippe Maury 's gives you a sample of his signature creations at the Buffet; but for full indulgence check out his patisserie next to the guest elevators."
3,"Delicious Cuban food and great salsa music. If you are looking for a Latin night when visiting Las Vegas, call them, it's great. Nice place and friendly people."
0,This company is in the business of ripping off customers and if your a senior you better watch out. Due to a class action lawsuit in my community I had to let Delta Mechanical (the only company choosen to do work named in the lawsuit) to re-pipe my home. Upon them walking my home the informed me the cost was going to be a additional $900 above the allowable amount in the lawsuit.  I agreed to pay the additional amount. Upon ripping my walls to shreads for 3 days they infom me that they need to tear out my kitchen tile and concrete to put pipes to the kitchen sink or put in smaller pipe to which I would not be able to use my kitchen sink and dishwasher at the sametime.  They wanted an additonal amount of money and not going to replace the tile.  Upon contacting the city inspector they are attemping to do the job incorrectly and are not going to complete the job until I pay more.  They under bid the job they need to make it right.  I now have a non working kitchen and not resolution in sight. Beware of this company.
2,"Some positives:\n- they made a good brandy old fashioned\n- oysters were decent\n- boiled potatoes were really tasty\n- a great space\n\nSome thing to improve on:\n- the fried chicken breading was too heavy and doughy.\n- a very random feeling menu, expected more seafood options. None of the burgers sounded appealing. Braunschweiger? Really?\n- no drink specials"
4,"Have been here twice. The food and service gets better each time I eat here. Glad this \""neighborhood gem\"" is close to where I live as I expect this will be a regular stop."
0,"Make no mistake, this is a booze cruise and is not family friendly.  We had observed the booze cruise of tubes from one of the recreation areas along the Salt River, but still wanted to give it a try as my daughter was finally old enough to go.  We thought that father's day might be a little tamer than the usual outing.  Who knows, it might have been.  Everyone brings marshmallows and litters them throughout the river.  One group had marshmallows the size of bricks.  I had to pick up one to figure out what it was.  Drunk people will also shot their water guns at you for fun, even if you have a small child.  Probably because they are drunk.  Some children through some water balloons at my wife.  When she confronted them, the father asked her what she was going to do about it.  This is a good representation of the type of people on the river.  I can see how this would be fun for social drinks, with or without kids, I suppose.  Bring your alcohol, and when you're done with a can, throw it into the river.  The bottom is lined with cans.  No glass is allowed.  It is also expensive for tubing compared to other tubing trips I've been on.  But guess what folks, that's how a monopoly operates.  High prices and poor customer service."
2,"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 and not 4 stars is because the black bean burger wasn't that good. I've had plenty of black bean burgers in my life, but the patty was a bit mushy--the consistency was just off for some reason. I can't explain it. \n\nThe fries were the only saving grace.  Man those things are good. Thin and crispy the way they should be.  \n\nThe BB burger is really my only option since I don't eat meat. Maybe I will go back for the fries."
4,"Was in Vegas for a little getaway and my mod burned out. I was actually going to another shop when my wife spotted this place. We stopped by and I'm glad I did. The lady and gentleman there were very kind and helpful. When I'm in town again and need something, I'll definitely be stopping by this place. Thanks guys!"
1,"I couldn't agree with David more.  The owner is definitley an interesting  person.  The more money she thinks you make, the more she will talk to and love you!  So tell her you are RICH!! (Sorry Didi C.) As for the food -  Ho hum VN food at high for what you get prices.  The Pho is very avg and double the usual price. They don't charge a corkage fee for  BYOB which is nice."
2,This is now Dilon's---a BBQ joint with decent food. Their sauce lacks punch (the Cajun is spicy but just nasty) but the service was very good and the burnt ends where delicious as always. The beans are a particular treat compared to some other BBQ places.
2,"The Attic is a nice place to start or end your uptown evening, and is a unique place in that it connects to its sister bar/pub, Madison's.\n\nA lot of people apparently feel the same way I do, however, because this place gets slammed on the weekends, and its not really that big!\n\nThey have pretty good music, some live, some DJ/jukebox oriented.\nThe balcony is a cool area too. \n\nOverall, the Attic is one of my favorite places to chill, as long as its not too crowded. I may have to check it out during the week."
2,"Paris hotel has a hint of a 19th Century theme, so don't expect it to be very \""modern\"". It's more focused on the well known Parisian elegance and opulence. It has some ups and downs, for instance; in one hand the rates are fair, the newly re-modeled rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful; at least the few I interacted with. On the other hand; the bad hand, cleanliness and upkeep is only a facade until you get to your room. In one of the stands in the room, there was a dried up fluid stain in the surface. In addition, the love-seat in the room had a 2-3 inch tear in the back rest. How long has that been there? no way to tell. The hotel seems to have a constant costumer tempo and shutting a room down for every minor repair is preposterous. However, a thorough cleaning before/after a costumer is not too much to ask, is it? and how hard is it to stitch up a  torn fabric? Because of the lack of attention to detail is why Paris deserves a border-line three our of five."
0,"I'm a regular at the other location. I stopped by this one for the first time. The bartenders were very nice. The older manager \\owner was a complete jerk. I've never been treated or treated a customer so rudely before.  There are so many other bars in town, go somewhere else."
2,"Went here with Tori on Sunday and we had a really good time. The restauraunt surrounds a duck pond and we are both big duck fans so we sat outside and the ambiance was great. This is the perfect spot for wedding or work parties. The patios are huge. The food was ok, we just split the chile verde and it was spicy and the pork was really tender. We also had sangria and although a bit sweet for my tastes it was still pretty good."
1,"Il \u00e9tait t\u00f4t (17 h) et nous voulions aller prendre un verre et discuter entre amis. Notre ami de Ho-Ma ayant vu de la pub pour ce resto, nous d\u00e9cidons d'y aller.\n\nLe tout d\u00e9bute bien : un d\u00e9cor invitant et soign\u00e9, de beaux d\u00e9tails \u00e0 la table (menu sur planche de bois, par exemple), musique lounge...\n\nPremier accrochage : le serveur qui nous re\u00e7oit n'est pas heureux d'apprendre que nous ne voulons \u00ab que \u00bb prendre un verre et tente de nous assoir au bar plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 une table (alors que le resto est vide et qu'il l'est demeur\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 notre d\u00e9part). C'est infiniment plate d'\u00eatre assis en ligne lorsqu'on a envie de parler en gang ! Finalement, nous obtenons d'\u00eatre assis \u00e0 une table...\n\nDeuxi\u00e8me accrochage : aucunement int\u00e9ress\u00e9e d'entendre ce dont nous avons envie, notre serveuse nous d\u00e9bite un long discours sur le concept du restaurant et les plats du jour. Lorsqu'elle nous demande enfin ce que nous voulons, elle fait la moue et devient froide lorsque nous l'informons que nous voulons prendre un verre. (D\u00e9cid\u00e9ment...)\n\nNous choisissons des cocktails maison (~10 $) et un plateau de fromages (~25 $) qui, faut-il le souligner, furent excellents et bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n\nPlus tard, la serveuse nous fait encore une face de boeuf en apprenant que nous ne continuons pas notre soir\u00e9e dans le resto. Elle se lance dans un discours-fleuve pour nous expliquer que nous manquons quelque chose et que nous sommes dans le meilleur restaurant de Montr\u00e9al (excusez du peu !)\n\nCe que le personnel n'a pas compris, c'est que s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 moins pr\u00e9tentieux, plus cools et plus \u00e0 l'\u00e9coute de nos besoins, nous serions probablement rest\u00e9s l\u00e0 pour souper : le menu avait l'air int\u00e9ressant (m\u00eame si nettement plus cher que ce que nous avions pr\u00e9vu ce jour-l\u00e0) d'autant plus qu'il semblait y avoir un r\u00e9el effort pour rester dans le concept de la chasse avec des recettes originales.\n\nInutile de dire que nous avons fini la soir\u00e9e ailleurs : passer une soir\u00e9e \u00e0 se sentir des moins que rien ne fait pas partie de nos fantasmes."
0,"Cheap if you're there for a few days, but ungodly slow.  Stops every 50 feet or so. Spend the money on a cab and get to.and from where you want to go in a timely manner."
2,"I came here 2 years ago, and I couldnt stop raving about this club after the trip. This place was poppin  - the decor, the music, and the rooftop view !! I loved it !\n\nThis past trip however ... was full of disappointment. We were on the guestlist...and still waited a good 45 mins in line. This place was super crowded by 11ish and we literally had to push through the crowds to get through to the clubs. \n\nMy friends weren't having it that night and couldnt stand the music so we went in search for the Hip Hop / R&B room. After their many flights of stairs, we finally get to this teeny tiny room that was probably 900 sq ft. We were seriously rubbing elbows with these gigantic size chicks dancing around us. Dance for less than 15 mins and bounced.... but guess what ? Couldnt just bounce ... had to trek through miles of stair cases before finally leaving that damn club. \n\nOverall, disappointed."
0,Streets closed permanently in January 2014.  Too bad... it was a great concept.  Someone should pick up on the idea and try it again.  I was told the reason it closed was that the coordinator moved.
4,"Four Peaks is an awesome place to go with friends for dinner and of course great beer!  They have an awesome selection of ales ~ IPA's that are brewed on site. The atmosphere and decor and decor are cool. \n\nI recommend setting on their patio ~ weather permitting and getting some apps and try the sample orders.  Then pick a beer you like best ~ I like the hop knot but then there;s the kilt lifter, and then order some great grub!  They have really good sandwiches and other good eats."
0,"Terrible service. My husband and I came here about a month ago before seeing a show (we are locals). We had no consistent waiter/waitress. It was obviously shift change and no one could figure out who was waiting on our table. The apps took forever and we saw half of the order sitting under the heat lamps for ten minutes before it got brought to us. Just a bad experience over all. This past Saturday night we decided to give it another try. We thought we'd sit at the bar this time because we should definitely get better service there. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong side of the bar. The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia. I think he was crushing on the woman because she really tied up all of his attention while they were there. It's too bad because we will not be going back there ever again because of the lack of service that we received on both occasions."
0,"Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the \""unspoken house rules\"": \n\n1. Order first (do not try and sit down).\n2. Wait for your food while standing.\n3. Find a seat (if one is available).\n\nUnder no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.\n\nMy wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.\n\nLittle did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: \""you can either sit there or there\"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the \""unwritten rules\"" to us.  An \""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down\"" would have sufficed.\n\nSo, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."
0,"First i will say that the food was delicious! However $60.00 for 2 burgers, fries, a slice of cheesecake & a coke is a little crazy.  At that price you want to finish your meal but it was too much food!  Maybe they could give smaller portions and charge a little less. One order of fries would serve 2 people.\n\nService was beyond horrible. We ordered takeout to take back to our room.  I ordered a cheeseburger plain (just cheese) & fries.  My daughter then said that she wanted the exact same.  When I saw the man working behind the counter I saw him wrap up a burger with lettuce & tomato & start to put it on our bag.  I reminded him that she had wanted her burger plain too.....he was visibly angry and asked why she hadn't told him that.  I said she did tell him when she said she wanted her burger \""exactly\"" like mine.  He then scooped all of the toppings off the burger slammed the bun on wrapped it up threw it in the bag.  \n\nHe then started throwing dishes around (no lie) to the point that even his co-workers were staring at him.  It was all just surreal.  I can honestly say that had not/was not ever rude to this man, but I was not willing to pay $60 at a deli for burgers and fries & then accept a wrong order. \n\nAgain, the food was pricey but good however the service was scary."
2,"There are so many things about NV Energy that I hate.  However, I cannot give them anything lower than 3 Stars because I can't say that they're worse than any other electric company out there....here's a breakdown of my experience with them:\n\nDo I have power in my home?  YES\n\nDo I ever have any issues with the power supply that comes to my home? NO\n\nAre they prompt when responding to a change in name or setting up power for a new home purchase?  YES\n\nDo they offer online bill payment?  YES\n\nAre their electricity rates ridiculously high?  YES, my power bill is over $800 per month in the Summer...WTH?\n\nDo I have a choice of providers? NO\n\nWhen I step back and look at the overall service of this company, my only beef is the prices.  Is that their fault? or the government's for not allowing Nuclear energy in the State of Nevada?  I don't know....the frustrating part is I can't do anything about it."
2,"What's Italian for average?  Ah...passabile.  Not only that but I think the place might have a sort of identity crisis.  The place is decorated to be a traditional, upscale spot.  But then they play the loud music and hire the cast of Jersey shore, complete with the Oreganos style t-shirts, to serve.  \n\nWe've tried several pasta dishes and they were lacking originality and flavor. One bright spot is the olive oil they use.  It is very fruity and light.  The chicken was decent but, once again, flavor deficient.\n\nIn a town full of flavor and variety I would be hard pressed to come up with a reason to visit again."
4,"This place was amazing! We went at 6pm on a Saturday night. We had made a reservation but there was absolutely no wait and they got us right in. Every single person at Litchfield's was incredibly nice. The food was amazing. I had the lamb and my Husband had a steak with mash potatoes. Both of our meals were wonderful. Litchfield's itself was a bit hard to find. We asked the Valet guys outside and they pointed us in the right direction. Also, it did take us 2 hours for dinner. Which wasn't a problem for us because we were there to relax and just talk and have fun. All in all I highly recommend Litchfield's....especially if you have a Groupon! :o)"
1,"The name of this place is misleading, in my opinion this isn't a \""real\"" shabu shabu place. The broth had a distinct and overly strong Cajun spice taste, which is not what you think of when you think of the typical clean beef broth used as the base in most shabu shabu places (even if you get the spicy broth, it should be spicy but it should not be changed in flavor by the spices). The papaya salad was bland and flavorless, not spicy, vinegary, or have any \""bite\"". The little Thai style dumplings were better than the shabu shabu sadly, which is why we went there. They had a decent selection of veggies, meats, and sauces but the broth which I was really looking forward to on a cold winter night was disappointing and ruined the meal I was so looking forward to. $53 for two people (without tip)? Not worth it in my opinion. I've always gone to Swish even though it's across town from me, I know it'll be \""right\"" and consistent every time."
3,"Was in Vegas for a week for a conference held at the Aria.\n\nI stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip because the last half was for my birthday, so I can say that some rooms with the better view actually felt older...maybe just the color schema. Updated technology, comfy beds and great service. \n\nThe 24 hour restaurant is pretty good. The bake shop has some scrumptious selections including chocolate croissants. \n\nThe pool has a day club if you like that kind of thing. \n\nRight on the strip. Easy to get everywhere. The next conference a few months later I stayed at another popular hotel...I missed the Aria."
1,My Aunt and Uncle were visiting from out of town and we were thinking of a fun place to take them to. I have been to Margaritaville a few times but it has been about 3 years ago. I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere and the floor show they have with the volcano and the girl sliding down into the big margarita pitcher. Here is a list of my total experience there:\n1. Called ahead and got priority seating which worked out good- highly recommend I did ask about the balcony outside but it was closed that night. No problem I thought they will enjoy the floor show\n\n2. Ordered Chicken Caesar Salad- Not very big- soggy crouton and some soggy lettuce chicken was good but not very much.\n\n3. Waited all through dinner to see the floor show(see above).after dinner the lights dimmed the margarita pitcher started to change color and bubble. The volcano started to steam- oh the anticipation!!! Then it stopped- that was it!!!! Asked our waiter who said that the water was bad! What? Very disappointing after talking it up to the relatives!!! \n\nI don't know when we will be back but I won't order that salad and I will call and ask about the show!
3,"The medium golden wings are flawless EVERY time we order them.  The Focaccias (sp?) are delicious, although the ingredients don't seem to be consistent.  Beer is good.  I love beer, and they serve lots of it in BIG mugs.  Mmmm beer.  Good.  The taco salad is always good too.  My son loves all the food here... whatever hits the table he eats.  I love that we can substitute fries & rings with a salad, and the kid meals have a choice for carrot sticks as a side- LOVE that.  The only thing that bothers me is being charged for salad dressing.  One side comes with your order, but you have to pay for extra... if 3 people are sharing wings that becomes annoying."
4,This is my favorite spot in Vegas. They change it seasonally and it's beautiful to walk through during a night out. Make sure to go at weird times such as late night or early morning to avoid the tour groups walking through. \n\nIt is amazing they can change it to a new Season all in only one day!  Make sure to take photographs with the beautiful floral background and breathe deep to take in the aroma of all those flowers!\n\nOne of the things that makes Bellagio my favorite in Las Vegas.
4,"Absolutely the best nail salon in Vegas. High-quality work at reasonable prices with excellent customer service and very kind staff the owner Ben is one-of-a-kind!\n\nThanks, Ben Emily, Nancy and Jackie!"
2,"It's not much better than  Kady's really, but the portions are huge and it's a smidge less greasy.   Don't forget those Las Vegas prices!  The coffee is drinkable, and the waitresses were the usual skimpy outfits, which can kinda suck when the waitress really shouldn't be wearing skimpy outfits.  Oh yeah, and it's got neon lights, to distract you from the fact that it's still not much better than Kady's, which I gave 2 stars.  \n\nThe portions here are massive, so if you need a good hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking, this will surely fill you up and grease you up.  \n\nHowever, if it is possible to venture out a little further, and wait for a good meal, the nicer hotels tend actually have decent breakfasts, so long as you avoid the buffets."
0,"Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)\nThere was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. \n\nPrime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. \nHowever, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.\n\nThey do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good. They also wouldn't give us bottled water \""because we weren't Diamond Plus  members\""  Ridiculous!"
4,"For the second time, I went to Society Cafe at Encore. It's just simply one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas and worth a second visit for its striking ambiance and delicious food.\n\nThis time, I had an orechiette pasta with veggies ($19) and a side of Yukon mashed potatoes ($7). I didn't really care for the broth-y sauce on the pasta-I would have preferred a creamier one, but at least I felt like I was eating very healthily. The potatoes were amazing-such a rich flavor and a great not-too-mushy, not-too-hard texture. And the Mac and Cheese \""Bites\"" we started off with ($12) were melt-in-your-mouth yumminess.\n\nWhat I was most impressed with this time, besides the gorgeous pink, black, green and white decor and beautiful lighting, was the service. Our server was one of the best I've ever had wait on me. He was probably younger than I am, but he was so charming, so knowledgeable about the menu and so intelligent, that I felt like our table was greatly taken care. They really train their wait staff well (so does Sassi here in Scottsdale), and that impacted the meal so positively."
3,"They have the best Sourdough Soup Bowls! The Potato cheese is delicious. Their burger and fries are pretty good too. And if you love desserts, this place is for you. :)"
2,Great dive bar. Great jukebox
0,"When you don't follow the law and inundate a neighborhood with your employees (even worse when your customer service rep states they will stay out of your neighborhood- soliciting is against the law_) and they show up and laugh because they know the cops won't enforce it...shame on you.  I hope your company gets no new customers.  Worse yet, half of your employees didn't have the legally required identification badge and your employees thought that was funny.  I don't care how proficient you are, you have chosen to break laws and think that's ok."
3,"Delicious!!  Raw rolls fresh & seasoning well balanced, yet explosive in flavor. Good prices. Friendly & patient server. Docked a star since my friend waited 30 minutes (no joke) for her spider roll (something that shouldn't have taken that long to prep). My other friend & I got ours in a timely fashion, especially given how busy they were. Kind of a cozy/low-key place-limited seating. I would happily return there again!"
2,"Really more of a 3.5. \n\nQuaint, charming and lovely restaurant. Good and amiable service. \n\nTheir food has a home-cooked style to it - it's not particularly pretentious about food presentation, but it's confident in the quality and taste of the food itself. My brother ordered the duck leg (which was amazing and so tender) while I had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese.\n\nAll mains come with soup/salad and dessert. Please do yourself a favour and pick the lemon tart! My brother was a bit disappointed with his almond cake, but I definitely loved my choice.\n\nTheir wine menu was a bit odd, in my opinion. Maybe I'm not used to it, but I had to ask separately for the menu for wine by-the-glass. The menu had no description as to each type of wine - they were simply labelled 'Riesling', \""Pinot Grigio\"", etc. Would have liked to know where it's from, from year, etc. I still enjoyed my wine, but it doesn't make sense to have to ask about each wine one by one."
1,"This place is straight up garbage... The pizzas are just ok. Honestly I would rather eat dominos that this place. My friend ordered the meatballs and wow is was like frozen meatballs overcooked and dump in sauce. Would not recommend this flavorless meal. Also we ordered both soups and they were both really disgusting. The Tuscan had wayyy too much Tabasco added into it, and I love Tabasco... The other soup was just flavorless. It was like drinking water. Honestly a waste of money. Go to the food court a little farther down and get something cheaper."
4,came here for the first time on my birthday.  Took the wine 101 class. its on a monday night at 6pm. It was sooo much fun and I learned so much.  The wine was all really great and it came with delicious little pairings for each different glass.  The women who taught the class was great. I feel back I can't remember her name but she was so cute and was super knowledgable.  The best part its very reasonably prices so I love that
0,"The new Siena on West Sahara is decorated nicely but the food is bland and just average AND the service is terrible. The blond, older woman bartender brought us the menu with an icy stare and unfriendly demeanor. And acted as if she'd never seen us before while she asked for our I.D.'s (even though we've been in there 4 times recently) every time we've been in when she was working she always has an attitude. They used to have a nice, younger bartender working but we don't know what happened to her.\n\n The restaurant is new and not very busy. I would think that if they plan on staying in business they'd want that old crank to change her attitude or get out from behind the bar. I've been a bartender for 4 yrs and would never dream of acting like her while I'm working. \n\nWe've decided not to go back."
1,Crowded with overpriced food :(

0,Do not go here! After receiving acrylic nails here I had a patch of fungus underneath my nail. Never in my life have I had this issue with any other nail salon. I've heard horror stories but not I'm in one. They're equipment is either not properly sterilized or their technique is lacking. Never going to step foot in this place again!
0,"Do I have to give it a star? \nVery disappointed in this place! I can't believe all the hipe! We just got the basic chicken. \nI will never, ever go back to this place! Why pass by Popeyes and Churches chicken to go to this place! Kudos for opening a business, and creating jobs. This just doesn't float my boat!"
2,"I have been eating Alpine Valley's 9-grain bread morning, noon, and night for a few months now.  It tastes really good, and I quickly became addicted to it. \n\nAfter doing a lot of research on whole grains, their 9-grain bread doesn't get a \""Basic\"" whole grain stamp from the Whole Grains Council (www.wholegrainscouncil.org).  Alpine Valley receives a stamp on four of their breads: a \""Basic\"" stamp on one bread (their whole wheat raisin cinnamon), and a \""100%\"" stamp on three breads (their Cracked Wheat, Honey Whole Wheat, and Multi-Grain breads), so I will try to start eating those breads instead.\n\nI really think that companies that purport to sell healthy products should be 100% straightforward about the degree of health in each product.\n\nEven though my Alpine Bakery bread of choice does not get the Whole Grain stamp, eating this bread has led (without any conscious intention on my end) to no longer buttering bread (because it tastes so good that nothing, even butter, should cover up the taste), I have stopped eating ice cream and many other fatty foods, simply not wanting them anymore, not cake, or cookies, or Mexican food, everything pales to the experience of eating this bread with absolutely nothing on it.\n\nIt may be that their 9-grain bread is sufficiently healthy.  At this point, I don't know how to evaluate it except to believe that the first ingredient being Wheat Flour means the industry standard of being refined flour, where the second ingredient is Organic Whole Wheat Flour.  Is it half refined flour?"
1,"I'm a chronic Subway Eater and I'm glad that there are so many around town.  However, this location disappoints me.\n\nI've been here a few times this summer and I always feel like this place is lacking.  Lacking what you may ask?  Lacking the friendly greetings when you walk in. Lacking the attentiveness and quickness the employees come out from \""behind\"" the kitchen.  The employees are of a different caliber than other locations.  They seem like apathetic teenagers that do the bare minimum to get your out of their hair.\n\nThe last time I came in on Saturday I ordered my usual:\n\nToasted Foot Long Oven Roasted Chicken on Flat Bread with, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Pickles, Olives, Bell Pepper, Onion, Vinegar.  \n\nI didn't get the toasted part because their toaster was broken!  They did microwave it but that kind of defeats the purpose of \""eat fresh.\""  You would think a restaurant would have a backup toaster on hand as it's such a key tool in their process."
3,"A friend and I heard this place played some good beats, so we made the trip. Holy cow! Was it awesome inside.. The decor was rad. Drinks were stiff, and affordable. people were weird, and entertaining. My flannel shirt and jeans stuck out like a sore thumb though. Next time I will dress like a vampire."
1,"The food was bland and the ciabatta bread was too hard to eat, but the employees were very pleasant."
2,"My longtime California friend Chris was in town for New Year's, so we met up on New Year's Eve Eve for lunch. Comme Ca, located in the chic Cosmopolitan Hotel, offers an amazing $20 prix fixe for lunch. Not bad for a David Myers restaurant.\n\nAppetizer -\nFor the app, both of us opted for the Duck Confit \""Cinnamon Roll\"". It was a cinnamon roll with savory pieces of duck confit rolled in, served in a mini cast iron dutch oven. On the side for garnish were two pieces of crisp pork belly -- holy shiznit, AMAZINGLY delicious!!! Beautiful presentation, absolutely delicious in my mouth. This portion was definitely on the larger side. So much, that I was concerned about whether I could fit anything else in...\n\nEntr\u00e9e - \nChris had the Grilled Salmon, which he said was tasty but nothing spectacular. It was a +$10 supplement, by the way too. \nI had the Quiche Du Jour, which featured ham and roquefort. I love roquefort, but I felt that they crossed the line with integrating so MUCH of a pungent cheese in the quiche. Oh well, perhaps this is just a matter of personal preference. However, once again, it was another heaping portion! I swear, the quiche slice was 1/5 a pie, nearly a quarter of a pie. Very generous.\n\nDessert -\nChris had the Cr\u00e8me Brulee while I opted for the homemade profiteroles. They were filled with homemade ice creams - pistachio, honey, and vanilla bean. They were beautifully presented with spun sugar and drizzled with chocolate. I ate the ice cream but discarded the shells - I personally found them to be too chewy (perhaps due to the ice cream chilling the dough?). I think I would have preferred a cream filling versus the ice cream. \n\nService was superb. The uniforms are cute and not tacky.\n\nOverall, mixed feelings. I felt as if the Appetizer was delicious, but the rest was just OK. I know it was just a $20 for the meal, but next time I'll probably opt to order just the Duck Confit and not do the prix fixe -- my money would be better well spent that way. Bummer!"
0,"We have been here a couple times and it seems like the food quality and service has started to decline.  I guess they are too big now to keep the quality, too bad."
3,"Love comming here.., its part of our Memorial Day Tradition.\nJust SUPER BUMMED they closed the Premiun Outlet Mall location!!"
1,"This place is just down the street from my work. So today I figured I'd give it a try and I was so excited because it looked legit! So let's do this chronologically:\n\nI start by asking the cashier what is in their tortas aside from your choice of meat. She lists off a few ingredients including: beans, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, avocado, etc. I feel like she said there were more things included in the torta but maybe that was it. Maybe she said salsa? So I order a Torta de Milanesa with everything except tomato. No tomato. And an horchata to drink. I ordered dine-in because I didn't feel like going back to my windowless office to eat. So far so good, and the lady seems nice enough. \n\nShe gives me my horchata immediately and I turn to look for a seat. I had to take the empty chip basket and salsa dishes off my table before sitting because it hadn't been cleaned yet. I see three people come up and place an order after I've taken my seat. I've been sitting there for a while and realize I haven't been brought any chips and salsa - no biggie, I don't need it. \n\nAbout 15 minutes go by - I'm still waiting for my food and I just watched two of the people who came in after me get their food and leave. The lady comes to my table and I'm thinking she's bringing my torta - NOPE: chips and salsa. At least the chips were warm. The salsa was tasty but a little weak on the spice level. \n\nOver 5 minutes go by and I see the 3rd person get their order and walk out. As I'm turning to say something to the lady - she comes out with my torta. It took over 20 minutes just to get my food. I'm thinking - if the food is worth it, I'll just place my order over the phone ahead of time next time. \n\nThe torta de milanesa was decent at best.  First - the ONE specification I made was NO TOMATO. It had FOUR slices of tomato - which is really generous if you happen to like tomato - which I don't. The bread was slightly over-toasted so it had a slight burnt taste; there were NO jalapenos on my torta; and they skimped on the avocado. The least I can say is that it tasted good, but after 20 minutes I expected something MUCH better. \n\nNeedless to say - I'm not in a rush to return to this place. The service was slow and my meal was disappointing. Maybe in a few weeks or months I'll give it a 2nd try - after I've made my rounds at the other local Mexican places."
4,"This is our preferred theater! Relatively close. Many movies showing. Not overcrowded (we avoid the weekends). Friendly staff. Big comfy theater seats. And clean bathrooms!! \n\nMy spouse and I LOVE the $5 matinees. I noticed this deal wasn't offered this summer though. I also have a Stubs card. This gets me $10 off of concessions every time I spend $100 in tickets or food. This works great for us - a family of five. We spend $100 easy at the movies, especially since we almost always buy snacks.\n\nMy spouse and I enjoyed Monday's matinee of the Dark Night. Only a handful of people were in the theater. Nice!"
3,It was crazy the last time I was here.  They were doing some kind of slider fest special due to a tv show they were featured on.  $1 sliders brings out all the lookie lou's.  The deserts still rock and the red velvet cake I have dreams about.  The service can be sketchy but the food has always been good.
1,"Disappointing. My husband and I decided to splurge a little for our first wedding anniversary. When we checked in my husband noticed that the bathtub had hair all over it (gross!). He called housekeeping and asked them to clean it. I did my usual hotel sheets inspection and found that they were stained. My pillowcase also looked like it had a big old red punch stain. We called front desk and they sent someone to change the sheets. We left and came back later only to find the sheets were even dirtier than the previous ones! It was the flat sheet that mostly and I slept without a blanket the first night because I refused to touch the dirty sheets. We called front desk again and this time they told us to wait for the housekeeping supervisor. We were on our way out but decided to wait. After 20 minutes, we called front desk again and asked if we were indeed supposed to wait. The rude front desk person told us yes and we shouldn't expect her to come immediately but told us she'll page her anyways. WTF? The housekeeping supervisor came and was very nice and apologetic. She told us she was going to have the person working on our room to check the sheets before giving them to us. We came back later that night and guess what? The sheets were changed but still dirty! Once again, I didn't use the blanket. In fact, I didn't use a blanket for my entire 3 night stay. All the stains were huge and gross but they looked old. Come on, buy new sheets if you can't get the stains out! Note that we didn't yell or demand anything from anybody but was very nice and said thank you to everyone. We didn't even complain about the bathtub, we just asked them to come up and clean it. Everyone was nice except for that one front desk person.  They did give us a $50 food credit so I give one star for that and one star for Bellagio's big bathroom and room. Thanks, Bellagio for a memorable 1st year anniversary."
4,"These guys are the real deal. Everything about working with them was great, they have really great ideas and even saw the vision of what I was looking for.  Jason was extremely open and helpful line of communication, always just a phone call or email away. My Graphics are always professionally done and delivered at breakneck speed. They just finished designing my new website and I couldn't be happier, it runs so fast, and it just plain works! They are a good bunch of guys and they get the job done. The Price was well worth the money and i think it they were pretty competitive with it. They break it down into what you need and aren't afraid to help make your vision a reality."
0,"It's a shame- the burgers are actually good but I can't get over seeing the employee scoop my fries with his bare hands.  Ewwww.  Luckily, I said something & got new, untouched fries but can't shake the image"
2,"I booked a room at a really great rate which included a view upgrade, a $50 Food & Beverage credit and $50 Salon Spa credit. Parking is valet only (complimentary) and we had to wait quite a while when we first arrived to valet the car.  Check-in also took FOREVER and I was told that I couldn't get a view upgrade because the hotel was sold out that night. The problem with the Food & Beverage credit is that it can only be used for room service, the lobby bar, or the market cafe (but not the market part).  We ended up using it for coffees, sandwiches, juice, and desserts at the market cafe and it took 35 minutes after we ordered to get our food.  I used my Salon Spa credit for a nice manicure but I would never pay $50 for that service.\n\nThe room seemed really small despite its square footage. The kitchenette, dining area, and hall are just wasted space. The bathroom is also laid out kind of oddly, with the tub at a diagonal.  It seemed like the lack of a towel rack was a design flaw so they placed a little towel cart next to the shower. The area just didn't flow well.  Since over half of the suite is poorly laid out, the living room/bedroom area seemed really cramped.  Oh, let me also mention that the \""blackout\"" blinds leave a huge gap of light coming in.\n\nAnyway, I thought the idea of a smoke-free/gaming-free hotel is what I wanted but I ended up not liking it very much and my bf really missed the casino. We're definitely going elsewhere next time."
1,"Wandered around for 22 minutes before someone offed to help me - not a busy time of the day, not a lot of customers in the store. At this point I was irritated since I was trying to buy a decent laptop and had a dozen questions. \n\nSix days later returned and this time I wandered for over a half hour and watched employees take selfies, check Facebook, have pow wows, got shoulder checked by one guy and felt like I was interrupting a male bonding session when I needed to go and ask for assistance.\nWorst customer service imaginable. In this day in age you REALLY need to make sure you're taking care of the consumer - not making them feel bothersome. This store falls way short. There was one decent employee out of the bunch who took care of me after I griped to him. I'll look up his name and do an edit."
1,"I was disappointed in my last visit, I had the 3 tacos ( carne asada and red beef). The carne asada was really bad...tons of fat and grissle, I was only able to take 3 bites and I could not do no more. The red beef had good flavor, the problem was that the meat is cooked in a broth, so when they put it in the taco the whole tortilla was soaked and falling apart..I ended up having to pick at it with a fork.\n\nMy husband had a carne asada burrito..again the meat was not good and he did not like the cabbage ..it looked old and tasted old.\n\nThe service was solid and there are other things that I like about the place...but they need some quality control..who wants to eat fatty carne asada and soggy tacos??? \n\nTwo hippies if you are out there reading this..please...address some of these issues, I really want to come back."
3,"My 4 star rating is solely for the food. My hubster and I have always been curious about this place as we live right up the street and since the little one was spending the night at the in laws, we decided to pop in. It wasn't busy but then again it was a Thursday around 6pm. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger that came with thick crinkle cut fries and I had the chicken fingers. I only ordered them because I couldn't figure out what I wanted and I didn't want to hold up the waitress any longer so I was expecting your typical dive chicken fingers...fried with a nasty after taste and thin. I was wrong! Hands down these are the best chicken fingers I have had EVER eaten in Las Vegas (Cane's comes in a close second). Juicy, thick and hand breaded and they give you a shiyet load of them! It came with home made potato chips however I am not a potato chip fan period, so my the hubster ate them and I ate his fries (which were awesome). He also had a few of my chicken fingers and after we were done eating he said \""i feel like we've had fingers like that before.\"" We figured out that the fingers here are closely similar to the fingers at Cane's, another fave place of ours! My hubster also raved about the jalapeno burger saying it was juicy and great tasting."
3,"Beautiful non smoking condo-like rooms. Super chic and clean, with your own eat in kitchen!\n\nWe were celebrating my boyfriends birthday. It was his first time experiencing VEGAS. I am a bit of a Vegas junkie so I showed him the spots to go!\n\nIt was both of our first times staying at Vdara, it was beautiful and a bit secluded. Not a far walk to the strip and non smoking without a casino too. This is definitely for the rich families and those who come to Vegas on business.\n\nOur room was gorgeous and the woman at the front desk was super helpful and kind. She really made us feel important and gave us a room with a beautiful view. \n\nI would like to stay here again because it was quiet, comfy, and super chic. \n\nNot five stars because you're forced to valet, not many dining options on site, no convenience store (had to walk to bellagio to get hangover remedies), bar closes early,  and they don't have jacuzzi tubs. :-(\n\nBut definitely nice place to stay."
1,"Nice staff.... down hill from there. Food dried out. If you paid 7 or 8$ for the meal then maybe it would pass but for 14.95 not worth it at all. Save your money to gamble, go to mcdonalds to eat...."
3,Seriously?!?! I don't know if I should attribute the deliciousness to my seasoning  or to them for being so brilliant with the concept and execution?!\nI wish we had one closer to home. For now I only come here for lunch. It's a casual setting but also good as a dinner spot!\nI haven't even begun to tap into the many possibilities of the bowls I can create. I'll be coming back!\nBuild it yourself and pack as much into that little bowl as humanely possible!!!!
2,"Coming down from Western NY for a Monday Pirates game vs. the Braves, who I rarely get to see, my brother and I wanted to make a day of it. After doing some research of the sports bar/grills that populate the area around PNC Park and Heinz Field, Jerome Bettis' seemed like our best bet, though no place had crazy outstanding reviews. We'll let it slide that the Steelers beat our Bills just two days before!\n\nEntering at around 3:30pm after a 3 hour drive we were seated quickly at a hi-top table in the bar. Lots of TV and we liked that they had the TVs \""pre-labled\"" with which games would be showing on them in the evening. I had a nice view out the patio at the WWII memorial as well as the Fountain across the river. It was already pretty bustling with Pirates fans and a few of our fellow friends from Braves Country.\n\nToi was our waitress and was very pleasant and quick with service, even if my brother's NY Drivers License confused her when looking for his birthday :).  My brother and I both started with draft beers. They have large glasses for the $7.50 range and a wide selection of PA local and general favorites on draft. \n\nI ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Biscuit \""Sliders\"" and my brother got the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with the sauce on the side. Our food came out very quickly and was freshly made and piping hot. I sort of had low expectations for biscuits made at a sports bar, but I have to say I was very impressed. They were warm, flaky, and held together even with the BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was moist and tender and the BBQ sauce which was layered on top was nothing out of this world, but still very tangy and a good compliment. Not too spicy or salty. There were lightly battered/fried thin onion \""strings\"" on it. Those were a little tough. Might be better to have them chopped because they were hard to bite through. With a small side of basic fries, it was a filling meal. \n\nMy brother chowed down on the cheeseburger, dipping it in the BBQ sauce. He ordered it medium rare and said it was perfectly done. Good amount of toppings, large overall burger, and I could see the bacon sticking out of every side. Had a higher end, large soft bakery roll. He ate every little bit while hardly talking so I would consider that a success.\n\nPrices for downtown/near stadium food are to be expected. It was $13 for my two biscuit sliders and $12 for the burger. I think mine was a little over priced for the size, but it was still good. I did like that they had quite a few fancier salads and vegetarian items. I always take note since my mom is a vegetarian and it is rare sports bar place has these, so I would recommend it here if you have a veggie eater in your group.\n\nThe bathrooms were oddly weird... my brother went when we got there and said it was \""like a club\"". I went when we left and it was SO dark in there. I had to use my phone's flashlight app to find something in my purse. Very strange considering the rest of the restaurant is not like that."
0,"This place is as expensive as Starbucks coffee. The only difference is at Espresso Royal, you get a lower quality cup. With the Starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here. The only day worth visiting is on Wednesday because they have one dollar lattes. The seating is pretty cramped. I have no complaints about the staff. They have been very friendly."
0,"Shitty service, shitty food, and shitty manager. Manager was unbelievably rude towards my party and I will not be returning here again."
3,Much better than I expected. I always thought he was creepy but his show changed my mind. Quite loveable actually.
0,I paid $9 for a chicken caesar salad and a cup of soup. They were both really generic and way over priced. I wouldn't eat that chicken again if you paid me. Reminded me of that disgusting pre cooked chicken that comes in a plastic bag at the grocery store for salads. Not coming here again.
3,"What more could you want?  Delicious, hearty crepes.  People watching from the third floor window.  They saved us when our blood sugar was low from too long of a walk through Montreal.  Merci, Chez Suzette!  Merci!"
1,"I was in town for business, and I decided to give this place a try.\n\nThe food was good, but a little overpriced for what it was. \n\nThe service was terrible. The waitress misplaced my credit card and implied it was my fault. She said \""Im 99% sure I gave it back to you\"". \n\nAfter frantically looking all over our seats and floor for about 10 minutes,  the waitress came back with our credit card and made an excuse how she misplaced it.\n\nI'm \""99% sure\"" she wont be getting a tip....\n\nIt ruined the whole experience. \n\nI recommend going to a restaurant where they take value in protecting your credit cards."
2,"Got here at 11AM after a long night at Surrender the night before.  The guy said we had a table in the 'party zone'.  Turns out, his 'party zone' meant the side pool.  The upside to all this was that our table was in the shade and right by the pool, which meant we had a nice hideout from the scorching sun and the sea of people.\n\nWe had a $500 minimum, and ended up spending $1000, not too bad - i just wish i remember drinking all that booze.  What we all DID notice, however, was that it was quite a sausage fest at times, but i guess that's to be found anywhere.\n\nOn added note, a surprise appearance by Tiesto, Jamie Foxx, and Gabrielle Union (the latter two of which most of my group missed) is the topping on the cake. \n\nNot a bad pool to party at - the waitresses provided additional eye candy when the guests just didn't supply.  Drinks were aplenty and delicious (I recall something with lemonade being the best, but please don't take my word for it), and theres nothing better than some 'r&r' by the pool"
1,"My husband and I ate here during our recent trip to Vegas.  We were staying in the hotel and were given a coupon when we checked in.  There was a pretty big selection of foods available however none of it tasted very fresh.  The ribs were too tough to chew, the egg rolls were mushy and lacked any actual meat inside, the pastas were over cooked , and the black forest cake was the worst I have ever eaten.  Our server seemed out of it, she couldn't seem to remember our drink orders even though we were just a table of two and there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated in her section, and come on its a buffet so bringing the drinks is about the only thing they have to do.  The only thing I really did like were the pot stickers- I have a soft spot for pot stickers.  Overall I've had worse but I've definitely had better too, much better.  I probably won't return."
4,"A TOTAL DIVE WITH AMAZING FOOD! Guy Fieri needs to go here, and I am emailing him to let him know about this place.  We went on Thursday, April 7th as it was my daughter's birthday and she chose this as her place to go for lunch. She had been here before but it was my first time. If you don't know where you are going you would pass right by this place, and from the outside it doesn't look like much. Once inside, you pick a table and a waiter/waitress will come to you. The decor is not fancy, but it is fun and festive. We were asked for our drink order, and then the chips and salsa arrived. They bring a pot of red salsa, and a pot of green salsa. AMAZING RED SALSA. Be warned the salsas are spicy. You can take a first taste,think nothing of it... .and then comes the heat. We did order 2 more pots of salsa (fyi there is a charge for extra salsa). I liked the red much more than the green. The green was good too, but the red salsa has a great flavor and heat. \n     My daughter ordered a bean chimichanga with red sauce, I ordered the chile relleno dinner and ice cold beer. Shocker I know that I didn't order a margarita. The food is very, very good. I love chile rellenos and my dinner at Los Dos didn't disappoint. My daughter's chimi plate was also very good. The flavor of the food is authentic, and so good! We ordered guacamole and it tasted like they just made it...so yummy!\n     Parking can get very interesting during peak times so be aware. The service was great, and we will return here again. I can't wait to take my mom here, she will love it."
2,"This place was pretty cool. I got passes so I didn't have to pay, which was cool. The ambiance is pretty nice and I like the music they play.  The drinks weren't too expensive. I guess I've seen more expensive drinks at other nightclubs."
1,"Came here for lunch because of the 2 for 1 special and it was something new. The appearance was nice and simple, nice colors. Servers seemed friendly overall, girls were nice looking. It seemed a little slow for 1pm. Our chips and salsa took a few minutes to come out, we also got guacamole and crispy mini tacos. Presentation was decent but taste was lacking.  Guac was plain, meat in tacos was rubbery and chips were stale... We ordered street tacos that took awhile, nothing special (had a weird taste to it).\nPositives: they have no carb option street tacos (wrapped in lettuce), friendly and awesome tequila selection. (outdoor patio selection looks nice)\nI hope they are still developing the menu (taste) and concept, great potential but not sure if I would choose to come back or recommend but would tag along if someone else wanted to try."
3,"**Restaurant Week - Spring 2012**\n\nBefore I start, I should probably mention that I'm not actually a prime rib fan.  For whatever reason, prime rib has never really struck my fancy.  However, it is the hubster's favorite dinner, so when I saw Lawry's menu for RW, I thought we could give it a try.\n\nI'm so glad that we did!  First of all, the decor and atmosphere are just fun.  It's vintage to the point of tacky, which is what makes it so fun.  The waitresses did look silly with the folded-napkin bonnet, but ours was wonderful and friendly.  I could tell she had a customary way of greeting tables and explaining the process since she kept calling us \""ladies and gentlemen.\""\n\nWe started the meal with the spinning salad, which was delicious.  The dressing and croutons were sweet and garlicky, and the overall salad was a nice, fresh way to start the meal.\n\nI decided to join the hubster in getting prime rib, and to my eternal delight it was absolutely delicious!  I decided to get mine medium rather than medium-rare (the way I normally enjoy my steaks), and it made a world of difference.  The meat was tender and juicy, and flavorful in the best possible way.  I didn't even use as much horseradish as I originally thought I'd need/want to, since there was no need to mask the flavor.  \n\nThe mashed potatoes were wonderful, with a delicious gravy (and I'm not even a brown gravy fan!  Hubster had the creamed corn (his favorite), and I ordered the creamed spinach.  Both were tasty, but a definite second fiddles to the main event.\n\nWe ended the night with coffee and dessert, hubster ordering the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and me the chocolate mousse.  Both were incredibly delicious, but almost an overly rich end to an overwhelming meal. \n\nIn all honesty the main complaint I had was that there was too much food!  The 10 oz. prime rib, although scrumptious, was much too large a portion for my taste.  I wish the 7 oz. portion would have been an option for RW since I felt wasteful after I was through (ironic considering the destination of the RW proceeds)."
1,"My husband and I live down the street from this place and finally decided to try it.  Blech, never again.\n\nThe server, Tammy, was great!  In fact, the staff is really nice.  It's sad to see such great people working at a place that will probably shut down in a month or two.  My husband ordered the \""Fireball\"" burger and said that there was no kick whatsoever.\n\nI ordered the \""Pigskin\"" burger.  I ordered it well done and while it was completely charred on the outside (bad), there was still pink on the inside.  I work in a restaurant and I know how it should look.  There is supposed to be bacon in the meat mixture, could not taste it at all.  In fact the burger as a whole did not have any flavor to it.  Wendy's burgers have more flavor!\n\nThe onion rings are really good!  In fact the best I've had yet.  The fries are good too, they lightly sprinkle some seasoning salt on them (so don' t add salt!).  My husband really liked his bloody mary.  \n\nThe other con was that other than us, there was one other table and our food still took a long time to come out.  \n\nWe won't go back.  The food is unimpressive and there are other places I can spend my tips."
1,"I was excited to try this place out because I was a big fan of Chuys when it was there. When first walking in it looks just like Chuys did there is no difference. I was hoping the food could compare to what Chuys had offered in the past. We ordered a couple of appetizers so we could try a few things. The quesadilla was fantastic. great flavor and a great crunch to the tortilla so instantly we were excited. The empanadas though were as bland as can be. 1-2 on the appetizers. The beer selection is good most Mexican beers you would want on tap and one of my favs Moose Drool. Now on to the entrees. A little pricey if you ask me. 10 bucks for chimichanga is high but I was here to see if it was worth it so I went with the chicken. It wasn't worth it. The chimi was just as bland as can be. I can get better flavor for less money at Carolina's, Macayo's or Manuels. My girlfriend got the chili relleno and to be honest I don't even know how to explain what hers tasted like but it did not taste like what a chili relleno should. Service was good, our waitress was quirky but very friendly and I didn't go without beer in my glass which is good."
3,"ACP is situated on the famous St. Denis street which has lots of bars, nightclubs and restaurants on it. So a restaurant has to be special in order to stand out from this huge assortment of eateries, and ACP does exactly that. First of all let's be clear about the price tag that is associated with this French cuisine \""gastronomie\"" experience. You'd easily end up paying around $90-100 per person (aperitif, entree, dessert, coffee, tips and tax). \n\nThe decor is good in a rustic way. There's no printed menu, all the available items are written on a blackboard which covers more than half the wall adjacent to the counter. The waitress who served us, very cheerfully and patiently, explained in detail all the ingredients in the menu items we chose and how they were cooked and would be served. Although the item list is pretty limited, they have chicken, mutton, beef, fish and veggie well covered. I chose escalope de veau as my main dish with coquille St. Jacques as the entree. Both these items were very delicious. The veal escalope was served with green beans and roasted tomatoes with a chef's speciality creamy sauce. Although the portions are medium sized (you won't expect big portions in a French restaurant anyway) they compensate it with giving you a lot of bread and butter that you can have with your entree or even with your main course. \n\nWe ordered Margot 99 (I don't remember exactly) to go with our order and it was sublime. I chose mousse au chocolat as dessert and an espresso to go with it. Needless to say that the dessert was excellent as well. \n\nThe only thing which would stop me from going back to this restaurant is that it's very pricey. Apart from that it's a very good place to eat with excellent decor and ambiance. Oh and if you'd like to have a digestif, they serve cognac/grand marnier as well. Just don't drive after all these Margots and Cognacs otherwise you'd be paying about the same price in traffic tickets to SAAQ hehe."
1,"Went to Enso's for a friend's birthday.  His girlfriend had tried to make reservations for 7 or 7:30.  She was told that 8 was the earliest.  No big deal, except when we showed up at 7:30 it was not crowded at all and we were seated right away.  At our tables there were already glasses of water waiting.  However, they already had beads of condensation on them and the ice cubes had already melted.  I had ordered Pad Thai, not wanting sushi (for once), mistake.  The Pad Thai was horrible.  I can buy instant Pad Thai at an Asian Market that has more flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian Beef, that was better than the Pad Thai, though that's not saying much.  There were A LOT of green onions.  One of our friend's order the Asian Pepper Steak, he could see the peppercorns.  The birthday man, ordered sushi.  He said he's had better, for less.  As far as the ambience, it was a little bizarre that they were showing a kung fu movie in the restaurant, some of the staff looked like they were wanting to sell more than what was on the menu.  The drinks were tasty, that's why I gave them 2 stars.  Over priced and most definitely not worth the hype. I'm pretty sure none of us will be going back."
4,Just got back from the Rio - Excellent experience.  Great room - very spacious.  Terrific bed! - very clean.  The shuttle service is sooo convenient.  Very friendly staff.  Fridge works very well.  So very comfortable - good security.  Found two places to eat that were marvelous.  Hash House  A Go Go - zagat rated - and a steak and hamburger restaurant (can't think of the name). Neither expensive.  Only complaint  way too much food.  Share the order.  Really don't like monstrous amounts of food - such a waste - for me anyway.  But it is delicious - especially the hamburgers! - Terrific breakfasts.
4,"I am one of the many who trekked to this old school restaurant because of Mr. Bourdain.\n\nAnd damn was he right again!\n\nIt is CRUCIAL that you get seated in fireside lounge. We almost got seated in the regular diner area and that is not the experience you should be looking for!\n\nMy boyfriend and I split a scorpion bowl and a plate of chicken strips and fries. Both were gigantic and plenty for both of us. They are particularly generous with their fries.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly I loved the dim lighting and ambiance overall.\n\nOnly downside is that it wasn't a cheap cab ride there. But it is worth it, believe me!\n\nCan't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas so I can get a seat right in front of the fireplace!"
1,"I was so hoping that this was going to be my new walking distance thai restaurant, but I was wrong. \n\nDecided to order some appetizers and an entree to share with my husband for lunch.  \n\nThe fresh rolls were pretty disappointing.  I didn't like the chemically smell that they gave off and the accompanying sauce tasted too much like melted peanut butter with no acidity to cut through the richness. \n\nThe crab rangoon was delicious and not oily and the accompanying sweet and sour sauce (I don't know if it comes with them or not I requested it) was very well balanced.\n\nThe fried marinated pork strips were very salty and the Jaew sauce was also salty which just overpowered everything. \n\nThe chicken curry puffs were also delicious but it was also a very small portion for the price 2 dollars per puff seemed a bit steep. \n\nThe pad thai was probably the biggest disappointment.  We did ask for it extra spicy and it was, but there was no accompanying tangy peanut sauce that I am used to on the pad thai.  They also did not put in the extra lime I requested. \n\nOverall I might give them a try again after they have time to get used to the flow, but with so many other great thai restaurants I won't be rushing back."
2,"I wish I could give them 3 1/2 stars, but I'm a tough critic. First, the positives - the service we had was excellent. Quick, friendly and attentive. As other reviewers have said, the soup is delicious! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The portions are pretty large, the chips/salsa was good and fresh.\n\nNow the negatives - the flavor of the food is just okay. Compared to Cantina Laredo or the now closed Agave, it's a 5 out of 10. The chicken in my enchilada was a little dry. There was too much cheese in the chile relleno. I like cheese, but it overpowered the dish. The beef taco was a bit bland.\n\nAll in all, I was satisfied after dinner, but it didn't leave me counting the days until I go back."
0,They tricked me into buying insurance even though when they offered me I turned it down. I didnt notice it on my bill either till I returned the car. These guys are sketchy RSA: Garret and MGR: Darryl.
1,"The positive: the service was fine, but slow. The decor was very warm and comfortable.\nI had heard so many good things about this place, we were dying to try it. My husband ordered a steak, my daughter got a regular cheeseburger, and I had a French dip sandwich. While my sandwich was fine, there was nothing special about it. My daughter didn't like the cheeseburger at all, and the steak looked... average... with no comment about it from my husband. My daughter thought we should have just gone to SmashBurger and I agreed that the French Dips at Arby's were better than what I had. So... a big disappointment and a bill for over $75 that could have been well-spent elsewhere. Save your money and time!"
4,I love this place!!! The breakfast is huge portions with even bigger flavor and the happy hour is a great deal! My favorite dish: Chicken Nacho's (can be eaten as a meal)!!
1,"Stopped here before a show in PH. We went here because everywhere else seemed too busy for the amount of time we had. I ordered the pulled chicken, which was dry and bland. My friends ordered the pulled pork which was up to par, and the salmon which she said was good but she says everything is good. The fries were the best part of the meal for me and along with reasonably priced beer, was the only saving point for this restaurant. Service was slow and the waitress didn't really seem to care. She apologized for taking 15 minutes to get to our table but then continued to provide mediocre service."
1,"OK I've got the inside skinny on this place and I'm gonna shoot straight.\nI've decided to edit DOWN this review as this place doesn't deserve all the BLAH BLAH I've given it.\nOn the corner of 6th and Mill in Tempe. \nPark for free at 5th and Farmer across the railroad tracks.\nMill Ave. is all metered parking now.\nI've been waiting for W.O.B. to open for ages and finally stopped in for a stiff 12oz. Oskar Blues Old Chub (8% ABV) to check out the place. With tip I think the beer was $8.59. OUCH. Kiss my ass!\n\nThe place DOES have a wide selection of good beers a beer connoiseur would expect as well as many locals, but you sure as hell pay for it. They're milking Mill Ave. for all it's worth, that's for sure, and pandering to the university crowd with HALF OFF drafts for university students, faculty and staff on Wednesdays. \nAll you public sheeple have to get a Loyalty Card or show up for happy hour for any sort of discount, which is definitely LESS than half off.\nMakes me want to get a student ID again (I graduated with a B.Sc. in the 90's, thank you very much) so I can have my ass kissed by everyone who wants my money rather than be the ass kisser of places who think they're doing me a favor by being there.\n \nW.O.B. is a sports bar with good beer and NO FOOD, but I understand they partnered with a few local places that will deliver in. The place is small and I fully expect it to be packed with university rookies when school starts. I'm not looking forward to this. I hate zoos and so do the local beer snobs.\n\nSure the place has lots of great beers but the atmosphere is cow-herdy and loud,  and you should take advantage of price breaks whenever possible or get ready to feel regretful. \nIf it's crowded, JUST WALK BACK OUT. Good luck getting a seat, and squeezing in and ordering is a royal pain.\n\n\""Nobody goes there, it's too crowded.\""  -- Yogi Berra\n\nIf you plan to go at all, go early happy hour then split when the ant farm comes in.\n\nHowever I'm glad for its presence because it's contributing to beer consciousness and the growth of the craft beer industry by showing people there's more to beer than fizzy yellow rat piss. \n\nBottom line is I won't be a regular here, I might stop in for some tap takeovers or other promo events, but I refuse to pay full price when I can drink incredible beers for much less elsewhere. No I'm not telling you where. \n\nHOWEVER there's a place that can handle ANY crowd with speed and efficiency, has plenty of seating, friendly staff that has time to talk to you, has incredible beers on tap and in the fridge, AND IN-HOUSE food with pizzas to die for, and that is PAPAGO BREWING in south Scottsdale at McDowell and Scottsdale Rd in the plaza next to the Mandarin Buffet.\nHave fun  getting annoyed at W.O.B., sheeple!\nOr head to PAPAGO where they keep it real."
2,"Oh how I wanted to like this place, I love little restaurants like this, the rustic stone walls, the small tables, etc, they do have one drawback, when busy, they can get LOUD and this place gets very LOUD.\n\nService - Aloof, unknowledgeable, friendly, but overall you would probably get more professional service at your local IHOP than we did. I asked for a pronunciation on the menu, they didn't know, I asked about a product, said they were unsure what it was, and then we had to ask for the bill from a busboy after waiting and waiting for a long time. 2 Stars\n\nValue - NO, sorry this place is expensive and the food does not match the price. We split an appetizer, had two entrees and one ice tea bill was $64 and one of the entrees was simple Polenta. 2 Stars\n\nFood - Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but when you pay $30 for an entr\u00e9e you expect a really well prepared and executed entr\u00e9e. In this case I had traditional osso bucco, the shank was excellent, the marrow delicious, the risotto Milanese over-cooked and sub par. The polenta entr\u00e9e was good, but the polenta was actually very plain tasting and covered with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Salads were horrendously over-dressed and our appetizer was $13 for one sausage link and a pear and taleggio crepe, it was good, probably the best dish of the meal, but I had to marvel at the cost. 3.5 stars\n\nBottom Line: 2.5 stars."
0,Horrible. Few choices and food tastes bad. Not your money worth and don't waste your time here. Service was terrible as well.
0,"Service sooooooo poor!!!! Stopped this morning, 6/25/13. Manager looked at me, and even didn't come to window!!!!! What time they open? 5 am? Well I was there 5:10!!!!!"
2,"Paris Las Vegas does a good job of hyping a typical sports bar.  Here, they tell us, even the condiments are sensual.  At the end of the day, however, it's a sports bar in a fancy casino, so expect some gussying up of typical American food.\n\nThe menu was impressive.  Sure, they had the traditional cow burgers, but they added turkey burgers also. And salmon! And lamb! And, relegated to the bottom right corner of the menu, were some vegetable burgers that may be perfectly tasty, but who would come to a burger joint for that?\n\nI chose the lamb burger, and ordered a side dish of fat fries and waffle fries.  I'd figured they'd give me two smallish servings of each type, but no, they trotted out a full order of potatoes.  Although initially I got the petit fries with the waffle fries, the waitress realized her mistake and brought out a full order of steak fries as well.  Turns out I liked the petit fries better; they were crispy and seasoned, the steak fries were kinda bland.\n\nAs was the lamb burger, surprisingly.  I'd chosen the lamb because I thought it would have a darker flavour to it, but apparently this is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, I've got no doubt that this was one of the better lamb burgers out there.  But I've come to realize, after eating here, that I shall be keeping my lamb on its rack, and having the traditional cow in my burgers.\n\nThe condiments, by the way, are plain old condiments.  Ketchup and mustard come in the standard squeezable bottle, and the pickle was just a pickle."
4,Best frozen bar ive been to so far! Way better then fat tuesdays when it comes to prices and customer service. The bartenders are friendly and full of energy. Favorite drinks would have to be cola-freeze or purple rain mixed with pink Panther. Dont forget the 2 extra shots for $5. Alex best bartenders ever!!!
1,"I've been here a few times -- it's ok.  Convenient to my work and the happy hour prices are decent.  The house marg is ok  but kinda small and with LOTS of ice.  The happy hour bar food was ok - nothing special.\n\nThe outdoor seating (when the weather is nice) is ok - it faces a parking lot, as does most outdoor seating in AZ.  Also when the weather is accommodating, they open the bar doors to the outside which gives it a cute look / feel. \n\nOverall - it's just ok. The food is pretty basic and if i used a toaster oven for my costco chimis / flautas - it would be the same."
4,"I came here to get a dress hemmed and was very pleased with the results.  The seamstress did a great job of helping me decide what length to make the dress and was very friendly.  On top of that, the dress was ready in 2 days and only cost $15!  I will definitely be going back for all my tailoring needs."
2,"The customer service is inconsistent. If it wasn't for the massage therapist Danielle, I would have quit this place a long time ago. It is clean. It looks and feels like a place you want to go. But, I feel like some of the people in charge dont respect the customer and not always nice. Luckily they recruited decent talent - ask for Daniel."
3,"the room we got was very nice:\n-view (21st floor with a view of the strip)\n-beds (comfy, with fluffy bedding)\n-bathroom (large and decently lit)\n\nthe pool was fantastic. love the lazy river!\nthe selection of restaurants inside MGM is pretty awesome too."
1,"Poor service, ok food that's way overpriced. The main draw seems to be their giant, novelty cocktail beverages (which are over $30).\nThe server always ran off before making sure we all ordered. This happened to me and another person in my party when ordering drinks... And another time for appetizers. We had to sit a wait a long time in between ordering. We all left disappointed.\nI have been to much better Vegas restaurants and payed way less.\nNever again."
2,"I waffled back and forth between giving it no stars and then giving it five stars. I'm perplexed by this place. \n\nWent in on a Saturday evening, it was early and seating was good. My friend and I were led to a table by a stone pillar on the patio. This table, I kid you not, was probably not bigger than two feet square. I mean, SMALL. \n\nWe waited a bit for the waiter to come by, but we weren't in a big hurry. He took our drink orders and then came back with a small (seriously) basket of chips and three different salsas or dips. None of the cups were very full. They all had a different taste, but weren't anything that I wanted to devour. They just sort of sat there and managed to stave off hunger for a bit. \n\nWe ordered a side of guacamole (for $5.99) and it came out really bland. We asked someone to bring us lemons and we added that and salt to make it edible. I really hate when I have to make something taste good with additives. I prefer it to be great from the start. Very small portion also.\n\nWhen we ordered the guac we also ordered the cheese crisp. I specifically said 'for an appetizer we'd like...' We then proceeded to also order dinner since they really do give you a lot of time before they check back with you. \n\nSo, out comes the cheese crip and our dinners. We told them we wanted the cheese crisp as an appetizer before we ate and then somehow everything disappeared. By the time the cheese crisp reappeared it was greasy and cold. It was okay, but we were disappointed that it wasn't hot because the waiter was running it around the restaurant for some bizarre reason. Also, to anyone not blind you could tell the table was not about to hold more than drinks and a couple of plates and maybe the guac so I have no idea why they brought everything we ordered at once. The table held nothing. Funny thing, too, there was PLENTY of space for bigger tables. I don't know why that one was so small. Ridiculous.\n\nSo, we finally tell the waiter that we're ready for dinner (after about 15 minutes of getting our appetizer) and he hauls the plates out just as he'd taken them back. The food had a sheen to it so it was obvious that they just warmed the plates. Just rude service. Don't make a mistake then make me keep paying for it. Cold cheese crisp, warmed over food because you don't listen and take orders correctly. I was getting bent. \n\nI ordered the blue corn enchiladas with cheese and a fried egg on top. The over-easy egg was genius. It was mouth watering (for being lukewarm). My friend had a combo plate with a taco that looked good, but I was losing my appetite fast. \n\nFunny enough, the food (outside of the chips/dip/guac) was delicious. We also had drinks (I had the frozen margarita flight of four different kinds) that were out of this world so if they could get their crap together this might be a pretty fantastic place. \n\nTo end this disappointing evening there were kids running like banshees all over the place screaming like toddlers (they had to have been 9 or 10). I mean, seriously? Who doesn't hear that and put an end to it? I don't pay these prices so I have my evening ruined by people who can't control their kids. We hightailed it out of there and went to finish our evening elsewhere. \n\nI might give this another try, but honestly with the service they provide I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay to be treated like that again. Sadly."
4,"The Barrymore by far ranks up there with some of the most excellent dinning experiences I've had. After a few disappointing meals in Vegas, I decided to Yelp for a good restaurant, and immediately was drawn to the numerous glowing reviews. I was a little surprised to find the restaurant located in an older hotel (The Royal Resort) but don't let that fool you...and if you can look at it from the perspective of an experience of vintage Las Vegas, you'll actually appreciate the location. Upon entering The Barrymore, I was greeted by a warm hostess, and treated as though completely appreciated for choosing them. My waitress was equally warm, professional, attentive, and thorough. \n\nThe decor at the Barrymore is very deliberate old Las Vegas, without a hint of pretentiousness. It feels like it's a part of Las Vegas history, even though it's a fairly new restaurant. Not many restaurants pull this off well; if they are \""vintage\"", most seem blatantly contrived. Everything from the continual sea of light blue upholstery velvet, to the wood frames mirrored matrix on the walls, to the film-reel adorned suspended ceiling tile grid says authentic vintage '60's Vegas to me. Not a single dumb, framed fake photo anywhere.\n\nOk, so now the food. One word. Exquisite. Starting with the complimentary trio bread basket, which consisted of slightly toasted baguette slices, a sweeter wheat bread, and a spicy flatbread. For an appetizer, I started with the lobster Mac 'n Cheese (highly recommended), which was a perfect blend of flavor and consistency. My entr\u00e9e was one of the specials that evening, a sole dish that was spectacular. I wish I'd have inquired further about the makeup of the dish but I was too consumed with the goodness and flavor of it. Every bite was succulent and savored.\n\nChris, the attending manager, made his rounds to each table and talked for a few minutes....a very personable gent...a perfect personality fit for the restaurant. \n\nUpon leaving The Barrymore, my wallet was a little  lighter, palette extremely satisfied, and the evening wonderfully fulfilled. The only thing that would have made it better would have been to share the experience with my girlfriend, but since I was in LV at a conference, I had to unfortunately dine alone. \n\nI wish for nothing but a well deserved and long success for the staff and owners."
3,"Service was great, Food was excellent...the down side was the tables were dirty! The place only had one table in use when we arrived!"
1,"The first experience that we had there was awesome.  The second time, terrible.  We went after seeing the Lion King on the 17th.  The place was very busy, so that was nice to see.  The bartender was so completely rude, without cause.  I don't understand this, I believe they work for tips.  We will not be returning, nor will we bring any of our out of town guests there.  Makes Vegas look bad.  Really skip this place, it's a very cool view, but exceptionally rude staff."
4,"Great small brew pub! Staff was very friendly, atmosphere is great and the beer was good! Will definitely be returning many times to this new spot!"
0,"This place used to be great to go to before driving home from Las vegas to Los Angeles.  However, there appears to be a change in management style offering terrible customer service.  The massages are not that great anymore.  The women also talk to each other loudly in their native language.  Every time the door opens at the front, an annoying bright light shines into the otherwise darkly lit room.  One of the ladies does a hard sell on you when you ask for the 20 buck an hour foot massage.  She upsells you the $35 for the body and feet massage even though the foot massage I see includes some of the same massage as the $35 for the head and scalp. My friend and brother who only authorized the basic massaged appeared to frustrate her.  The scalp massage was abrasive for my brother and I.  When finished, I provided a $20 tip and asked for $5 back and to keep the rest.  not only did she demand to keep the 20 on the table but asked for an additional dollar because she massaged me for an hour.  Yeah. that was why I paid you the hourly rate for. The tip is extra and not supposed to be negotiable.  She looked at me angrily and demanded a 35% tip. Apparently they charge a low price and expect you to tip an outrageous amount to make up for it.  This place is shady and I recommend going somewhere else. I will never return. Who needs to feel that way after a massage. I felt terrible and ruined my day.  Also, they requested the tip in cash instead of on the credit card."
1,"Remember how your parents taught you that if you had nothing good to say, don't say anything at all?\n\n:|"
3,"What a cool spot - walked right in to this pavilion-esque beer haven and took a seat on one of the many stools surrounding this very large  bar. I was impressed by the large selection of taps and went with a delicious orange blossom beer (mmm!). They have several cool mugs to choose from ranging in size.  \n\nWhile we were only able to stay for one drink- the bartender was so friendly and helpful we could have chatted with him the whole night. \n\nI cannot wait to go back and try a vanilla pilsner I was eying !\n\nAlso, for all you Upstate New Yorkers they sell Dinosaur BBQ sauce - definitely different than Carolina style but super delicious!"
2,"Thai house is solid Thai food in a slightly inconvenient location.\n\nPros:\n\n-Good Thai food.  Try the green curry, pad kee mow, pad thai, thai iced tea/thai iced coffee\n-Fast service and polite staff\n-Ambiance is superb. Most other asian restaurants in the area have no thematic decor/ambient lighting/music\n-Wait staff have interesting traditional uniforms\n-Outstanding Groupon/restaurants.com deals\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Parking is a pain in that town center.\n-Certain servers have thick accents.\n-Speed is inconsistent.  Sometimes entrees come out before appetizers.\n-Easy to rack up a big bill here.  Bills are comparable to Basil in uptown... but this area is University."
2,first spot of the night \n\nstayed over at the Tropicana Hampton across the street from here already had a buzz going... as we walked through the parking lot I started noticing big trucker looking type guys...  some were walking with overalls and no shirts... started thinking what the?? but its Vegas..no problem..\n\n once inside a lot of security with guns!! not good... oh well who cares can do... \n\nsat down at the penny slots waited and waited for some drink service and nothing it was a while before we got drinks.... \n\nhowever the big plus of the night I started with $5 bucks came out winning $150 on just the penny slots!!! dont care who you are when it comes to winning places seem to get better... \n\nafter reading some reviews the next day and seeing this place in the morning its a truck stop!! that explained alot...and apparently its a locals place  \n\nstill I would come back don't know about the rooms some reviews fair this place OK
3,"I used to love Tokyo Lobby....but lately not so much. So I was in search of a new west side (what! what!) sushi spot.\n\nIn the Fry's shopping center. Much nicer on the inside than on the outside. Pretty large inside.\n\nHad a selection of rolls and all were really fresh. Good flavors. No sick mayo mixture (that other places use to cover up bad sushi). Small pieces (which I like).  Rolls were 4.50 to 8$ (for the \""normal\"" rolls) and specialty rolls up to 10$.\n\nOverall a west side win!   I will be going back."
4,"I've been to Whole Pet almost every week in the past month due to my cat's pancreatitis and diabetic relapse. No fun but Whole Pet has really lessened the stress by being so kind and flexible. Taz, being the sweet, incredibly chill cat he is, has a bit of a fan club after so much time there. Whenever I call, the receptionists are genuinely excited to hear how he's doing and they've been excellent about working with my not-very-forgiving schedule for blood glucose checks and the like. Just had to give another rave, Whole Pet! The skills of the doctors here are matched by the level of service from everyone on staff and it's much appreciated."
2,"A little pricey  for the best tasting pizza.  Happy Hour specials are good, and it makes for a great place to snack after leaving the bars :)"
0,"This review is about a year and a half late. Only until I saw her today on yelp is when I thought, \""I need to let these women know what MY experience was\"". My initial interaction with Sean wasn't the best. I called her expecting to set up an appointment  only to receive a less than \""warm\"" reception from her. Sean was rude, irritated and short. She basically told me (paraphrasing) that I needed to pay her up front by depositing the money in her account. Hmm! Ok! I immediately went to Wells Fargo, deposited the money so she would at LEAST take me seriously. After I made the deposit she explained to me that recently she had been setting appointments for people who didn't show. Odd, but ok! I need my hair done! She makes the appointment, assures me that she ll be ready 6am and it will take her 8-10 hours. I wake up at the crack of dawn to only knock on the door to NOTHING. Nobody comes to the door! I call her, NOTHING. I hated to bang on the door but, I drove 25minutes away from my house, at 5:30am! Finally, a smaller version of her came to the door. It was her gorgeous daughter! She was so sweet. She apologized and said her mom was still sleep. She tried to make me as comfortable as she could. Sean came down 20 minutes later explaining that she was up all night doing hair. Before she started, I told her that I wanted my micro braids to NOT be cut. I don't want them all being the same length (personal preference).She told me ok, and got started. After about every 2 hours, she would call her daughter to cut the \""fly away\"" hairs off the braids (to make them neater) and flat iron the hair (which was odd again. Who flat irons synthetic hair? )while she laid on the couch and tried to get 10 minutes of sleep. Fine by me until I felt my braids get a lot lighter. She CUT MY BRAIDS! The very THING that I didn't want. I couldn't even be mad at her daughter though. I immediately said \""Oh nooo!\"" Her mom woke up and said \""She didn't want her braids cut!!\"". I'm thinking, \""Why are you yelling at your daughter, when it's YOUR fault?\"" Her daughter wasn't around when I told her that I didn't want them cut!  So, now I'm just sitting there frustrated. Then as Sean is braiding, I'm noticing that she's braiding down only midway. Meaning, I still have my REAL hair sticking out of the synthetic hair? WTF? I asked her \""you're not going to braid it all the way down\"" She told me no. I paid her EXTRA $$$ because my hair is longer, and I have a big head. I'm used to paying a little bit more. Only to not get my hair ALL THE WAY BRAIDED! So now, I have cut braids with my hair sticking out the braid. No wonder she says you can't get the braids wet! I get braids SO that I'll be able to get my hair wet! The conclusion was, I had small braids with the bottom of them being BIG AND POOFY. She KNEW I wasn't happy as she asked to take a picture of it and saw my face. Her response? \""Smile, you'll get used to it\"". It took me a WEEK to braid those braids all the way down. Of course she posted my picture on her fb page. I like to actually get my hair braided for convenience. Not a week of inconvenience!"
4,"We attended this month's third Friday N+U event (free) at the Heard and it was a blast! This month, it was Capoeira and African drumming/dancing with an open bar and margaritas/street tacos in the cafe. The event was entertaining, full of energy and my 3 year old and I danced for almost an hour. My margaritas certainly didn't hurt! I had a great time and I am really looking forward to September's event, jewelry and drinks!"
2,"My father in law took us out to eat here on a Saturday night around 7pm and it was really packed-we had a 30 minute wait. The ambience and set up of this place is really nice with a casual setting. After being seated our waitress came right out and took our order. The have a large wine selection on the back of their menu and a few beers. I thought it was weird that they didn't have bread sticks or cheese bread or any other appetizers  to order besides salads and calzones.  We ordered the house salad large which was more than enough for four of us. The pizza came out next and it was really greasy but tasted pretty good. The ingredients on the pizza tasted fresh. The large pizza was enough for four of us to have two slices. My daughter and I were also a little disappointed because they didn't carry ranch dressing. This place was pretty good, not the best--but pretty good."
1,I'm torn cause the good was as good as the one in Town Square but the service was mediocre at best. I know they just opened and there's growing pains but this is why there's training before you open. I'll be back big if they fuck it up next time I'll drive all the way over to Town Square.
1,ummm greasy food heavy cream makes for a not so fab body to lay out near the pool.  french food buffet style just isnt a good idea.  definitely not as good as the Bellagio buffet and variety and space is lacking as well.
1,"Paid $100 bucks for a one night stay.  The full sized beds were TINY.  Two grown people most definitely do NOT sleep or fit comfortably!!  Breakfast was decent. They offer waffles, cereal, juices & milk, some fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels or bread for toasting.   The pool was nice as well as the pool area itself.  The location is pretty centralized to a ton of restaurants, sports complex, and shopping."
1,"This place didn't live up to the rave reviews. Went there this weekend for a quick pizza. First off I'd like to say that the staff was very attentive and the owner himself came over to say hello. It turns out that his family goes to the same church we do. \nThe server was very attentive and asked how our meal was and also refilled our soft drinks so the service was not the issue, the food just didn't live up to the expectations we had due to the rave reviews our friends had for the place. It was very disappointing. The pizza had no taste and the crust was burnt on the bottom and it didn't taste like it had baked all the way through. We will try again because maybe the chef had a bad night. This was not a good impression at all."
4,"This place is the cleanest Asian-grocery in the East Valley.  It's mostly Korean food items with some Chinese and Japanese stuff thrown in the mix.  \nYou CANNOT beat the meat section; they specialize in Korean and Asian-cuts you cannot find anywhere else.  This is because they will cut anything for you fresh on the spot.  L.A. Galbi (Ribs), Wang Galbi, Sam GyupSal (Pork Belly), and more all cut to your liking.  \nThey also have a Korean snack-bar/food stand where they specialize in Korean fast food.  I've tried their Kimbap (Korean roll similar to sushi but nothing raw) and DdukBokkee (Sweet Rice sticks in spicy sauce), and it's really really good.  \nOh, and they have a relationship with the Liquor store that's in the same plaza where they sell Soju (Korean rice wine)!!!!!!!!!!\nFresh or marinated meats, fresh vegetables, and Soju!?!?!?!  Time for a Korean bbq!"
0,Drive thru SUCKS here!!!! This is the 3rd time they messed up my order and there sooooo freakin slow! They have no since of urgency.

1,"I received a facial for a birthday gift and I loved the woman, Ebony, who provided this service.  I would recommend her to anyone.\n\nMy issue was with the odd juxtaposition of the relaxation/day spa branding with uptight corporate energy.  On the hour, the clients file in and out like clockwork.  Which I can appreciate, being a service person myself.  But the sales pitch at the end was such a buzzkill.  As much as I loved Ebony I likely would never return on my own because there's no point in going to de-stress if you're going to be stressed out by the person at the front desk, negating the effect of the entire service you just purchased.\n\nI'm also still trying to figure out why a place that is supposed to be nurturing self-care and relaxation was selling Red Bull to its customers in the waiting area. :)\n\nIf you're going to make self-care and nurturing your product, it has to be woven through the entire business model, not just be the premise.  If I want hard sell, I can go to my gym or join a direct marketing supplement scam.  If I go to a day spa, relaxation is my goal.  Please let that be my service."
0,"I went in tonight for some fast dinner. Big mistake! First off, the place is very dirty and smells as though they haven't changed the grease in a long time, judging by the teenagers behind the counter, my guess is that it is lack of knowledge. Second, they were very rude and unprofessional. But I was hungry so I soldiered on. Then I got home only to open up what I thought was a joke! It wasn't.. The boneless wings are actually nuggets, and at 1.00 a piece, I felt very short changed. Then the over whelming smell of fish( in my wings box) hit my nose. I couldn't even bring myself to try them. This place should and probably will be closed very shortly. What a horrible experience and waste of $10.00. I highly recommend you drive the extra 2 miles south to Buffalo Wild Wings and get what you pay for at least. As a hard working mother of 4, I would highly recommend spending your money somewhere else. Very disappointed.. And hungry."
1,"Ive been going to Randy's for years, ever since they were at the old place which is now a Safeway.   Needless to say I've had just about everything on their menu. Randy's used to be a reasonably priced restraunt with great food, but it has slowly turned into an over priced restraunt with smaller and smaller portions.  Breakfast is still a pretty good buy, but lunch and dinner are simply not.  I just came from Randy's and had the buffalo chicken salad like I have so many other times.  The salad was $8 and looked like an oversized side salad.  I have noticed this very same thing on many of there other meals.  I ve probably have had my last dinner at Randy's tonight but I may make another breakfast trip.  To end on a good note the servers are usually the best!"
3,one of the better places in madison. great beer selection. burger and onion rings were good
4,"I love coming here so much. I come about once a month just for the grilled cheese & tomato bisque. It's divine...\nEveryone is kind but not overly. I am here solo today but it's okay, the atmosphere & the bar is quite comfortable for a single patron.\n\nI haven't found a Yardhouse I don't love!"
2,"This is a great place if you just want an indoor activity during a hot day.  I would recommend buying your tickets in advance online.  They often offer discounts.  The admission otherwise is a little outrageous given the size of this aquarium.  The displays are well done, and there is a point that the kids can touch starfish.  My kids loved watching the stingrays during feeding time, and they really liked watching the spongebob movie they offered.  They have a great tank of \""Nemo\"" and \""Dori\"" fish as my kids like to call them.  It was a pretty good time.  One really convenient thing about the location of this aquarium is the Rainforest Cafe that is in the same mall.  You can really make a day out of going to the aquarium and then the cafe for lunch."
4,"This is one of the best buildings in Montreal!!!!\n\n 4 swimming pools, spa, sauna, steam room, rooftop terrace and game room.\n\nI would disregard Eli W.'s review because I think he made an error, it is not a commercial building but a private residential one so there is no administration or rental office so it makes no sense\n\nhttps://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/1594063"
4,My wife loves this place. Anna is great!
4,I loved the cake--and the quiche--and the soups (French onion was great!)--and the friendly personal service--and the rubber stamp store next door!  Hope to see them again soon!
0,Don't waste your money!! Service is friendly but sushi has much to be aspired for....we should have known considering we were the only people there!!
4,"A great haircut, and always a fun time!!  Bella and Frank can do a flat top to rival Pete's in Austin (I miss Frank).  These folks there are like extended family.   A-1+  in all categories."
1,I've always enjoyed NAPA. They seem to be trying hard to get folks in the front door with all the ads on TV these days. Sorry to say once you go to this location you don't feel welcomed. First I stopped in on a Sunday and the NAPA guy complained about having to work. The pace of their work is beyond slow. They did not have the parts I needed but he said he could have them there by the afternoon. When I stopped back and received the parts I noticed one of them did not look to be correct. The NAPA guy insisted it was the correct part. Well sure enough it was for the wrong transmission all together. I dropped of the part today and again they are soooo slowwww. I'm not sure how a business can run at that pace. I will not be back. There are so many options for parts these days.
3,"Love this place! Such fun bartenders, Jake is my favorite he's a ball buster!! So funny, good times!  The American food and Chinese food menus are great, one of the few places in Vegas with actually great Chinese food. pizzas are great on the American menu. This place is a staple in our menu of outings/bars/restaurants. Free wifi too! :) enjoy!"
2,"While I was at a conference at Mandalay Bay last month, I made a reservation on Open Table for Aureole.\n\nFor several hours while taking notes and watching PowerPoint slides, I was thinking about all the yummy treats I would be having while watching the wine fairy flitter to the next wine selection.\n\nI arrived. I checked in. I was seated. While the dining room looked beautiful, I knew I would be more comfortable in the casual and friendly wine bar.  Several of my friends joined me and we enjoyed the festive and fun atmosphere.\n\nThe food was good ... but not the best I have had here in the past.  Their happy hour choices were not easy to share for a group.  \n\nWhat made me give them 3 stars today, when I would usually give them 5, is that they cancelled my open table reservation and made it look like I was a no show ... when in fact, I brought six people to their restaurant.  Boo!  That was not very nice!"
1,"I went to this place with some co-workers during Wednesday lunch hour.  I ordered the Thai Chicken on whole wheat regular crust.  \n\nThe ingredients, sliced carrots and bean sprouts, while fresh kept falling off because it was just sprinkled on the top.  Overall, I finished it, but something about the sweet paste didnn't really match what you'd expect on a pizza.  I am just used to having salty pizzas.\n\nThe waitress was not attentive and did not refill my iced tea.  Not until we were leaving did she offer to fill it with water when I was just chewing the ice because I was just so thirsty."
3,"This was our daily stop to pick up sandwiches, ice and other fun stuff before heading out to Lake Mead. They have some really cheap and delicious pre-made sandwiches, we ate those most days on the lake, but we also tried their fried chicken which was actually pretty good. I remember getting fried chicken from Albertsons growing up and I guess this was way. Cheap and tasty.\n\nI really had the taste for sushi the week leading up to the trip and I saw they actually had Unagi in their sushi section that I saw the \""chef\"" making on the spot daily. However $8 for sushi from a grocery store just wasn't appealing. Maybe if it were a little cheaper.\n\nThey have a decent liquor and beer selection. Their prices weren't too bad, but nowhere near that of a larger liquor warehouse.\n\nThe store itself was clean, bright and pretty big. They also had some an Angry Birds claw game full of Angry Birds plushes.\n\nI'd definitely shop here if I lived in the area and will likely be back next year when we come back to Lake Mead."
1,"Location: Excellent - in the heart of downtown.\n\nSelection: Excellent - they have a wide selection of clothing suited to various activities, as well as sunglasses, cycling gear etc. \n\nService: What service? No one will greet you or come up to you to see if you need anything. You have to seek out someone to access the change rooms, and the clerks don't bother checking in with you to see if you need another size.  As well, I was looking for specific shoes, which they had - but I had to wait aout 5+ minutes while the one clerk on the floor (it was lunch hour - come on!) chatted away with a couple. He saw me, but ignored me so he could continue his conversation. Professional? I think not. They didn't have the shoes in my size, and the clerk was perfectly happy to send me on my way without offering to do a stock check to see if another store had them, nor did he suggest another shoe from the selection that they did have. Fail."
1,"My family and I have been a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay for a very long time!  We were so excited to finally get a chance to eat at one of his restaurants.  Our son who is 11 was extremely sad to know he was not able to join us as he too is a huge fan of Gordon's! I do not think we will tarnish his opinion by telling him about our experience:(.  We were there Monday September 9, 2013.  The whole experience was over priced, undercooked and bland.  I read someone review from the same night that had over seasoned food, sorry I almost wish that happened to us!\n\nI actually wanted to eat from the Hells Kitchen tasting menu but was told NO unless everyone at the table ordered it.  The problem was that we were there with friends that do not eat meat.  Sadly I was not able to order what I wanted. As we were also told that we could only order the wellington medium and not well done.\n\nNext we were told the wild pacific salmon was actually farm raised and not wild.\n\nOur drink orders were fine.\n\nApps were mixed, my onion soup was average, gnocchi was sad and under seasoned, the pea soup was okay, and the Seared Foie Gras was not seared well and under seasoned:(.\n\nMoving on to Entrees...  Our Friends both had seafood and pork.  The chops were underwhelming and my friend had better at Delmonico's.  The fishermans grill was tasty but worth half what she received.  As for my husband and myself we were sad about the experience with both the Beef Wellington which was soggy and extremely rare.  We were told we could not order it well, and all of them came out medium.  My husbands plate was bloody and unappealing to look at.  A huge MISS!  I actually ordered the pork belly which tasted okay but bland and was full of fat.  I mean loads of fat, even for the small portion I received.  The portions and the price may have been worth it had our food of been seasoned and cooked.  My husband and I joked that if Gordon were actually eating this meal he would have been disgusted and thrown it all in the trash.  We also had sides of: mac n cheese (again very bland and over cooked), Haricot Vert which was okay, Roasted heirloom carrots, okay, creamed spinach was good but same as you could get anywhere.\n\nOur table was too small for the four of us and our wait staff did not seem happy to be there.  While they had smiles on their faces they were not familiar with the menu and unable to answer many questions.  Maybe they were annoyed because we were foodies and asked a lot of questions! I just do not know.  The actual assistant buser to our waiter was friendly but again not very knowledgeable.  \n\nThe ONLY thing we had that was worth going there was the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING!!!  Best Thing I have EVER TASTED!!!  I wish I had order only that!  As I would have been completely satisfied and had no need to be disappointed by the $500 plus we spent on the remainder of the food.  Overall I am glad we went, but so disappointed I cannot imagine ever going to one of his restaurants again unless he is there.  Crazy enough we were told he had been there two days before we were.  I wish I knew before we made the reservations for Monday."
3,"A relaxing place with some good lookin' Bunnies.\n\nLots of sitting areas with massive windows with views of the strip. The Playboy Bunnies are all over the place and who can write anything about that?\n\nGood: Lots of comfy, soft seats.\n\nBad: Gambling here is a little pricey.\n\nFinal: Relax with some Bunnies."
1,"I think this Mexican restaurant/sports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. \n\nWhen I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the immediate bar/room to the right of the entrance. If I remember accurately, there were about 3 TVs at the bar in there. The crowd here is a little bit older, but everyone looked like they were there to have a great time - MILFs, DILFs, and cougars included. \n\nI went up to the host stand where I waited for almost 5 minutes. Many servers walked by, but no one bothered to help, or tell me someone was on their way to seat me. Once I did sit down, I waited for about 15 minutes for my friend without being greeted by a server. Once she arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before my friend went to grab a waitress. The waitress apologized and told us she didn't realize she had our table as well. I've worked in a few restaurants through college - long enough to know that things sometimes get mixed up, but when you have a table waiting without food our drinks for 30+ minutes, you should probably go ask them if they need any help! \n\nThe food isn't worth talking about, so I won't."
0,"The $20 \""deal\"" for 2 hours of open bar and entry into the pool was a total scam.  Long line at one drink stand with 1 bartender, plus $50 to get a chair (which should be standard and free), and the music is terrible and too loud.  Staff was not friendly...borderline rude.  Whatever, save your time and money."
4,"Room 112 has quickly become one of my Top 5 places in Charlotte and a clear Number 1 in the Sushi category.  We tend to go there at least 4 times/month.\n\nThe typical order for my wife and I is:  1 bottle of Sean Minor Pinor Nior, 2 orders of the Spicy Tuna Nigiri (equals 4 pieces), 1 Pink Floyd Roll,  and then we pick a different random roll each time.  Sometimes we'll grab a Volcano Roll but substitute the California beneath it with something different, most often a Crunchy California.\n\nWe try to ask for Brandon each time... takes excellent care of us!  I've been wanting to try other dishes but it's hard to stray from such a great trend we've started.  Room 112 has quickly become the clear Sushi favorite for us in Charlotte and even when we sample some national favorites like Oishii in Boston, we find ourselves still preferring the sushi at 112.\n\nUpdate:   We now order the K5 (named after my wife and I).  I think if you guys start ordering they'll have to add it to the menu.  Brandon will know what you are talking about!  (has Tempura Shrimp, Avacado, Jalapeno Slice, and more... You'll Love.)"
0,"This review is solely for Boston Cream.\n\nThis is my favorite flavor at other establishments. I really like the donut, the pie, just everything. However, this flavor? Total let down. It was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor. Making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it Boston Cream. The effort was there but the execution was sad."
1,Nice store. The lady who took my order was having a lot of conversation with her fellow employees as opposed to listening to the order.  All the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  My wife doesn't like to bring food home because she would rather enjoy right after being made. We wont eat in again because we had to listen to the staff gossip and eat at a dirty table.  Food was consistent with other subways but run by children.
1,"Ok. We were just here for the food. Just the food. LOL. My friends and I were hungry after we landed --- load and behold --- there were a Hooters (and the casino!). Wings were wings. I had the burger called an \""Elvis\"". The bbq sauce in the burger made me want to vomit. Oh. skip the local beer on tap. I forgot what it was called, but it tasted sweet. Sweet and beer is not a good combo."
0,"$12 for a half-sized weak margarita?!! Went after work to enjoy happy hour with co-workers and was VERY disppointed. When I asked the server about the pricing, (beause the menu had no prices and the happy hour section was a little confusing) she could of cared less. She wasn't very friendly or had any kind of personality."
0,"Ordered catering from here and they were utterly confused when I arrived about the order. To make things worse they then ignored me for 30 minutes until I asked again about it. Utter customer service failure, regardless of food. Better options exist."
2,its a typical Filipino Grill...
2,"Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. \n\nI went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. \n\nWe ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a \""sampler\"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. \n\nThe sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. \n\nFor our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! \n\nNo biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. \n\nI do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). \n\nThe beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. \n\nService was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.\n\nI ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. \n\nTo steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: \""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty\""!  \n\nNote* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.\n\nWould I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at."
4,"More posh than Posh, Capital Grille is the stuffy resturant that will totally get you laid. lol..., the food is good, the service is TOP notch. I cannot even begin to tell you!! ARGH! I'm getting ahead of myself... *deep breath* Let me begin...\n\nIt was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)\n\nWe entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love. \n\nWe had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.  \n\nOne slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.\n\nIf you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time! Just call ahead for reservations!"
2,One time visitors from out of town on a Saturday night.  Good crowd of regulars.  Not pretentious or touristy as the Scottsdale Rd bars; more of a working Joe & Josephine's bar.  Reasonable prices.  Karaoke was fun.  Had NTN trivia.  UFC on plenty of screens.  Outdoor patio featuring bands on certain nights.  Only complaint was the waitress did seem to pass by many times when the beer mugs were low or empty.
2,"Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite.  It's a charming place, with food beautifully displayed and a friendly, welcoming staff.  There's a nice patio in the rear, and the back room with the couches is charming.  Good coffee and tea, the scone was dry and tasty as sawdust, and the almond croissant certainly looked much tastier than it tasted.  They have a nice-looking menu, though, so I might drop in if I am back through the area, but I certainly would not make it a point to revisit."
1,"The girls and I decided to try this place out after having a few drinks at the W one Friday night. We all heard great things and I think I was the only one that hadn't eaten here yet. It was crazy busy and we waited about 20 min. or so for a table, the bar was even packed so we hung outside in chairs near the front entrance. I decide to go for the burger and fries and my friend decides to go for some sort of fish dish and my other friend settled for the apple monkey bread. My burger was big but very bland and the fries were standard, I could have gone to In-n-out and saved some money. My friend's fish and veggies were undercooked and the server insisted that was one of their best dishes at the restaurant....really O_o...after sending it back one of the manager's did come out and say that the food was undercooked and took it off the bill and offered to make her something else but my friend declined. The best thing about the meal was my friend's apple monkey bread, I could have eaten tons of that stuff! \n\nOur server was extremely slow the entire time we were there and it took her almost 20 min. to bring our check after we requested it...we were 10 sec. away from complaining to the manager. \n\nFirst impressions are everything so I am very hesitant about trying this place out again...we shall see."
3,"Love having a farmer's market close-by.\nMy husband and I are big fans of One Windmill Farms and their selection of fresh produce. It is quite busy on Saturday mornings and the hustle and bustle creates a wonderful community feel.\nI am taking off one star because, sadly, the owners suddenly decided to close both the adjacent Phoenix Public Market store, which used to be open 6 days a week, and the Royal Coffee Bar. This is truly a travesty, and I will sorely miss the presence of both places in downtown Phoenix."
2,"I love the bagels, but almost every time we've gone in, they've had a limited selection of bagels available. They've also been super busy every time I've gone in, which probably explains the lack of bagels. I've never had an issue with the service, like others have mentioned. My only problem is that they've been out of cinnamon sugar bagel every time I've been in lately- and I love that bagel!"
1,"Been here twice! Our first experience was beyond terrible. Servers and hostess's were bad! First time, the server never showed up to offer us any drinks etc, we were waiting for over 20 minutes. We left. It's really nice inside. But the service and food is just all around bad. Tried the tacos, $5.00 for a dam taco? Have had way better tacos than that. The chicken taco was drenched in fat, the only one that was semi-good was the adovada taco? I think. The salsa was delish! I'm a salsa freak, so I would know.  The rice was gross and the beans?? Don't even get me started on that. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being yummy, I say their food is a 3!! Overall, too expensive, bad service and \""blah\"" food."
0,"Our office had received Napoli's menu in the mail and were exited to try some of the lunch specials located on the back of the menu. We set a date to order for the office the week following receiving the flyer in the mail. We ordered 2 lunch specials, both priced at $6.99 on the menu. I was made to repeat the order several times to the lady on the phone (who was not particularly nice). I was then given a price which seamed a little higher than i had anticipated for 2 lunch orders. Upon verification of the prices, she explained that the lunch specials that i had ordered were $7.99. i explained that i had just received this menu circular in the mail the previous week. She stated that she would provide our office with a new menu and then went on to tell me that the order would be delivered in an hour, which was perfect since our lunch break would be at that exact time of delivery. (ordered at 11:32). I decided not to haggle with the pricing and left it alone since i understand pricing does change without notice.\n\nA little over an hour later and 5 minutes into our lunch break, our food had still not arrived. I called back and spoke with the same lady who had taken our order. Before checking on our order status she started to brush me off by stating that it takes an hour for delivery. I stopped her and explained that it had been that long already and explained that me and my coworker are allowed a limited amount of time for or lunch. She then huffed and stated she would look to see when our order was placed to make sure it had actually been an hour. After verifying that , yes, it had indeed been OVER an hour she began to check on the order status and explained that it may be about 7 minutes more before we would receive our order. \n\nI spoke with my co-worker who agreed with me that this was way more trouble than it was worth, not to mention by the time our food would arrive (given it would arrive in \""7 minutes\"") we would then only be left with 10 minutes to eat. I called back and then spoke with a gentleman (may have been in some sort of manager). I began to explain the situation with the menu pricing, he interrupted me and stated he would give me 5 dollars off my order. I explained to him that at this point we would just like to cancel our order and i did not feel that $5 would justify such bad service. He did not seem to care either way at the loss of a customer and hung up. I later noticed on the menu they advertise \""Fast Delivery\"", yeah that's a complete joke!"
1,"\""How much did you spend?\""\n\n\""Twenty-something.\""\n\n\""We should have went to Chipotle.\""\n\nIf that exchange does not give any indication of our view, I will just type it out.  They are good, but they are a bit overpriced, and their food lacked that punch.  It does not help there are better restaurants in the vicinity.  \n\nThe stew tasted like baked beans, the smothered BBQ chicken sandwich was bland, the Shaniac was okay, but it was very messy, and the sweeten tea was almost like straight sugar. So, that requires unsweetened to dilute it.  \n\nThe better options in the area will not allow me to make a repeat visit.  I am not heart broken by it.\n\n~David"
1,"Right when i walked in The carpet smelled like old rag and it makes you want to throw up also the dance floor is super small \n\nMy friend ,not drunk at all, wanted to play with the water near the pool and the security showed us where the restroom was...lied and brought us to the exit saying she can't be in their club because she was too drunk which I have to emphasize that she was NOT which made the guys who came with waste their $30-40\n\nThe alcohol was not strong at all.., once the ice melted it felt like I was drinking cranberry juice or watered down soda \n\nBut anyways they had open bar for girls so I guess it made it up even though guys had to pay for weak alcohol\n\nThe go go dancer or pole dancer was great though she went all the way up towards the ceiling hanging upside down with her legs probably the best thing that happened that night +1 star for the dancer :)"
4,"I love this place. At first I was put off by the communal table concept but after talking to the patrons around us and talking about the different menu items (and even sharing our tempura green beans) I realized how genius it is. I highly recommend the chicken thighs, tempura green beans (the sweet cream cheese pepper jelly is amazing), and baked mac and cheese! I can't wait to return and try more of the menu, especially the desserts! What a great addition this is to downtown!"
1,"I don't see the big deal.  It's a greasy spoon.  The Maximilian's a skillet.  It's all fine, but I don't understand the high praise.  It's nice that it's an oasis of family-owned in Tempe, which is a sea of chains... but still.  Gotta say I enjoyed my breakfast at Essence Bakery & Cafe way more. Yeah, I guess they're entirely different animals, and maybe part of it is really is a matter of preference.  But even though on that basis, I'd like to give one more star, I just can't because of the same deal with the service I've been running into all over this town:  college kids that make no bones about the fact they'd rather be somewhere else."
2,"Went here in recommendation from a fam member. For starters the service was good. The server was friendly, cordial and prompt with our order. I wasnt too pleased with the food."
4,From the moment that I called their office Kristen was very knowledgable and took the time to troubleshoot our issue. Our the field rep had great follow-up and was genuinely concerned to solve our critter problem. He even told us when we didn't need to pursue a project that another rodent advisor tried to steer us towards. Thanks for your honesty. We will continue to give your company our business!
3,"3.5 stars\n\nI can't decide how I feel about this place.  I can see why people wouldn't like it.  It's really small and there's no where to go besides the pool if you don't have a day bed or lounge chair.  You can't really lay your towel on the edge of the pool or anything. \n\nIt's pretty chill, which I liked, but it also doesn't really feel like a pool party.  I liked that, but people who want a crazy party probably shouldn't come here. \n\nWe got a free daybed so cheers to that.  We had a good time despite all these problems. Oh and the waitresses have cool monokinis?\n\nIf I had to pay though, I probably would just go to the Palazzo pool because it wasn't that different.  The Palazzo pool is bigger and has free lounge chairs after all."
4,"My husband and I ate here last night for our \""date night,\"" and we have no regrets choosing The Haymaker! I got the BLAT sandwich, (which was delicious, by the way) and he got the ribs/chicken plate (I can't remember the name on the menu, but it was also VERY good!) His came with baked mac'n'cheese and mine with sweet potato fries. We were 100% satisfied with our food, and after ordering the bread pudding for dessert we were stuffed to the brim. It was great food for a great price, and we definitely plan on returning!"
3,"I've been here a couple of times for lunch and for dinner. The food has always been good, the service has been really good. It is a bit spendy for what you get and the interior is a little over the top, but I've been there three times so far so that hasn't stopped me."
3,"My sister introduced me to Ted, and while I am not a good fit for his clothes, my Stephen is.  Its not a cheap store, about $148 for a short sleeved button down shirt, but the fabric is so nice, and the designs are very european.  \n\nI AM Disappointed that they didn't have any TedTini cocktails.  I specifially asked the sales guy can I have a cocktail (or water) and he replied they didn't have any.  \n\nREALLY??? Are you sure?  I told him \""I'm very thirsty\"" and just spent $500 on 3 shirts.\n\nNADA! The guy said they only offer cocktails when there's a special event.  Hmmm, reading older yelp reveiws, I wonder if they stopped offering drinks, or  its just this location?  \n\nReally?  I'm disappointed, because other Ted locations offer beer, cocktails, and drinks... \n\nI do like this location because its bright and airy, and in the more quiet part of the Forum Shops.  Its brighter than South Coast Plaza (which is TOO dark) and there's plenty of dressing rooms and the sales staff is friendly."
2,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.
0,"This is the worst pizza I've ever had. We had our children with us, so we kept it safe with a large cheese pizza and the wedge salad. \n\nLet me start with the salad. Wedge salad with bleu cheese and apple-wood smoked bacon. The ranch tasted like a gross bottled on the shelf kind of ranch. The bacon was chewy and soft and the bleu cheese was mediocre. I do have to say the large at $16 would be enough to feed at least 6 adults. \n\nAs for the pizza, I know we didn't get any gourmet specialty pizzas or toppings but any place should be able to have an outstanding cheese pizza, I mean I thought this place since they are \""gourmet\"" and all should be able to knock a cheese pizza out of the park!!! Was I ever wrong, the crust tasted bland, I mean it absolutely had NO FLAVOR at all. The sauce was sweet, some people like that, but I'm more of a savory pizza sauce type of gal. And the cheese... so disappointing! The cheese should've been amazing!! But it tasted like really, extremely, old Parmesan... the worst part of it, this 12\"" pizza cost $15.50 for just some plain ol' cheese on it. I would recommend Peter Piper Pizza over this place any day of the week."
2,Found this place by accident and decided to give it a shot. Great place with great staff. We will be back for sure but the downside..NO MILITARY DISCOUNT!!
4,"Disclaimer: I am by no means a steak expert or a fine dining expert. I am a regular every day person who enjoys good food in a good environment with good service. I expect to receive a good experience based on what I pay. My credentials have no culinary background and I cook at home probably 3-4 times per week depending on how busy my work schedule gets.\n\nThat being said, I had an amazing time a CUT.\n\nFood (5 Stars): There are a variety of steaks to choose from and the most expensive being the Wagyu beef, an amazing marbled piece of beef with fat infused in that allows the meat to melt in your mouth. I ordered the Rib-Eye wagyu beef which was a full 8-9 ounces of beef. Our group also ordered the sides that you can share: Creamed spinach, white asparagus, Japanese mushrooms, and potato fingerlings. All of these side orders were amazing. My favorite had to be the creamed spinach with the sunnyside egg on top. It complimented the steak well and I could've had more of it.\n\nHere comes the steak: a juicy succulent piece of steak charred and cooked to perfection! About half way through the steak, my friend said \""It's so rich that I feel nauseous.\"" It was so good and for those of us who have not been able to experience really good food on a regular basis, it can definitely be overwhelming. I would eat this steak again and again and again. I felt really full afterwards, but not sick to my stomach. It was majorly satisfying.\n\nService (5 Stars): The waiter were great. They brought out cheese bread sticks, foccacia onion bread, and the pretzel bread that all went well with a great piece of cheese. They also joked around with us because I have this obsession with mayonaise. Overall, a friendly group that waited on us very well. They even included a little mini dessert for us which included a mini macaroon and chocolate bar. \n\nBottom Line: It's a hefty price for fine dining, but it was worth it for the food and experience!"
0,"Super shuttle can rot in hell. I made an online reservation, pre-paid and was super psyched about the great $14 rate that would get me to my hotel. my plane came in early, but i had to wait for my bags at baggage claim so i was about 10 minutes late for my 9:35PM pickup.  \n\nI go outside and am directed to the super shuttle dispatcher guy who i walk up to.  he half turns towards me but refuses eye contact as they are glued to the company cell phone that is scrolling something on the screen.  \""hi i have a reservation, my name is erin...\"" he takes a deep breath and asks again how i spell my last name and says \""yeah yeah 5 minutes\"" and promptly walks away from me. \n\nnow my name is generally difficult for people to spell, and i didn't get the sense he'd actually been listening, but i moved aside and took the opportunity to stretch my legs. a van pulls up about five minutes later. driver gets out, says one man's name, the man gets on and they drive away.  another van pulls up. i ask the guy if it's the one i'm supposed to get on and he puts his hand up to indicate i should stop talking. umm okay. \n\nso now it's 10:20 (!!!!) and that dude goes on break when his coworker comes back. his coworker who just smoked an entire blunt.  more vans are coming and going, yelling out street names and people just hop on. well i don't frigging know what street my hotel is near wtf?!  at 10:30 i approach the stoner and ask him when my shuttle is arriving.  his first question: \""did the other guy help you?\"" i can sense that if i say yes he will immediately walk away. i say no. he looks up my reservation and oh magical, no one called it in when i got to the stand 40 minutes ago. wow. spectacular. so i tell him the other guy told me five minutes, and that i have a reservation and he goes \""there are no reservations and i thought you said no one helped you\"".\n\nAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!! after he tells me i will have to wait an ADDITIONAL 45 MINUTES i call the 800 number to have a screaming fit, and that dude calls the stoner and asks him what's up and the stoner says i'm annoying and then i am told yet again that there are no reservations.  no reservations? i ask. why did i get a confirmation, pick up time schedule and pre-pay online then? hmmmm?? no response to that but after a brief hold i'm told i can get on a bus in 15 minutes.  \n\ni got to my hotel at 11PM. sure it's a $14 ride, but that's not right."
0,"You get in line at this place, and with the line only 4 people, expect to wait 30+ minutes, as they take FOREVER to just get one person through.\n\nThen after you decline ALL additional options, gas, insurance, etc., expect to get billed upon checkout for things you declined.\n\nThen submit an online complaint to them, and expect it to take2+ emails later to get the additions credited. (I am waiting for my bill credits, even though I have an email stating they will)\n\nOverall, SHADY business practices, go to a reputable rental place if you want to be treated like a human."
2,"there's a lot of mixed reviews about studio b buffet being both good and bad. you figure that showing up saturday for dinner, you'd get the better end of the spectrum. eh.\n\nhere's the lowdown:\n-king crab legs [both warm and cold] were a tad bit too salty. the forked plastic tool used to assist in yanking out the meat did not help but at least the crabs were pre-cracked [standard these days, anyhow]. just give me a pair of chopsticks, and i can do wonders.\n\n-oysters. no mignonette sauce. aahhhhhhhh! these were definitely not the best, but at least they were somewhat still fresh. since i love \""me\"" some oysters, the majority of my plate[s] consisted of these clam shells - with lots and lots of lemon juice. \n\n-prime rib was somewhat decent. i'm not a big fan of prime rib anyhow, but i'd agree with Pauline C. that it's above buffet quality standards.\n\n-the rest of the fillers were typical. after a few samples, i didn't even bother with the rest. sometimes you can tell how good or bad something is simply by looking at it [or smelling it in my case].\n\nthe dessert - probably the only reason why the ratings are so high i'm not a dessert person, but i somehow ended up partaking in a few delicacies. i caved for the presentation alone and indulged in what looked like a chocolate and vanilla mousse cup and gelato. yum!\n\nmy conclusion - it's overrated. skip the buffet, and go for something nicer altogether for the same price. your stomach may not be as full but your body will thank you later for it."
1,"Terrible terrible service!   \n\nFood was ok.    Seafood soba was good, char kway teow forgettable and chicken rice was disappointing."
1,"This is based solely on the Dobson location as I normally go to the Val Vista location. I went to the Dobson location because my normal location had to reschedule but I'm 40 weeks and have to see a doctor, this location was my option. I waited 20 minutes past my appointment time just to get called back. Then I waited another 40 minutes for the doctor to come in. I heard her talking outside the door for a very long time about tacos, insurance, and other nonsense. I was getting pretty angry because I'm sitting with no pants on waiting to be examined, for 40 minutes, while the doctor (I didn't know it was her at the time) was outside my door shooting the shit. \n\nIt was just a very frustrating experience and I'll never return to this location again."
1,Hostesses are very inefficient causing 50 min wait in line for breakfast at 9:30 a.m. Most items are extremely salty and the quality of food in general is subpar compare to other better known buffets in neighboring casinos. Not worth the wait and money. Drink plenty of water.
3,KOBE Short Rib ... Yeah baby ... It Melt in your mouth literally!!! Yes! Meat melt in you mouth. Bone-In Rib Eye is also amazing. The portion is HUGE though so if you wear that tiny mini party dress like I did then you can only have a bit or two :P Shame on me didn't come prepare!!! Love the Truffle mac & cheese ... Cream spinach w crispy egg. Umm ...
1,"Can't say this was captivating. Convoluted, hard to follow plot. A lot of sword fighting and crawling around on a big rotating platform. I found myself more interested in the mechanics of the stage platform, some impressive hydraulics, then the actual show going on. Looked at my watch every ten minutes. Show is about 90 minutes but crawls. Best part was the guy at the very end, doing jump rope on the big rotating wheel. Other than that, not much to see here."
1,"32 Shea is not the place for large parties.  Went with a group of 10 people.  Was very excited based on the menu.  The location is not the best, but once you are inside, you can't even tell you are in the middle of an old strip shopping center on 32nd street.  It was very nice on the patio and had a great ambience.  When we arrived, the hostess was rude and kept walking by us with a scowl on her face.  Took quite a while for them to get a table together and even then it was too small.  Luckily, most people were sharing food so we had enough room.  The waitress was impatient and forgot to bring one drink (which we later had to have removed from the bill).  I ordered a tuna salad with house made blue cheese dressing.  It was very good.  One of our group ordered a delicious coffee drink and another ordered the moscow mule and said it was great.  One person went to the bar for a margarita and it literally took 20 minutes.  She did like the drink and said it was the strongest she ever had.  When it came time to pay, the waitress said she could not do separate checks and even asked the owner, who also said no, not for big groups.  Would have been nice to know when we sat down.   I asked if there was an ATM and she said no.  I asked if there was one in the shopping center nearby and she said she had no idea.  Instead of giving us any options she simply walked away.  About 10 minutes later, we learned from the owner that while they would not do separate checks, they would allow multiple credit cards.  Again, just tell us and there is no problem.  I really want to try some of their signature cocktails, so I may go back."
0,if there was a way to rate zero stars I would. I'm absolutely frustrated with these guys. Took car into get a simple oil change cuz I had gotten a coupon to do so for half off. when i got the car back there was a broken clutch. wtf???? they offered to fix it for half the cost and i said no. it's your fault for breaking my clutch.. soo they blew me off... towed the car back to my house.. eventually i had to get the car repaired somewhere with a new clutch installed. forget these guys.. will NEVER go back here again.. even the corporate customer relationship guy from higher up asked me if i was doing okay over a phone call a few weeks later. that's all...didn't care that i bought a new clutch.. whatever...all i know is i will never go back there again.! Trust me...they don't care about you one bit.... at all...
0,"Horrible service (Must read)\n\nEdward has to be one of the worst drivers and \""business professional\"" in Vegas..\n\nWe asked for a large limo for 10 people since normal limos only carry 8. They confirmed a stretch 300... Edward , here, shows up in a normal sedan limo. And proceeds to tell our friend in charge that he's wrong and that we ordered a small limo. From this point on he has an attitude.   We bribe him to let us get in and get on our way. We are leaving EDC and traffic is  ridiculous. \n\nNow at this point we notice the left lane he's in is at a dead stop and the right one isn't. We notice because all parking lot are exiting to the left lane.\n\nA female friend of ours asks him politely to switch lanes because there was no reason to be stuck Im that. His response:\n\n\""just calm down, both lanes will eventually go\""\n\nYOU ASS, that's something you tell a 5 year old who's impatient. Not a grown adult who's paying you at least a hundred over asking price. \n\nLater on down the road, still on traffic we put down the partition to ask him to exit for the next bathroom. He says yes, and then we put the partition back up. \n\nHe puts it immediately back down and snaps \""DONT put my partition up because I need to see\""\n\nAt this point we are ready to start throwing stuff at his head. \n\nAnd to top it all off he drives like crap. Super abrupt acceleration and stopping when traffic is going steady. And I know he's not paying attention properly because he's on his Bluetooth talkin to someone in Spanish. I speak Spanish an it was a personal call. \n\nWe are still in the car as I write this, by the way."
4,"NOM NOM NOM. I've ate here 2 weekends in row, which means two straight weekends of TNA, which means my brain is dead. The thought of eating here has got me through my Monday back at work. \n\nBoth times, this place delivered TWICE. Eat here with a bunch of people so that you can try all of the sides. The food is simple but fucking amazing. 22oz Bone in ribeye, mashed potatoes, garlic string beans, mushrooms, lobster mac, sauteed onions."
1,The food is OK.  The service is awful.  The staff is rude & condescending.  Not what you would expect if you are at a nice event.  All I can say is: Do not think of throwing an event here - your guests will be disappointed.
3,"Monday morning 1/5/15, 50 yrs old, partner moderately good shape, temperature 68 degrees, two bottles of water, oatmeal breakfast and coffee, up to the top in about 40 minutes and back in 30 with 20 minutes at the top.  Cliff bars would have been nice as we started bonking at the end.   Parking not a problem on the weekday mornings, at least for us.  Surprised at the number of people and the diversity in physical ability.  Lots of teenagers and Don't take your dog.  Totally enjoyable and the views are worth the pain and yes, slightly anerobic exertion at the top where the rocks are daunting but doable. The trip down can rack the knees and while good boots are nice to have, tennis shoes are fine.  Well maintained and more enjoyable than anticipated given the location."
2,"Not the best Roys I have been to but still a good place to stop in for dinner escpecailly if you are looking for something off the strip. Standard dishes and \""Hawaiian Classics\"" fill the menu and the decor isnt the best. Overall good but not a great branch of the Roys Empire.\n\nRoys Baltimore is still number one in my book out of the 6 I have been to."
3,"Fantastic!  This was our second time around, and everything is just wonderful.  Along with the wide variety of meats they serve three side dishes that consist of mashed potatoes, polenta and plantains.  They also serve warm cheese bread to go with your meal.  The polenta and cheese bread are to die for.  Servers are always attentive and replace sides and cheese bread as needed or.  The meat is succulent, cooked really appropriately.  There were times I felt the seasoning was a little off, but I am known to be a salt freak.  \n\nThe way it works:  They have you start with the salad bar.... Resist the urge, there's so many yummy meats you will want to eat.  If you must, there is a wide variety of veggies, cheeses and other anti pasto to choose from (keep this light).  \n\nWhen ready for meat service, simply flip your green/red card green and servers will immediately bring you your sides, and new plates for your meats.  As long as your card is green the meat servers will stop by your table and offer you meat - use the provided tongs to grab meat."
3,"Stumbled across Hash-House-A-Go-Go's menu on the Internet and couldn't WAIT to try it when we got to Vegas. I was stuck trying to decide between the Sausage Gravy Pot Pie (which seemed like a perfect cure for my Vegas hangover) and the Chicken & Waffles. I ended up opting for the Chicken & Waffles because the server said it was the second most popular item on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the first, Man VS. Food's top pick, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portions were ginormous, easily shareable, and the prices were reasonable (for Vegas). Plus, they're open 24hrs, so it's perfect for drunk munchies or a hungover brunch."
4,"Stopped in randomly tonight with a couple of friends... always drive by and noticed how good it smelled but tonight was the first time I dined in... my only regret - not coming here sooner!  I had the \""Ronin Burger\"" and was blown away. We ordered garlic salt and pepper fries, sweet potato fries, shrimp chips and pickled vegetables for the table - all of which were incredible. The fries were complimented by some tasty dipping sauces and when it was all said and done I was completely satisfied and out the door for about 20 bucks (including a beer to wash it down). Great food and affordably priced... bachi burger is on my list to return in the very near future!"
2,It is fast and good
0,WORST EXPERIENCE!!!  The doctor came to the hospital to give my son a circumcision and while doing it misdiagnosed my son with having hypospadias.  Because of that she had to stop the circumcision and left my son with a partial circumcision.  He just had to get surgery to correct the error that this doctor did.  He had to go under general anesthesia.  It was an awful experience that no one should have to go through.
1,This place would be better if the dj played more than 30 seconds of each song. Watch the crowd dj! Sand bar-get a new dj and you will have better weekend profits!
4,"Wow. This place is awesome!i love it and. I don't even like Mac n Cheese lol \nThe restaurant is like half fast food and half normal restaurant. \nThey have modern music playing in the back ground, very chill, very relaxing. It has a really good vibe to it. \nIt's super clean, the staffs are very friendly, everything is very organized. \nThe portion they gave us was enormous, you can order one order for two normal size people. We ordered one each and didn't finish but hey, I love left overs lol \nWe had the buffalo chicken Mac, which was AMAZING! It was so so delicious, it tastes like you're eating an actually buffalo chicken wing and it even has carrots and celery! Haha it was so good. \nThe other order we ordered was the smokehouse Mac. It wasn't my fav but it wasn't the worst thing in the world, my bro in love loves it just as much as the buffalo. When you eat it you can taste the smokiness flavor in the Gouda cheese. Oh yeah, they have different cheese for each kind of Mac. \nAnyway, it was a very pleasant visit. \nI wouldn't mind coming back. :p"
0,"With two very good, family run BBQ spots within 7miles of this place, I'm not sure why anyone would go here.  Their BBQ sauce is not homemade, it arrives at the store in bulk, and is no better than something you would find at Safeway.... full of additives, preservatives,  \""natural flavoring\"", and most absurd, GLUTEN.  Skip this place and go to Cooper's or Joe's in Gilbert."
4,"This is my favorite spot when I'm in mesa, I always hit it, love the food and the staff, always going above my expectations!!!! Love it."
3,"Coal Burger offers a healthier spin on your normal fast food burger place, which is refreshing. You can satisfy your craving and not feel too guilty about it after. Also, they  are very eco-friendly, from the straws they use, to the materials their tables are made of, even the bathrooms stress green-ness. \n\nI normally get the 1/3 coal burger on a gluten free bun with mixed fries. This amount of food always leaves me full, but not with the heavy feeling of a greasy meal. Which is something that I love about them - no nasty grease! The fries are cooked in rice oil, the beef is coal fired, AND they have gluten free buns?? It is really nice to have options when it comes to this kind of cuisine. \n\nThe service is great, everyone is friendly. My order is always comes out perfect, just like I ordered it. \n\nI give the 4 star rating because I haven't tried a lot of other items on their menu."
3,"Wonderful breakfast spot. Seems to be pretty popular with the locals, but both times we arrived by 9a & sat at a lovely shaded tables outside. \n\nThe red velvet pancake is quite delicious & my eggs were cooked perfectly. My husband enjoyed his Arizona Scramble (with over easy eggs instead of scrambled)."
0,"I recently went here with a group of friends. The atmosphere feels like somewhere you would go with your grandparents and hasn't been updated in 20 years. The waitress was very kind at first and gladly offered to do separate checks. At the end of our dinner she gave us separate checks with an attitude and said she would never do that again... Well why did you gladly offer in the first place. I felt like our presence their was an annoyance to the employees which made a bad experience for me. I got the Chicken Romano and it was the worst chicken I've had in a very long time. It had no flavor and tasted like they took chicken breast, put flour on it, and fried it without a single seasoning. The green beans I got were hard and half were overgrown with the pods popping out. I understand you're going to pay higher prices downtown but for $19.99, I could've gone to KFC and had a better experience and better meal. It was so bland and gross that I couldn't finish the chicken and I went to McDonalds after and I won't be going back."
2,"Have to say I'm slightly disappointed. The Nutella crepe was just ok, too much sugar. The brioche was good. The almond croissant was ok. Overall, I actually much prefer bakeries I've had in Santa Barbara. A disappointment, and not worth it's own trek down the strip to get here."
0,"Slow slow slow, you will wait for at least 25 mind to 40 min before food arrives, the restaurant is also filthy.  Floors are messy and so are tsbles."
4,"I absolutely love this barn! The facilities are nice and well taken care of, and the horses are well cared for. I have been boarding my horse here for a while and could not be happier! The people are nice and the trainers are great. I'm so glad I found this place:)"
0,"Update: With a generous gift card from some kind of regional manager (in response to our comment card from the previous visit), we returned, for what will be my last time.\n\nFirst, they brought me my steak with the wrong sauce--their pepper sauce instead of the shallot butter I ordered. I sent it back, and they brought me the right sauce--with the wrong steak. Funny enough, it was the same Heinz Ward steak I'd been unhappy with in my previous review.\n\nThis time, in fairness, my steak was at least cooked a perfect medium-rare. I'm still unimpressed with the flavor of the meat itself, though. It just tastes a little watery compared to the stuff at other restaurants I've been to.\n\nI had three bites and stopped eating, and I am pleased to say that they didn't charge me for the steak. But again: At a place this pricey, I just expect my experience to be at least an B+, and I haven't had anything over a C-."
0,"Im just more upset then anything......aside from this fact the food is ok....just kind of a glorified panera.....not very many vegetarian options (been a veg for over 15 years and would like something other than salad or a grilled cheese sandwich)...anyway..my boyfriend ate there yesterday and exactly one hour after eating he got a HORRIBLE headache and stomach ache and threw up several times...i called zupas and asked to speak to a manager...i let her know the situation and told her exactly what he ate...all she said was ok thank you ill check everything..never said im sorry, never said hope he feels better..nothing....i dont know...ive owned a restaurant before and if that happened i would apologize and at the very least wish the person well....just bugged me"
4,"We tried this place for the first time EVER today only because it was by the area where we went for a DR appt. While waiting, I found it on yelp. Although it had a few contradicting reviews, we decided to give it the benefit is the doubt. Let me say.... Best decision ever! We LOVED it. Service was awesome, which we later found out the owner was the one to wait on us. I tend to panic when trying new things, therefore I tend to keep my orders simple. However, he suggested the Hobo Skillet and it was too delicious. Then we ordered a short stack to try them out and I was once again, impressed. I hardly even needed syrup from how moist and great tasting the pancakes were. I would definitely make the drive from Henderson to eat here again. Highly recommended to all. Especially pancake lovers!"
4,"OK, I've lived here 5 years and never heard of the Scottsdale Green Belt. One day while searching yelp for biking trails I came across the this place. I searched to find where to start, where to stop. \n\nWe've tried the first part of the \""greenbelt\"" starting at 92nd St. and Shea and rode our bikes to Chaparral Park and back. What a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. \n\nThe second time we started at Chaparral Park and took it to Tempe Town Lake where we stopped, watched the boats, enjoyed a light snack and headed back. We had so much fun. \n\nI must tell you I am so disappointed it took me this long to find this place. I love it and can't wait to get out again."
4,"Ate here last Thanksgiving with the family.  Food and service were excellent.  I ordered the Bone-In New York, rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  Tender and very flavorful.  \n\nPortions are excellent for the price and we all left satisfied and happy."
3,"Beautiful, thin crust artisan pizza! Super cute restaurant - tiny. We went for lunch so didn't have to wait at all, but I can see it getting VERY crowded."
2,"I had a delicious apple cider margarita. My friends told me that their margaritas have 5 shots in them, which I didn't believe because it tasted like applesauce... until I was stumbling around about half an hour later.\n\nWe shared some nachos, which were good (but that may just have been the drunk munchies) but the portion was too small to be worth $6. They were stingy with the chips, and it was depressing to have so much cheese sauce left and no (socially acceptable) way to eat it. \n\nThe service could have been better. The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and the waitresses were really strict about who could sit down. You could only sit at a table if you personally were eating food. You couldn't even sit with your friend who ordered something unless you were eating it too. Our waitress seemed like she wanted to get us out of there (or at least away from the table) as quickly as possible. I understand that the place is small and tables are precious, but they could have been more gracious about it. That night, there wasn't a line to come inside and most people there weren't eating anyway, so we were standing around blocking the aisles with empty tables everywhere."
2,"Judging from the reviews I read about the service here, I must have come on an off night, (it was Friday night), because the service was decent. \n\nWe got seated right away and the server took our drink order. Chips and 3 different types of salsa came a few minutes later, along with water. It's pretty art-deco looking for a mexican restaurant - overall the vibe was ok. For appetizers, I was curious so I ordered the Avocado Fries. Not bad, but to me, it seemed to be missing something. For the main entree, the wife and I both ordered the Shrimp & Crab Enchiladas. I liked it - it had the right amount of spiciness from the poblano chilies, but mi esposa thought it was a little too salty. For dessert, order the Helado Frito (fried ice cream). It was nice and crispy, like it was made fresh. We both enjoyed it. \n\nIt was a good dinner for me, not outstanding, but definitely not negative, and hey, at least the server kept our water glasses filled in a timely fashion. I may visit again if I ever go back to the Silverton."
4,"Not only is this place affordable, but the quality of work is also great.  All the ladies in there are friendly and they know what they are doing! Before taking your altered clothes home, you can try them on and make sure its exactly what you want.  All the clothes I have altered are just right and fit like a glove.  It only takes 2-4 days before your clothes are finished. I would recommned this place to anyone who needs alterations done on anything!!"
3,"We got last minute tickets to Lady Gaga for just $38 on StubHub.com and I was so excited to go to this concert housed in the MGM!!! Upon a friend's suggestion we arrived at the MGM around 5pm so we could find parking and eat dinner on property. As we all know, Las Vegas is a weird place where if the stars align it's possible to get stuck in traffic on the strip for days and it can take just as long to walk through a property because of the sheer size.\n\nThe people watching at a Lady Gaga concert is a close second to seeing Lady Gaga perform. The costumes, oh the costumes!!! Bubbles dresses, mermaids, women in gold leotards, men in gold leotards, every leather outfit imaginable and colored wigs galore! We got through the gate at around 7pm and it was smooth sailing to our seats. Check in is really easy and they're very organized.\n\nThe concession was another story as I ordered a churro and when I bit into it what I got was an ice cold churro popsicle. The lady at the counter was nice enough to give me a refund but I thought it weird that she didn't even ask if I wanted a new one.  \n\nAnother downside to our experience was that the video screen was blocked by a beam so that was a bit disappointing but well, we did have the world's most awesome nosebleed seats. I mean they were $38...\n\nBUT I can say that the sound was phenomenal and we had a BLAST!!!!!!!! Ga-ga-oooooo-la-la! I'm pretty sure I'm going to be a #LittleMonster for life!"
0,We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.
3,"My second visit there... we just sat at the bar for some drinks and desserts... I loved their sangrias... so good that I don't even want to make my own at home anymore (even though it will be cheaper)... the crepas always so good... not too sweet, not to much... just perfect... I can keep going there just for the sangrias and the crepas... this was the last stop in my mexican restaurant tour... well done..."
0,Food was good but the service was bad. Waitress brought out my item but forgot to place the order for the other person with me. When she corrected her mistake the wrong item was brought out. Finally got the correct item but took it home. When we got the bill it was wrong. Got the one item free but the whole meal should of been free. First and last time. Too bad because the food was good.
3,"Went here this past Tuesday with my wife.  We arrived at about 6:45; we didn't have a reservation and the place was PACKED.  The hostess offered to put our name on the list and told us it would be about 45 minutes.  We had her put out name down, and we went to the bar to grab a drink before happy hour ended at 7.  I believe the drink specials were $4 wells and beers, $6 wine and selected cocktails.  She had a wine, I had a Keg Margarita.  The margarita was nothing special, but I'm a bit of a tequila/margarita snob.\n\nWe managed to find table in the bar area large enough to accommodate my in-laws, who met us around 7.  I ordered the 8-oz top sirloin dinner ($28, I believe).  It came with a salad, a baked potato (that I loaded with toppings) , and about 2 bites of asparagus.  I ordered it medium-rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  The steak was juicy and tasty; I saved some to take home with me.\n\nMy wife got the crab legs.  She's really into crab legs generally; me, not so much.  She enjoyed them.\n\nOverall, a pretty good place.  My wife and I paid about $90 after tax and tip for 2 full meals, 1 drink each, and split a shrimp cocktail with my in-laws.  Because we were in the bar area, it was a bit loud, but that didn't bother me.  We had a good time, and I'll definitely go back for happy hour at some point.  It's a bit on the pricey side for dinner, but a pretty good \""occasions\""-place.\n\nGet a reservation EARLY if you want to sit in the dining room, even midweek."
1,I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline.
1,"We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.\n\nThe burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.\n\nThe service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit."
0,"Terrible impression from the start. Staff are young kids that aren't concerned with happy customers. It's not a traditional restaurant set up, I'd liken it to a McDonalds experience. If you like standing in line and serving yourself a soft drink at the soda fountain then you will love it. I was expecting to be seated and have a waiter...this is NOT that kind of place. Food overall was ok at best. I had a salad and hubby had the Diablo burger and truffle fries. His burger had a good spice. The beef didn't have a good texture. Our fries were hard and not even hot. The kale salad was ok. With all the great burger places in the valley, I wouldn't repeat this mistake."
0,"SOOO Disappointing.  Nice views of the backs of buildings, air conditioner units on rooftops and parking lots.  The picture taking is especially disappointing.  View from the rooftop bars at some of the casinos and the Eiffel Tower are much better.  This is going to go down in history as one of the worst projects of all time.  Once the newness wears off, I expect it will be emptier than it already is.  There are no crowds.  The music on the pods is annoying and the video in inane trivia and blather and bad jokes.  The pods are so self-contained you dont feel like you are moving.  Just a long elevator ride."
4,I really liked this restaurant. The pizza choices are very unique and delicious.  They have more than just pepperoni and sausage here.   Their unique pizzas are worth a try.  We started off the meal with some mozzarella cheese as an appetizer and it was fantastic!  Their wine list is extensive as well.  You definitely must try Grampa's Pizzeria!
1,"The food was super salty!!  The beef stew which we tried to order a pound of was barely edible with rice.  Notice I said tried...  we ordered a pound ($8) only to be told it's only available as a take out item and that they would kick us out if we ate it there.  But we could order 3 side dishes at $3 and that would equal a pound.  We'll take 2.  The owner stood and watch the server scoop to make sure she wasn't going to give us extra.  Awkward!! \n\nWe ordered the roast pork appetizer only to be told they just sold out of it.  Ok, give us one of the 3 ducks hanging in the window.  Sorry someone came in right now and bought the last three.  Well, let's go won ton noodle soup.  The broth was super salty but flavorful and the won tons were tasty.  30 minutes later they told us they had more duck and roast pork.  Great we'll take a side dish of both.  Sorry you can only buy in lbs.  Ok we will take a pound.  Duck was super fatty and the skin was not crispy at all, yuck.  I must admit the pork was good.\n\nI expect service at Chinese restaurants to be horrible and they met and exceeded my every expectations."
2,"I had the time to read all the latest reviews and I have to agree with some that say that it's not absolutely outstanding but just okay. I ordered the 10\"" pizza with sausage, mushrooms and bell pepper. It was the sausage I would say that was a little scarce however overall it was okay for lunch. Service was normal. Just another average and expected lunch. No complaints but not memorable. I'd come back.."
4,Fantastic restaurant within the beautiful towns square area. Food was great I had the meatballs and garlic bread. Goblets are amazing me and my boyfriend had a lovely time here. We had purchased a groupon and had plenty of good. Also brought a goblet to bring home which was wrapped in a lovely bag. Our waitress was fantastic and all other staff appeared to be very professional and welcoming. Will defo come back here a truly lovely spot in Las Vegas. In fact I'm so glad this was available on groupon as I didn't even know town square existed !!
3,"Just moved to SW Las Vegas and ive been going here to get my nails done. I get the gel mani and regular pedi for $50. I did get the gradiation style last time which is $10 more. Its really pretty and last for a long time. Mine lasted for at least 3 weeks. Peggy is my lady and i like all of her recommendation when it comes to accent nails. Also, dont forget to ask for your stamp card. :)"
3,"Drove by and decided to take a look. I did find two lamps that went with my master bedroom set quite nicely. Although i assumed that the price that was tagged were for both lamps, they were for each lamp. Pricey yes, but i really did want them. I will return again, but please lower your prices so i can buy more!!!!"
3,"I love this place! I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like their prices are a little high but it's still really good! I used to work down the road from this place and everything that I tried was amazing! Their Cobb wrap, tuna sandwich, harvest salad are all great! They have a half sandwich half salad or soup which is great they have different soups  every two days. And don't forget their delicious cookies or fruit and yogurt parfait with granola it's to die for!"
4,"I think AMEX is trying to court me into some higher annual membership fee credit card and I think I like it.\n\nWho wouldn't love a complimentary cocktail bar and buffet line to break up the busy hustle of travel? This is a haven for the weary, but not the masses. Take privacy in a little nook area or sit out in the dining floor and chat with fellow travelers. Super nice perk."
3,"Memphis, Central Texas, St Louis.  These are pilgrimage sites for the BBQ faithful.  And while Pittsburgh doesn't rank on that scale yet, if the meat coma I got from the ribs at Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is any indication then they are definitely on their way.\r\n\r\nAnd even though the ribs are flavorful and juicy enough, thanks to an incredible rub, that they don't even need sauce on them you should still get the sauce because its vinegary/peppery taste has enough spice to enhance the meat, but not overpower it."
2,"At a conference and had an hour for lunch.  Waited close to 40 minutes for Wagyu burger which came out well done, not medium. Had no time to complain just gobbled it down since I needed to get back to conference.  Others at bar waited close to an hour...they need to fix their line cooks and could use an expediter.  Bartender was trapped with no way to check orders - not good.  Hopefully this was just a glitch today but I would give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the experience."
1,"While my boyfriend was road raging, and super cranky cause of his empty stomach I was frantically searching YELP for a quick fix! And so I came across Musashi and decided to give it a try. \n\nWe didn't do the teppanyaki, as I prefer other places. Just ordered off the sushi menu.(Either Geisha House is great!)\n \nI can't say any of the food was bad @ Musashi, but I just didn't care for the place. Felt a little dirty, I wasn't offered a sake menu, the server was nice but WAY to chatty. I just did not want share my life story with or hear his for that matter!\n\nGood location, and they are open late, but so are a lot of places in Vegas. \n\nNot sure why it has so many stars from other but, to each his own!"
2,"Their food is good, and the sides are good.   \n\nNow, on to the big 3:\n\nPrice:  Pretty typical, and non-effective in correcting the high prices of fast food.  A single diner can expect to pay $8-11 to eat one meal.  I'm guessing that no energy is expended to correct the high prices of one dinner meal.\n\nService:  Everyone I've talked to has been pleasant, and smiling, if even on an only-superficial basis.\n\nTaste:  The chicken items taste just like chicken.  It's everything you would expect.  Nothing fantastic.\n\nIn Summation:  They close as early as 9pm, and ALSO on every Sunday."
4,My boyfriend & I were here tonight. Stephanie was fantastic! The food incredible-- we will now be regulars. Thank you:)
1,"I've been to this Krispy Kreme at least a dozen times over the past decade, between all the Vegas trips we take...\n\nAnd I must not have been back in quite a while, but, THEY CLOSED DOWN THE FACTORY! All the doughnuts seem to be shipped in, or are produced in another location. Strange - no more hot Krispy Kremes off the line :("
0,"What a joke this event is. It's a lot of delusional people calling themselves artists peddling their over priced trinkets on the streets. With the addition of several food trucks sprinkled throughout the various streets it basically makes this event a glamorized swap meet. Wow, how exciting! With so much to do in Vegas I don't understand why this attracts so many people. Try it once if you don't believe me but I'll never go back. Huge disappointment.    \n\nThe good: park at the government center and catch the free shuttles to the event and back. They serve alcohol - you'll need it to trudge through the hour or two you're there. Most of the food trucks have decent food. There are a handful of actual artists who deserve to be paid for their gift."
3,"Cash only, usually only open for lunch, but definitely one of my favorites! It's crowded and  can be slow, but it's all worth it for the food!"
0,"What can I say?... We've been to the Old Fashioned four times, and, yes, the food is good and, yes, they have a nice selection of beer at a reasonable price. What I don't like about the Old Fashioned is waiting well over an hour to be seated with no real room at the bar to relax while we wait.\n\nOur last straw was the night we went to see a play on a Thursday night that started at 7:30. We arrived at the Old Fashioned at 5:30. Our mistake was not realizing this restaurant is treated like Sardi's by the people in Madison who are apparently willing to stand and wait a considerable length of time to eat an egg-topped burger.  We waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated. It had originally started out as 45 minutes but the wait time kept getting extended. We finally had to leave before we were seated to make it to our play on time. When we went back after the play to finally get a bite to eat, they wouldn't let us back in because my daughter wasn't 21. And that's how that went...\n\nSure I like a good burger, but service is important to me also. We won't be going back.  If you're looking for some great cheese curds, just hit a Mallards game.  You'll get delicious cheese curds, a place to sit and a great game to watch!"
3,"Service was outstanding, I enjoyed the grilled dishes from the Izakaya menu. Tuna Poki was good, pork belly was tasty, but the sushi rice in the two rolls we got was a little off. Good sake selection and some nice beers, everyone was friendly. It was a Tuesday night so not busy, all we had to do was glance at someone working in the dining room and they were right there to get us whatever we needed. I will be back."
2,"Lingerie that I can order from my room at all hours....AMAZING! So Love Jones is WAY overpriced, but they have some very unique and erotic items that will make you drool as you walk by the window displays which change....hourly, I believe. \nI'm a total sucker for window displays, and on this particular trip, i was struck by the gorgeous Beach Bunny bathing suit display. \nhttps://www.beachbunnyswimwear.com/index.cfm\nThese bathing suits are as close as you can get to wearing lingerie during the day...and they are fabulous. Because Love Jones carries them, makes them A-OK in my book.\nThe gold star pasties were a HUGE hit. I bought them for my girlfriend's bday to go under her hot pink dress, and let's just say we saw a lot of those pasties all night!\nIf you have won in the casino, or have a boy who has money....go here and have a blast trying on/buying lingerie you can really only find in places like Las Vegas."
3,"I like this place for business travel.  Within walking distance to lots of cute restaurants.  Good breakfast, comfy beds and quiet nights sleep."
2,name changed to El Segundo Sol but website remains cafebabareeba.com
0,"the manager, Debra is the rudest thing. Tried to intimidate me and told me off. DD is not worth it for that treatment."
1,"Between 2 and 3 stars. A few things were good (turkey, beef ribs). Tri tip would've been good but it was very undercooked. Consensus is a step up from Old Country Buffet."
1,"Employees were very helpful with an exchange we recently made.  Although the person in the check out failed to tell us the shoes were $15 cheaper.  The shoes we were exchanging were never worn and still in the box.  I let her know at the checkout that I would like to return, and then repurchase.  She told me that it's an exchange and that I can not.  As a consumer, it is my right.   It shouldn't matter.  She went ahead and did not do what I requested, and told me that I will be able to use my $20 when I buy $50, so it doesn't matter anyway.  I am so disappointed in the customer service with this store."
1,"The lack of concept and decor kind of bummed me out as the space felt cavernous and cold.\n\nDrinks were good, but not like \""omg this is so good you have to try this.\""\n\nThe adirondack chair area was... interesting."
0,"The experience of eating at Dick's is fun, and probably better if you have a large group. The shtick is that the wait staff is rude/obnoxious, and it can be pretty funny.\n\nThe food wasn't as fun.\n\nI had the pulled chicken sandwich which was OK, but nothing great.\n\nHowever, my wife had the \""Cheesy Mofo Burger\"" and was the worst burger that either of us had ever had. It didn't taste like beef--it was more like a Boca Burger. Just awful. It's crazy to think you can go wrong with that much cheese.\n\nWe both had a couple tall beers and our lunch tab was $60, which was $50 more than this meal was worth."
4,Caf\u00e9 sympathique bien situ\u00e9. Ils offrent de bonnes sandwichs pas cher et de d\u00e9licieuses viennoiseries locales. On peut s'y installer confortablement pour travailler.
0,"I too have been extremely disappointed by Public Mobile. I am not a chronic complainer and am generally pretty laid back, just FYI.\n\nI wanted a no contract plan that allowed me to use the phone on both sides of the border. The ZTE phone the fellow suggested that get is absolute garbage. I hate everything about it. It's too bad because I have a perfectly good iPhone at home. When I went to buy it I asked them if there was one I could try out first. He said none were powered up. But when I committed to buying he pulled one out and it had a full battery. If I had been able to try it, I wouldn't have bought it...it's that bad.\n\nBeyond that, service coverage isn't what was explained. Large parts of New England are not covered, even parts that Public Mobile explained were. So, the phone really is useless to me much of the time, which is a bad thing for a small business owner on the go.\n\nI've had the phone for a month and spent Christmas through New Year's in Boston. The screen blacked out and while the phone rings, it is not functional. Hadn't been dropped or anything. So here I am for nearly a month without a phone, which again, as a business owner, is a real handicap. Thankfully I can check the voicemail through another phone.\n\nThis service COULD be good in another couple of years, but right now it's just rubbish. I really do feel like I was oversold an underdeveloped service with an inferior phone. This might work for a high school kid in Montreal, but for a serious professional who needs a reliable phone, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE 12 Jan 2014: I spoke with 2 customer service reps today. It usually takes 20-30 mins to get someone to pick up. Anyway, I asked them to delete my credit card info from the automatic billing because I'm no longer interested in the service. The scheduled billing date is 8 days away. They responded with \""Sorry, it takes 15 days to cancel a scheduled payment, so you'll have to wait until next month.\"" Yeah, right. I told them I'd report the charges as fraudulent with my credit card company, and they did an about face, saying that they'd \""make a special exception for me.\""\n\nI also asked them to refund the previous month's charge as the phone wasn't working during that time. I also wanted to have the $20 in my \""wallet\"" refunded, as the phone is broken. They responded \""Sorry, we're a no refund company.\"" I requested to speak with a manager, they said they'd have him/her call me back. It's now evening, I spoke with them at 9am and I'm not getting my hopes up.\n\nOne last fun thing: the reps were both nice, and I was also courteous. But after having been on the phone with one rep for an hour and having been promised a call back, she says, I'll have the supervisor call you on your cell phone.\"" I was amazed that she still didn't get that my phone wasn't working, after having repeated it over and over.\n\nFINAL UPDATE 25 Jan 2014: I never received a call back, as promised. The rep said they were going to give me a free month of service because the phone was out of commission for a month. Well, they have cut my phone service and officially taken me off the map. \n\nMy experience is that this company offers an inferior product with substandard customer service. They've left a real bad taste in my mouth."
2,So so
0,The service was terrible. I would go back again because the food was good but would not go back just because of the service.
2,"What we tried foodwise, was good. \n\nCaesar salad- expected a tiny salad, since it says $3 on HH so we each ordered one. It was huge. Enough to split. Needed more dressing & had a few aged edges, otherwise very good. \nPoutine was also very good. Liked the spicy bangers. This is one awkward dish to describe in words. :)\nOrdered the bread plate, but were quite full when it came. Those pretzels with honey mustard were special, I would order just the pretzels with dip, if it was offered.\n\nOur problem was service. Our server, Jenn, was really good considering that it looked like she was the only server during HH. I counted about 13 tables for just her at one point. Though I give low marks for customer service, it's not to take away from her. She really handled herself with grace, did the best she could and never appeared frazzled. Very professional. She was hustlin'!\n\nLuckily, we were in no hurry. Took about 25 minutes to get water/order drinks; 15 to order food. Food came fast...I wanted to order another seasonal brew, but never saw anyone to order from again until plates were cleared. When the check came, everything but drinks were priced differently than the menu stated. I mentioned it, they \""fixed\"" it, yet the prices were still different than what the menu stated. False advertising is not cool. I felt really mislead, so ya not a great ending to what was surprisingly good food.  \n\nI just felt kind of bad for the server & hope mgmt can get it together. Could be 5 stars here! Need smaller portions on happy hour; as a customer, I'm not expecting a huge portion on an HH menu."
0,"And the award for the worst customer service goes to  . . . Foot Solutions in Scottsdale!\n\nMy husband has issues with his feet and requires special (aka ridiculously expensive) shoes.  I have been to this store numerous times and every time it is the same scene.  I am completely ignored by the staff (INCLUDING THE OWNER) as they are far too busy having personal conversations to even acknowledge my presence.  Did I mention this was is a shoe store?  Not exactly the kind of place you can just help yourself.\n\nAfter today, I have decided to take my money somewhere else!  If you are in need of a solution for your foot, I suggest you do the same."
3,"It seems that Chi-town has come to me even though I just moved away from there! There's a few Rosatis in Chi-town that I've had pizza in. Now, it's no Pizzano's in downtown but it will suffice for being 1,500 miles away from good pizza. :D"
4,this place is truly outstanding. it is located in an office park not far from the strip.  the setting is simple but the service is superb.  the two women who run it are gifted at their craft. their prices r absurdly low for what the get.  highly recommended.
1,They lost the vibe of the original cafe with this small weird choice of  location.  I agree with another reviewer feels like Starbucks and when am I in this area.  A one and done for me as Sunrise and Grouchy Johns deliver a better overall experience.
1,"If anyone wonders why Albertsons wants to bail out of Southern Nevada just visit this store. Start by doing some comparison shopping on price and you'll find Albertsons is higher than just about any other supermarket chain in the valley. Add in aloof and not very helpful staff working in produce and the meat counter, and don't forget the one checkout lane open experience outside of peak times and there's a good chance you'll wish you were somewhere else. \n\nThis location has a very good Starbucks staffed by great baristas who are very good at what they do. \n\nBut even a great Starbucks can't cover the fact that your pocketbook gets ripped off when you come here. Don't send your money to Eden Prairie, MN where their corporate office is. Go elsewhere...the savings differences will astound you if you comparison shop. \n\n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #12)"
0,"I have only been to this vet once, for routine shots for my 6 month old puppy.  I chose this vet because it was close to my house.  I called and made an appointment and no one was in the waiting room when I arrived.  In fact, other than standing in the center of the reception area, there is nowhere to wait other than a plastic bench in the far corner, about as far away from the reception area as you can be while still being in the same room.  \n\nI was quickly put into a small, airless examining room with my dog.  And there we sat.  For 45 minutes.  I am not claustrophobic, but if I were, it  would have been terrible.  A vet tech finally came in and whisked the puppy out of the room after saying about two sentences to me.  I waited for another 15 minutes, and then I heard voices outside of the door where my dog had been taken.  I stood up and looked through the window in the door to see four vet techs standing around shooting the breeze.  I think one of them saw me looking because all of a sudden I had my dog back and I was out the door.  I never saw an actual vet,  so I can't comment on how good the vet medicine is.  \n\nBack in the reception area, I presented a coupon I had printed from their website, but they wouldn't accept it.  They told me it was expired even though it didn't have an expiration date and then they denied that I got it from their website.  Total cost: $80 and I was then told that the puppy would need another round of shots in four weeks, even though they had originally told me she wouldn't need any more shots for a year.  And if you want to get your dog fixed, they will tell you over the phone that it is $80, but then when you ask for an estimate in the office after the exam, they tell you that they have to do bloodwork and then suddenly it is $180.  I took my dog down to spay and neuter center and it was $100 for everything, including pain meds.  \n\nAfter I left the office, I looked at my receipt and I had been charged $20 for an \""exam\"".  I know my dog was not examined because all of the techs were out talking in the hall.  \n\nIf you need something simple like shots and you don't mind sitting and waiting in a 6 ft by 10 ft room for an hour and you don't mind chilly receptionists and getting overcharged, then you would be fine taking your pet here.  If you actually expect to see an actual vet or if you expect your veterinary hospital to care about your pet, don't go here."
2,We got two free buffets for the 51's hitting two home runs.  The wait staff was courteous and they always filled up are drinks and we never got a large stack of dish's on are table.  The food was not as impressive some of it was over cooked and under seasoned.  They had a decent amount of food for a lunch buffet but I would be disappointed if we where eating dinner.  It is a long drive for us to get to this buffet and probably won't return unless we receive it free again.
3,"We came for dinner after a long event at MGM. The seating hostess was friendly and the wait was only 10 or 15 min. \n\nThe decor was bright and clean, although it was a little weird that half the restaurant was exposed to the casino floor. But this seems to be the popular design of new restaurants on the Strip today. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly, energetic, and helpful. Prices were very reasonable and the food was done very well. We enjoyed the Kale Caesar Salad, the Hog Burger, the Farm Burger, truffle fries, and shake #4. The portions were very generous that we ended up taking a lot of leftovers to go. Definitely up to par with Gordon Ramsay standards."
4,Great time. \nVery Friendly\n\nFood cooked to order. Amazing Fish Tacos
1,"Nothing to see here, move along.\n\nMediocre food. Bland. Overcooked. Gummy/Pasty Pasta.\n\nNot horrible, but with the number of really good independent Italian restaurants in the valley - why waste your time and money?\n\nSpecifics: \nManicotti - Filled with a tasteless ricotta cheese paste that could double as drywall filler, topped with warm crushed tomatoes and a couple shreds of melted mozzarella.\n\nFettuccine Alfredo - The pasta was sticky and gummy. The \""Alfredo\"" sauce was a plain white sauce with flecks of something that may have been an attempt at seasoning.\n\nItalian Sausage - Way overcooked, dry, like trying to saw wood when cutting into it. Nicely spicy though.\n\nChicken Piccata - Beaten and lightly fried the cutlet was nonetheless dry. Topped with a mixture of mushrooms, capers, and tomatoes. Not just topped, buried under. Disappointing and still the best dish served."
1,"I've struggled for a bit with how to rate this restaurant.  Based on all the spectacular reviews on Yelp, as well as the exorbitant prices and the reputation of the great Joel Robuchon, I was quite disappointed with my dinner here on Monday, January 14.\n\nNeither my boyfriend and I have ever been here, so we tried the Menu B, which allows you to choose one out of the five following courses (http://mgmgrand.com/pdf/atelier_pre_fix_menu.pdf) at $105.00, and the featured Seasonal Menu with the Quail (http://mgmgrand.com/pdf/atelier_decouverte_menu.pdf - the one shown is different from what is offered now) at $159.00.\n\nThe Seasonal Menu is 4 stars on taste, though my boyfriend felt the price is a little on the expensive side for what we got.  We both had the same Amuse Bouche, which was a Foie Gras with a Parmesan Foam - the foam gave the right amount of lightness to the Foie Gras, which I've always found to be very rich.  Another standout is the scallop with chive oil and a bit of garnish.  The quail was also awesome.  Pretty much every course was very good, but the desserts were quite ordinary, though definitely above average.\n\nI with my Menu B was not so lucky.  I think the issue I have is this restaurant's obsession with putting a lot of bells and whistles  on something that should be simplier.  For example, I had the Hamachi, which came with a delicious yellowtail atop a mountain of avocado dip-like thing and some mint!  Neither the avocado nor mint enhanced the yellowtail, which was the star of the dish, but rather obscured it with their weird flavors.\n\nThe lobster bisque was also very odd and not flavorful at all.  There were thin pieces of asparagus, but what I had an issue with was the broth was not savory, but oddly salty, foamy, without depth.  Robuchoun will be spitting on my picture when I say this, but I've had Trader Joe's bisque from a box, which was more delectable.  \n\nFor the fish I had a Chilean Sea Bass, which was nicely cooked, but again, its taste was obliterated and enhanced by some weird herbs.  The star of Menu B was the hanger steak, which was perfectly done with a lovely carmelized shallot on top.  (I had it medium rare.)  The dessert of panna cotta with \""corn ice cream\"" had a few pieces of carmel popcorn thrown into it, which gave the dessert, which would've otherwise been very smooth, an odd crunchy and weird texture/flavor.\n\nThe cocktails - gin martini and the Pomme Brune - were delicious, but they must've come from the bowels of the MGM as our Amuse Bouche came before the cocktails.  At least 10 minutes had elapsed.  When I made a comment to the server (supposedly the bartender himself) that we were \""starving for alcohol\"", there was no reaction.  In fact, the waitstaff, all dressed in black, acted as if we were dining in an ER, where one should be quiet and reserved.  The service seemed oddly joyless as my food.  All of the staff were professional, especially our counter server.  We weren't looking for, \""Are you done with that dessert, hon?  You want more water, sweety?\"" type of service, but the staff seemed a little on the cool side.  Another Yelper had commented that the kitchen staff working never spoke to each other (they do), but now I can understand what she was referring to.  \n\nThe highlights of the evening was the bread, which was delicious...and they give you unlimited bread...which we took, with wanton abandon.  I suppose the Sous Chef, a Frenchman, came around and gave us more mashed potato - which is more like melted butter with a bit of potato thrown in.  That, plus the bread and the slow-moving cocktails were what made the evening for me.  \n\nMy boyfriend (who did not pay for the meal) is more up in arms about the entire experience than I am.  (He asked for 3 baskets of bread, till I threatened to break up with him.)  We do not feel that the high prices were justified.  On the other hand, a couple next to us - a French couple - drove all the way from Scottsdale to the restaurant for the meal.  Of course, they ordered a la carte, and their food looked and smelled delicious.  Unfortunately, at the high price tag, I'll not be going back to try the restaurant anytime soon."
3,"just love this place, really one of the best Chinese in town.\nfast delivery, last time I got it home in less then 20 min.\nlove the dinning atmosphere,  bar & Chinese,  great combo"
4,"I love this place!! My husband plays soccer on a team with his brother on wed nights and had been sneaking over here without me. Well his ass finally got caught and we went one night after a game. Well I walked in and I saw it....SHUFFLEBOARD!!! In my younger days I was a shuffleboard \""champion\"" - yup I said champion. I ordered a pitcher of their 16th street and challenged the boys to a game. Four hours later, many 3 olive shots and some yummy bar food I am still the champion!! We have been there many times since then and have always had a blast!!"
1,"Oh Super 8.  I get it - you get what you pay for, especially in a town like Vegas.  And sure, you're not too far from a lot of the major venues on the Strip (it's about a 30 minute walk to the MGM or a 15 minute walk to the Cromwell).  And hey, free WiFi is always a plus.  But my experience was not particularly great even for that price where my complaints stem from here.  \n\nFirstly, when I got there, I was unable to get a non-smoking room with the best effort being a spray to try and get rid of the smell.  I instead spent a lot of time turning on the fan and keeping the door open to try to get rid of it.  Second, expect little customer service at peak hours as the small staff tries to try to both accommodate the influx of guests and hotel room needs.  Finally, there are a bunch of smaller cons like really smoky hallways, a weird outer area around the hotel and a very barebones continental breakfast.\n\nYou get what you pay for and although it may be one of the better 'budget' hotels, my experience was not great for any hotel experience."
1,"This is my first and last visit to this hotel and casino.  Let me start at the beginning. It is off the strip. Not far but your not going to be wanting to walk.  And driving Las Vegas sucks!\n\nWe reserved, and paid in advance for the room on the hotels website. When we check in were told there's an additional $16 a day resort fee.  I know all these hotels are doing this crap now but it gets to me.  Just add it on to the price of the room upfront.\n\nThe layout of the rooms is confusing. The place really shows its age.  Rooms are small.  Clean but small.  The shower is a little corner deal. With a curtain. No tub. So there water everywhere. Reminds me of a locker room.\n\nThe casino is sad. The people in it look sad.  I don't want to turn into one of the sad people.  I will not be back."
3,It pains me to say that DD no longer has The Gobbler :-[\n\nI don't know if/when I'll be back....
1,"According to some Hallmark card, somewhere 'Life is so precious,/And each day is a gift./So enjoy every minute,/As it were your last to live.' So imagine my disgruntlement to find 25 of those precious, precious minutes frittered away, gone, never to be seen again, while waiting for my (very late) prebooked taxi.\n\n\n Just think what I could have been doing with those beautiful minutes! Dancing, playing chess, smelling flowers! All I actually wanted to do with those minutes, though, was to get to work - hence the reason I booked a taxi. At a mere 15 minutes late I called to ask if it would be much longer:\n\n\n Taxi person - 'It's one minute away, just around the corner'.\n\n\n Me - 'Can you tell me why it's so late? Of course it's not your fault, but I'm now late for work, and I did prebook it earlier this morning, for 15 minutes ago'.\n\n\n Taxi person - 'People are taking their children to school!...' - Now, I had been labouring under the false illusion that people had been taking children to school for quite some time now (decades, even) and yet the world of taxi punctuality somehow managed to keep on turning, but clearly I stand corrected - '...and anyway, people who booked their taxis days ago are still waiting!'\n\n\n Interesting defense. Anyway, time passed. Another phone call, different taxi person:\n\n\n Different taxi person - 'Please hold'.\n\n\n Three minutes pass.\n\n\n Different taxi person - 'It's at least 10 minutes away, stuck in traffic. I'm very sorry'.\n\n\n Me - 'I appreciate the apology, but it's okay, I'll just cancel the taxi'.\n\n\n Different taxi person was nice, I liked her. And as I walked to to the bus stop, I contemplated Ida Scott Taylor: 'Do not look back and grieve over the past, for it is gone'."
3,"Sierra Gold is a nice bar to chill at.  Plenty of people if you don't like the dead atmosphere.  The food's pretty good.  It's good to know the bartender too.  There's pool tables there to play on which is about it.  It's spaced out pretty nicely too, and people can enjoy watching the games on the flat screen televisions."
4,"Lisa G, you had me at Balls! \n\nWho can resist a trio of piping hot tasty meatballs (Veal/Pork/Beef) soaking in a savory red marinara sauce topped with grated parm and served with warm Foccaccia Bread? Not me! These balls are soo good, I had them two days in a row. Yep, I'm a fan but my delight doesn't end with the balls. I enjoyed every other plate I had during my repeat dinning experience. \n\nEmpanadas: Wow! The crust alone is to live for! Each bite melted in my mouth and I enjoyed the tasty center too. \n\nSkewer Plate: This is the perfect sharing dish. Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, and Veggie skewers (2 of each) served with two delicious sauces. Both are good but I preferred the Chipotle sauce. This dish is screaming for a fruit skewer; grilled pineapple maybe? \n\nMini Sandwiches: A great option for a first timer. This dish offers a selection of three mini sandwiches (your choice) from the main menu. I loved this idea because I can try each and decide which one I would like in the big sandwich size. Each were good but the AHI and Chicken Salad were my favorites; AHI being the top. \n\nLisa G doesn't just offer up great food, this is also one cool happening joint. It's a converted 19 something-ish bungalow turned Caf\u00e9, Wine, Art  Bar. The music selection also adds to the dinning experience. Can't go wrong with Billie and Ella singing you through a meal right?  The service was great during both my visits. They were courteous, responsive, and served with a smile both times.  So hey, give at go and don't forget to try them balls. I'm sure you'll enjoy."
2,I used to go to another Greek place right across the street but since they shut down I started to go here.  It's a good thing I discovered them because their food has great flavor and the price isn't too high.  Their gyros are fresh and they don't skimp on the food.  I normally get the chicken salad and it is tasty!
4,My new favorite thing! Love the pizza here sooooo much. You get to eat your pizza and not feel like a hog after!
3,"DP Dough is a lifesaver.  They have a big selection of calzones, and on the off chance you don't see one you like, you can also custom design one (known as \""Construction Zone\"" where you can have up to 4 ingredients).  Personally, my mouth just waters whenever I look over the menu and have to remember that these things are very filling so I can't order the 5 different calzones I'd like to try.  I'm trying to work my way through the list, but so far my favorites include the Testing Zone (breaded chicken, pesto, mozzarella) and a combination of the Veggie Zone and Parking Zone (broccoli, breaded chicken, mushrooms, mozzarella).\n\nAll the calzones are made fresh the moment you order them, are absolutely delicious, and only cost $6.  They're definitely perfect for when you need got the munchies, are studying late at night, or when you discover you're actually really hungry after a night out at the bars, and even better?  They deliver late!!!\n\nMonday - Wednesday until 2am\nThursday - Saturday until 3am\nSunday until 1am\n\nThey do lose some points for their turnover time though.  It takes them upwards of an hour to get the food delivered to you - the reason for which is because they need to make and bake your order first before they can get it out to you.  The plus side to this though, is that your calzone arrives fresh and piping hot with the cheese in the middle still oozing out when you take a bite."
2,"Until the new Target was built on Green Valley, this was the only Target closeby. I was constantly frustrated by the lack of basic food - even the old one on Spring Mountain had a much better (although still small!) selection of dairy, lunch meats and frozen foods. Sometimes you want to be able to go to Target and pick up some f-ing creamer while you're there - not so at this Target. I also find the store layout not all that great and the parking lot is HORRIBLE. There are way too many freaking stores that share the same parking lot and getting in, around, and out of the parking lot is always very stress-inducing. Thank goodness there is a better Target nearby!"
4,wow!  great pizza!  i work in avalon and there's plenty of mediocre pizza in the boroughs..doughboys is by far fantastic!  was well worth the wait and pizza was delicious and arrived piping hot even after traveling all the way to avalon..i was pleasantly surprised at the amount of cheese and toppings!  you gotta try this pizza!!
4,"It was quite the adventure finding this place since I am from out of town and this establishment is located in the depth of a strip mall in Chinatown.... but we found it! And I am SO glad that we did! They have the best ramen that I have had so far (in life). Oh my goodness! \nSo the restaurant itself would be best described as cozy... I wouldn't come strolling in 10+ people deep. Most of the seating appears to be surrounding the kitchen in a bar-like fashion. The menu is pretty basic and to the point - easy enough to order. You have a selection of noodles/ramen dishes to choose from... then you can add extras like egg, nori, etc. The basic ramen dishes are pretty filling themselves....but I added egg and nori for more flavor. Oh. My. God. It's like a flavor explosion. Maybe I'm not experienced enough in the ramen world.... but view become a bit obsessed trying it everywhere I go... and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is the best ramen I've had (so far). If you're a lover of ramen, STOP HERE!"
2,"Stingray is like almost every other sushi place in the Valley, which is to say it is high-priced for what you get and not especially impressive. It's become our default because it's close by and they have raw fish, but the fact that the Chipotle-esque How Do You Roll? is giving Stingray a run for its money on our sushi budget should say something. And not anything good.\n\nAt the very least, go at happy hour. You'll feel better about your spending, and you'll leave sated."
2,"So many varieties of food to choose from!! All beautifully presented. The food didn't taste all that great but what can you expect from a buffet?\n\nI did like the lobster ravioli. There were big chucks of lobster meat with a delish creme sauce to top it off. Don't eat too many because they can be pretty filling. The pesto pizza was also very good. I'm craving for some right now! All the other dishes were just so-so. Not as great as I expected it to be. \n\nTheir dessert area has got to be the prettiest. All beautifully made with assorted chocolate cake, cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries (my fav.), assorted creme puffs, and more. They looked very good and appealing but didn't taste the same way. Chocolate cake didn't taste like chocolate cake. The creme brulee didn't have enough flavor. The desserts were just great to look at. \n\nOverall, I think i'm done with buffets here. They do have a lot of food but its just not that good for me to come back."
2,"Went with friends to celebrate a birthday. Drinks were great especially since they were 1/2 off all night!! Appetizers were yummy, entrees left a lot to be desired. My eggplant Parmesan came with one slice of eggplant and a lot of pasta and sauce that could of have come straight from a jar. My friends burger was just luke warm and the fries were limp. So just blah. We ordered a banana split to share since it was my friends birthday and we happy with that til we saw the same banana split come out to the next table with a firework in it. The server knew it was my friends birthday, so I would have thought a little extra effort would have been made, plus she spilled ice tea on my friend and then has the balls to say to that same friend \""oh, I forgot to charge you for your drink, let me fix that.\"" Really? I would have thought the tea would have been free after you spilled it on her!!! It's a great place for drinks and desserts but the in between leaves a lot to be desired, especially for the prices they are charging for the entrees and the service was just ok."
1,"We went there for lunch because I had a Groupon.  If I would have paid full price, I would have been upset.  \n\nThe service was slow and the food didn't have any flavor.  My husband had the chicken sandwich with a greek salad and I had the Italian Dip with the garlic chips.\n\nNeither sandwich had any flavor whatsoever and the chips were stale and missing the garlic.  The salad was the only entree with any flavor.\n\nI was really disappointed especially after reading other reviews."
2,"Decent bar food. \n\nActually enjoyed the fried pickles very much. We ordered their famous sliders and it was not that bad. I did have to add mustard to it, in order to get more flavor out of the burger. The patty itself was nice and moist. \n\nThe drink are not poured hard, but they give you an option to add an extra shot. That is exactly what I did. \n\nWe tried going there a second time at the end of the night, because it was one of the only places open at this hotel and we failed. If you get take out, they charge you extra. We tried sitting down on a table, but got no service for ten minutes. So we just walked up and left. Had some Starbucks breakfast sandwiches instead!"
4,"We have used Bob's K9 Convenience twice now. The big news here is that Bob and his team have come BACK the second time! You see, we have FOUR dogs. They are a handful! Bob took meticulous notes in our first meeting prior to the visit. He asked great questions and anticipated our requests and the dogs' needs. We even have one dog who doesn't easily warm up to strangers but he did fine. We've never experienced  a service coming into our home while we were gone but this service was very trustworthy. The extra touch of giving us regular reports (emails) was especially reassuring. We added one other request. We feed a feral cat who lives in the neighborhood and Bob's service did not hesitate to tend to the cat's feeding and watering as well. Bob's friendly demeanor is especially appreciated. Well done, Bob!"
3,"I won't hear anyone attempting to take anything away from the quality of a Jersey Mike's sub. They make a tasty sandwich with seriously good ingredients. Were I reviewing based on taste alone, we would be talking about five stars.\n\nBut you can't get out of there with a reasonable meal for anything less than ten bucks. Mike should be grateful that my price-sensitive ass is only removing one star for that."
0,"I've come here a handful of times but I have to give this place a 1 and will never come back based purely off one of the owners being a complete asshole. I think there are 2 owners and 1 is actually very nice, I don't know how to describe him other then well groomed, friendly and the shorter one of the two. The asshole is the big heavy set one who walks around barking orders at employees with never a smile.\nI came here on a Sunday and it was quiet with no one else in the place. I couldn't decide between the rice and salad base and the cute young girl working said I can do half/half. I did that and I asked for extra red peppers and extra cucumbers. Like Chipotle, the trays can get pretty big so she had a hard time closing it. As soon as the owner noticed he said she shouldn't be filling it that high and it gives the customers 2 bowls for the price of 1 and was a complete dick about it. Then he turns to me and says how they can't do that anymore to keep the price fair for everyone. WTF. #1 I didn't fill the bowl, #2 the girl was so nice, friendly and helpful which is pretty uncommon for what's considered a fast-food chain so he should be more appreciative of his employees, and #3 I think he was under the impression I got \""double protein\"" which I didn't. So before he goes off on employees and customers like an unprofessional hungry asshole, maybe he should learn some customer service skills first especially considering this is a new business. He made me feel like I was trying to rip the place off. Even if he thought I did ask for double protein, just charge me extra for it like any other place would instead of flying off the handle."
3,"Driving from Red Rock to Paris Hotel, I was looking for a Pho resturant\nlike I always do when I am in town. My buddy in the car pointed out at Pho Saigon 8 as we were driving down spring mountain. What the hell, I said as always. Already tried 5 different spots and all came up short of being good Pho. Got seated and was brought these huge, color, and pictured menu. Right off the back I knew this place was a real authentic Vietnamese joint. \n\nWent here 3 times in 2 day.enough said.\nPho tai large : soup was very, very flavorful but the large there is our \n                          medium here.. And the bowl was $7. Wtf.. I know\n                          prices have gone up, but how does sink water increase\n                          prices?? And the onion oil helps inchance the flavor of\n                          Pho. Try it.\n#19 Beef Stew/ French bread : Soup was flavorful with nice size beef \n                                                        chunks. Make sure to make a side \n                                                        order for a extra bread. 1 bread is not \n                                                        enough.HA!\n\nThat pretty much sums up my past experience there and WOULD highly recommend this spot.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THESE LOCATIONS!!!\nKim Long II- to bland\nLittle saigon - large is nothing but water and soup was decent\nPho Huong - Brutal , No flavor\nPho Hung - Attention, your pho taste like crap. No flavor"
1,"Honestly, I thought that the only good thing about Canes was the Sweet Tea and the Texas Toast....and really, how can you mess up tea and toast? \nI thought that the rest of the meal was lackluster and overpriced.\nThe chicken fingers were TINY, and virtually everything was woefully lacking in seasonings. \n*yawns*"
2,Hello Las Vegas!!! They need more restaurants in the B terminal...
1,"ordered my two standard \""check it out\"" items during this first visit.  The Ahi Poki salad was drowned in \""dressing\"",  jalapenos (!) overwhelmed the fish - couldn't taste it at all.  The baked mussels were tiny, and far too much dressing again.  Service was good, friendly and prompt, but the place was practically empty.  Parking was good.  I should have maybe stuck with the rolls?  Will continue to patronize my usual spot nearby."
1,"This review is on the service, not the food!!! We came in about 7:33 & I understand that this place is a little busy but at the same time our waitress has already taken our drink/food order & we didn't even get our waters til 8:02.. Which is pretty disappointing considering she(waitress) has walked by us multiple times & nothing.. The other location is alot better"
2,"This place popped up out of nowhere!  We went in for breakfast today and business was booming.  I bet all of the people that work in nearby office places go here for some morning coffee and bagel.  \n\nThey have pretty inexpensive breakfast specials, but like Lindsey said, I wasn't blown away either... I had fruit salad and my bf had a bagel sandwich.  Very limited menu but they do carry Boar's Head meats and sell by the lb.  \n\nGo here for bagels, bagel sandwiches, and possibly a side of potato salad or tuna... not much else at the moment, but they just opened so hopefully their menu will grow to include more egg selections and salads?\n\nVery friendly service, outdoor seating option, and easy parking in the lot as well... great for the Desert Ridge area!"
4,"Amazing food, great service, great value. All you can eat sushi is $21 before 3pm and $25 after that. The appetizers are delicious and several of them have toasted garlic chips that make them incredible. \n\nThe service and vibe is perfect. It's in a strip mall that looks like it won't be good from the parking lot, but opens into a modern decor that feels fresh and welcoming. The waiters are very cool and give great service with a smile. I eat a lot of sushi and Sushi Koma definitely stands our as one of the best."
3,"I came here with the bf and my mom and her sister.  We were looking for food at 9pm and were trying to figure out what to eat.  We passed by the kitchen window viewing area and saw the lobster roll.  We were definitely intrigued and ended up going here after wandering around the palazzo shops.\n\nThe calamari was delicious.  The philly cheesesteak dumplings were delicious.  My aunt got the lobster roll which had SO MUCH LOBSTER.  My aunt said that it was better than the ones she's gotten in Maine.  I had the lobster meatballs which were so delicious.  there was a lot of lobster in them, and the pasta that was served with the meatballs was also excellent.  However, I like pasta without a lot of sauce, and this pasta was perfect for me.  If you like sauce on your pasta, this dish may not be for you.\n\nBf and my mom had the filet which was also excellent.  \n\nThe service was pretty excellent too.  The guy walking around saw that my boyfriend was trying to find out the score in the Pac-10 basketball tournament and he changed it to a Pac-10 game (I think)\n\nA fun take on American comfort food!"
2,"The great reviews on Yelp led my brother and I here. We were warmly welcomed by the Biaggio family. We started with garlic knots. They were tasty - warm, fresh and chewy, but those at the bottom were in a pool of butter. It was not appetizing to me, but my brother loved those drenched in all that garlicky butter. We went with a classic large pepperoni. I thought the crust was really great, crisp and chewy. And it held up well, a feat for NY Style. It was the greasiness that I didn't love. Cheese and pepperoni, should be greasy, but this was more than my arteries could handle. I'd return for veggie pizza or maybe a stromboli or calzone. I heard a waiter talking up the zeppoles for dessert. If I was ever able to save room I'd give those a whirl too."
3,"What can I say, it was as good as everyone says it is!\n\nI went on Sunday, trekked across the desert sands to beautiful old town Gilbert (never been!) And walked intothe most stinkin cute joint I've been to in awhile! Anyplace that has 25cent coffee and CANDY BUTTONS is going to earn high marks from me.\n\nSo why no 5 stars? Its minor stuff, and Joes is more of a 4 1/2 star place in my book. I ordered the chopped brisket sandwhich, after asking the girl in the paper hat if she preferred that or the pulled pork. It was amazing, though I was surprised to find I needed extra bbq sauce, since its cooked in the stuff. No matter, the sauce is free and delicious. Also ordered bbq beans- amazing- and mac & cheese -lost me a bit here. I wanted to love it, but felt it could use something extra and not just be standard mac & cheese. The crumbs were nice, but overall, this was just ok for me. Got a homemade rootbeer to wash it down- great touch. Next time, I'm going for the red cream! To finish (dear God, this was a lot of food lol) I had the apple crisp. Frowny face. Seriously, I \nwas disappointed. For one, I much prefer red apples in a crisp, green tart apples seem wrong to me. Also, my crisp was missing its namesake and was more like slightly chewy. \n\nTotal: $14.11... but did I mention the BOGO coupon for a weekend breakfast they threw in? I'm a sucker for savings!"
3,I just moved to Arizona from Alaska and we did not have any Jack In the Box there...\n\nCan we say delicious!! I am a huge fan of the breakfast menu! When I went here I ordered the bacon burger on the sourdough bread and fries. I was not entirely impressed with that particular sandwich just because I'm not a big sourdough bread fan but wanted to try something different. The fries were absolutely delicious though!! The service at the drive thru was excellent and freindly not your average here is your food blah blah blah. \n\nMcDonalds who?\nI will be back for more Jack In the Box!
2,"The food is good, but I just cannot get past how horrible the service was. It took us almost 2 hours to order and eat our food, what were they doing? The restaurant was not full, it was not busy. Probably will not be going back."
0,They wouldnt refill my cup of water! What place doesnt allow its customers to drink tap water? Such rude service
3,"Been in this airport about 100 times and each time I have a good experience. Free WiFi with many places to plug in your laptop, quick security lines, and smooth baggage claim make this one of my favorite airports west of the Mississippi. \n\nA quick note: This airport is huge, so if you have some time to kill before your flight, you will have no problem entertaining yourself here."
0,I was VERY disappointed with the service. I usually go to a different shop around Sahara but i waned to give Quality Shoe Repair a chance since they are closer to me. Big mistake!!!! Besides being much more expensive they replaced the inside and the heals of my shoes very poorly. I do not recommend that place and i will never go back to that shop again.
2,"I went here with a friend last night after wanting to try this place for some time. It was nice that they are open late (ish... 11pm). I was really excited to try their food after reading all of the rave reviews, but overall, I thought it was just ok. I ordered a birria taco, a carne asada gordito - crispy as recommended by the girl taking my order, and a pollo vampiro. All of this (plus my free chips... thanks Yelp!) cost about 9$, fairly reasonable. The restaurant was busy, with many people waiting to get a table inside due to it being fairly cold outside (though they had heaters going outside making it effectively warmer out there), but we managed to snag a table inside. The food was prepared quickly and with a stop at the salsa bar, we were ready to eat. Unfortunately, the food was sort of a mixed bag. My friend had a bean and cheese burro and said it was amazing. The birria taco was fairly good, the meat was tender and flavorful. The vampiro was decent.... I liked the crispy tortilla, but the meat was nothing special. The gordita was not so good. The shell was incredibly chewy and hard to eat, the flavor was on the burnt side.... the carne asada was fine, but the shell... not so much. I'm not sure if this is how this dish usually tastes or if it was just an off night. The salsas from the salsa bar were all good and tasted fresh. They had many salsas that tasted unlike anything I have ever had before... in a good way. Overall, this place was alright, but I couldn't see myself making a special trip out here to have it again."
4,It is really hard to mess up Chipotle's quality and service and this place does not disappoint.  The same quality food you get from any other Chipotle and the same great service.  This location could get a little crowded due to it being on the Strip and within the outlet mall but they move the line as fast as possible.
3,"Thank goodness for Facebook.  A friend of mine posted a picture of what they got here, which is how I heard about this place.  The picture looked so good, I just had to try it.\n\nToday, I got the smokehouse burger for $6.99. The burger came with provolone cheese, bacon, onions BBQ sauce on a sesame seed bun. You can make it a doublestack for $2.00 more.  Thank goodness I didn't, this burger was huge!  What I loved about it was that it was an explosion of flavors.  Thick cut bacon, sweet BBQ, perfectly carmelized onions and a thick patty.  I added on fries which was really simple yet super good.  I've always had a thing for the shoestring type.  These fries were nice and crispy and had just the right amount of salt.\n\nWith the added fries and a drink my total, with tax, came out to $9.48.  ***If you check in on Yelp, you get 10% off your entire bill.  The girl taking my order was cordial. Nothing amazing. \n\nEast Coast Eats is a nice, quaint place. There's autographed jerseys all over the restaurant and 3 TVs playing sports. I like the dark hardwood floors and cherry wood table combination. Overall, this place is clean and simple.  It wasn't busy but totally understandable as it was a Monday.\n\nEast Coast Eats is your typical Boston pizza joint that happens to serve everything under the sun: calzones, pasta, subs, burgers. I do recommend the smokehouse burger.  Great Sunday grub if you're in the Valle Verde area."
2,"I'm going to have to give this place a three, and that was probably because my expectations were really high and had just gone to XS the night before. Given that this place was so hyped and expensive to build I was expecting a bigger space, or at least crowd control to prevent the shove fest on the dance floor. I was just trying to dance with my girlfriends and was pushed around the whole night. Just couldn't take it and had to leave early. Luckily we didn't have to wait in any of the lines and were taken straight to the elevator to go up."
2,"I'm actually quite sad that the consistency of the food has changed since they became really popular.  At first, I would order delivery for work and it was on time or early.  As the weeks passed, the delivery times got worse.  One order was skipped over so we waited an hour passed our set deilvery request time.  Today, the order is 30 minutes late and counting as I write this review.  \n\nOn top of inconsistent delivery, the last order we did was pretty  bad.  It was as if the food was pretty much dumped into the boxes.  The burgers came tossed around and the tacos were soft and not crunchy.  It wasn't tasting all that great.  When we ate in the next day, it was okay.  I'm crossing my fingers that today's delivery tastes and looks better.\n\nI really hope that the consistency for delivery times and food quality goes up from here.  If not, there's always another burger and taco joint in town."
0,"It's a shame I'm not allowed to leave NO STARS because that is what this joint deserves.  Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe isn't \""golden rule\"" at all because if this group of people came to my place, I'd feed them better and treat them friendlier then they ever did.\n\nAfter the New Times Best of 2011 came out, this place won(!) and  I made note to visit the place soon and  the best it got all night were two female dishwashers, in the parking lot, smoking, who could not have been nicer with their welcome.\n\nBut that, my friend, is as good as it got.  The waitress, and calling her a waitress demeans all perfectly good servers across the valley, she would not get up from her seat at the counter to serve me!  She merely slid the menu across the counter to me and said, in a very unfriendly voice, whaddya havin'?\n\nThe owner sat behind the counter counting his money -- SERIOUSLY -- and bragged to no one listening how he'd seen the same Casino-B Act three times in a day the day before.  Wow.\n\nThe chicken came, it was good.  I paid $21 for a plate of fried chicken, all white meat, black-eyed peas and another memorable side I cannot recall.  They were out of mashed potatos.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF MASHED POTATOES?  OH, WAIT, WATCHING A B-LIST CASINO ACT 3 TIMES IN A DAY MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM KITCHEN PREP DUTIES, NO?!!!!!\n\nI told my friend on the way home what a scam that was.  I said one original recipe whole breast from KFC would be as good or better.  We stopped at the next KFC...and I was right!  $2.47 for one whole breast from KFC vs. $21 --- PER PERSON! -- at Mrs. White's.  STAY WAY AWAY FROM MRS. WHITES!\n\nThis guy, this family should get down on their hands and knees, every night and thank God for Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks and the gentrification of their neighborhood.  It allows, at least, a couple of casino shows per night!\n\nThe sycophants who've written before me must want to misinform you:\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I WASTED MY MONEY FOR YOU!\n\nupdate 1/20/13-a private message from Tony accuses me of racism.  Really?  What did I say here that was racist?  That I didn't like the food?  That's not racist.  That the owner was counting his money?  Again, not racism.  The only thing racist here is Tony.\n\nThe food here is VASTLY OVERRATED!  I'M TELLING YOU, EL POLLO LOCO has better chicken than this DUMP, by FAR!  And you don't have watch an extremely fat waitress refuse to get up...oh, wait.  She can't.  She's too fat."
2,"Its located in a good area, and the patio area is right on eastern, which has a small fountain. The quality of food and coffee is same as their other stores, how ever there are a lot of kids handing out at this location, so it could get loud. There was a family eating  little caesars pizza and it seemed like they had been their for a while taking shelter in the store. \n\nOverall, its a good location if you want to do a quick stop for a coffee and a snack. If you want to eat at the restaurant than go to Panera Breads. Better quality food and drinks."
1,"Great food, awful service, a sandwich takes about 25 min to make. I recommending eating here but call in."
2,"I went into this store today ONLY to get the $2.99 milk special they had. So I naturally assumed that I would be in and out in 10 min or less. However, I get in, get my milk and I'm in line for more than 10 min.  There were 5 people in line and only 1 register open around 3pm. \n\nI efinitely would have thought it would have been a quick trip. Plus there's a CVS across the street that would have similar items. \n\nThere aren't many Walgreens around, so it was convenience only."
1,I enjoy the wings....if I am doing a party of some kind. We use to go here often but staff are clueless on how to treat people. So I go as little as I can. And also when Im not spending my own hard earned cash. I feel I wont pay you to disrespect me. When they lose enough clients they will dish out better attitudes.
1,"First of all - the decor is cool.\nThe food and service? Not so much. Had cashew chicken and sweet and sour chicken and both were quite bland. Had to send the cashew chicken back as it was served lukewarm. Waiter was inattentive and slow - maybe because we didn't order drinks? Have had better Thai food at our local \""hole in the wall\""."
1,"We went here last year a few days after they opened.\n\nIt wasn't the best I've had nor the worst.\n\nI had a calzone which was pretty tasty, but  a bit bland.  \nMy mom's pasta was very bland & boring.\n\nIt is cute inside & the service was decent.\n\nWe haven't gone back since..."
2,"Julius & I have actually traveled to Tokyo's district of Shibuya.  Dubbed the NYC Times Square of Japan, Shibuya is electric, bustling, and sexy, just like its namesake restaurant in Las Vegas.  We've passed by Shibuya many times while walking MGM Grand's Studio Walk, and the scene was always the same: hoards of people crowding the hostess trying the get a table, and the sound of lively chatter coming from the restaurant.  Julius & I swore the next time we had the opportunity, we would come here for sure.  The opportunity struck the weekend we went to Vegas for the Pacquiao-Mosley fight!\n\nROUND 1\nUnfortunately, I can't say the night started off on the right foot.  We arrived early for our reservation, so we requested seats at the sushi bar.  The hostess told us there would be a little wait, so that was cool, until I saw her give the next 2 seats away to a couple of guys that arrived after us.  Low blow!  I TOLD Julius to be the one to talk to her, since he was a guy!  Scorecard:  0 Shibuya\n\nROUND 2\nJulius & I finally got seated, and enjoyed a nice bottle of sake, alternating toasts to Pac-Man as well as our early 10 year wedding anniversary :)  We took in the energetic atmosphere where techno music was playing and everyone around us seemed to be celebrating a special occasion.  What really reminded me of the city of Shibuya was the huge video display covering the entire back wall of the sushi bar (not to mention the wait staff walking around at a brisk pace like they do in Japan!)  The restaurant's party atmosphere was a knockout.  Scorecard:  1 Shibuya.\n\nROUND 3\nWhen we looked at the confusing menu (divided into hot & cold dishes, plus a separate tasting menu), I wasn't super impressed.  I think I was expecting either really eclectic or authentic Japanese fare, but the offerings were pretty standard. I guess it's because this was Vegas, and they had to cater to the masses.  We ordered a salad (a very simple, miso infused salad), oyster sampler (cute presentation of just 4 tiny oysters - you have to have a really refined palate to taste the difference between them!), the soft-shell crab tempura (surprisingly, the batter wasn't a light panko typical of tempura.  Instead, it reminded me more of the thick New Orleans-style batter), and the shishito peppers (delicate and spicy/sweet - probably the best thing of the night!)  So the food was good, but unfortunately, not really memorable (I had to Google the menu to jog my memory!)  Scorecard:  .5 Shibuya.\n\nROUND 4\nExcept for the hostess at the entrance, service was pretty good.   Our server was very attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  What sealed the deal for me was the little treat they presented at the end of our meal - complimentary green tea and chocolate mochi, beautifully plated, with a \""Happy Anniversary\"" message on piece of white chocolate.  Dessert to me is usually the Main Event, so Shibuya was saved by the bell!  Scorecard:  1 Shibuya.  \n\nAfter our meal, we headed out to the MGM Grande Garden Arena to watch Pacquiao beat Mosley (woohoo!) Was Shibuya victorious as well?  Compared to other Japanese restaurants we've been to, not sure if Shibuya's food is a contender.  I think to fully appreciate the place, you have to dine at the Teppanyaki bar.  But if we're judging on ambience and d\u00e9cor, Shibuya is a heavyweight champ.  Final Scorecard:  3 Stars."
2,"Located at El Cortez Hotel and Casino, this place has its ups and downs, but, I say it's OK.  \n\nComing to El Cortez, I did like the fact that parking is free.  El Cortez overall is a nice place and have that old Vegas feel.  Focusing on The Flame Steakhouse, it has a very nice setting as well.  Very well decorated and not to crowded.  I did like the fact that they had a live Piano Player who played through out our stay.  \n\nAs far as the staff goes, they are quick and I did like the fact that some one is there to refill your drinks.  Our waiter who took our order was also nice as well.  Everything was done is a good amount of time to keep me satisfied.  \n\nWhat was a bit unsatisfying was the food portion.  Don't get me wrong, it was nice and great, but probably could of been done better.  Even though the bread that was served was okay.  It seems like they were in a hurry to serve it, that they didn't sliced it all the way.  So when you're trying to get a slice of bread, you're either breaking off the bottom of the slice, or getting the bottom half of the other slice.  As far as the steaks goes, I was not totally impress with it.  It was decent in a way, but when asking your steak to be cooked medium, I don't expect it to look burnt or black.  It looked like they left it on the grill to long.  As expected, it did look a bit over cooked to be a medium.  Our sides of Macaroni and Cheese seems to be covered in burnt cheese as well.  It did look nice and tasted great, but the top layer of cheese was like a blanket, that we have to dig for the macaroni, cause the cheese seems to be too cooked and stuck to the bowl.  But it was decent enough to eat.  Dessert was okay as well, but not much to make it stick out.  \n\nOverall, not highly recommended if you're looking for a steak house.  But a good place to go if you're hungry and don't mind your food to be overcooked, at least you know its cooked.  The place is nice, the service is quick in a timely matter.  I'm sure you'll have a decent time there."
3,"i was so wasted/ exhausted/ starving cuz i didnt eat the night before, so i was starvvvvvinnggg! so i almost fainted right when i got my food !! pho cures all hangovers and fatigue lol \n\ni think this pho place is better than the rest on this street so far. they give you big portions! i always order the number one lol the broth was really good. it didnt seem like it had msg in it cuz my mouth didnt crave for water how it usually does when i eat at other pho places. \n\nme and hubby ordered a side of fried egg rolls, it came with lettuce, cucumbers, and radish... im like what do we do with this. i thought about wrapping the egg rolls with the letuce but wasnt for sure. so the guy came by and told us just wrap it add it all and dip. wow that was pretty good! \n\nyes i will come back again!"
3,"First time visiting the other day.  Good service, awesome wings and rings, and lots of tv's.  I was on lunch break at work so I couldn't drink or let loose, but overall a good bang for your buck. Didn't receive any attitude when we used a coupon either."
4,"I Love this place, from the sushi to the soft robes.  Best Resort in AZ.......no in America.  Escpecially when you get lucky and hit it through Hotwire:)"
4,Awsome to work with...had security film put on our house. They worked quickly and did a great job. They scheduled a time to do the work and showed up promptly.
0,"Their services are overpriced but reasonably consistent, but I still wouldn't recommend them.  They called us almost every day for months, so finally I picked up the phone to their recorded message saying there was a problem with the bill (which there never was).  So, since I wanted to get this pain in the butt settled, I followed instructions to talk to a customer service rep.  Their idea of customer service is a joke.  This woman claimed that the phone number might still be attached to an old account (we've lived here 2 years!), verified the address, phone number, name on the bill, last 4 of the social and then asked my partner to verify since it's in his name.  I put him on the phone, he verified his name and that he wanted the calls to stop, and it should have been done right then and there.  No such luck,  She kept rambling about how he had to get back on the phone to repeat all of the same info I just gave her.  What a lazy bunch of jackasses.  They have all of the info to go look up the record themselves to verify who the number belongs to, but instead choose to keep harassing us for no reason.  As soon as we move, we are done with them."
3,"The unexpected touches are what elevated this from a 3 to a 4 star experience for me. I'd read the reviews, so I already planned on getting a boozy milkshake, skipping the sliders, and ordering the Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado) - all of which were fantastic recommendations. (Thanks Yelp!)\n\nBut I wasn't expecting the complimentary popcorn (that our group quickly renamed crack-corn), nor was I expecting the complimentary nitro meringues to finish off the meal. It was clear that the servers, even on a busy Saturday night, were eager to make our experience memorable. And from start to finish, that's exactly what it was."
3,Best breakfast burritos!! The breakfast burritos hit the spot after a long night shift or in the morning! The establishment is a bit worn but the food is still good. The best part is they are open 24hrs.
3,"The girls here are great, and fun to talk to if you're not creepy or hitting on them!!!  Love the wings, I come with friends every now and then and have a great time."
3,Tried this place again for lunch during the week so I could order off the lunch menu and it was a better experieince. The Beef Bulgogi Bento Box was very good and the price was better than we paid eating here on a weekend.\n\nWill go again but only during the weekday lunch menu.
4,Love little mom and pop joints like this .. Especially when mom and pop make the food! I enjoyed the ground beef sausage type meat and their bread is moist and spongy ... Decent price and the place is  well kept and clean
4,"It looks like I am not alone...I absolutely LOVE this place!  I have purchased many unique items here and stop in every time I am in the neighborhood.  The staff is very helpful - have helped me ship items to my other home in Dallas too.  The merchandise is ever changing and very reasonably priced.  For anyone that loves France or Paris, you must stop in and take yourself away...really feels like you have stepped into an antique store in France."
0,"I was surprised by the size and scope of this store.  They have dive classes and just about everything you could ask for EXCEPT any level of customer service.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day but considering it was my first and apparently last visit they really drop the ball.  I went looking for some bike equipment and possibly a new mountain bike.  3 associates were in that department so I was sure I would get help.... Nope.  20 minutes and not a single acknowledgement I was there.  Considering I needed advice to make a purchase I left empty handed.  My daughter, who wanted the $180 bike, was crushed because I had planned to get it for her but not at that level of service.  As we walked away she asked \""why are we leaving\"" and I responded \""because they obviously don't want my money here.\""  My 4 year understood the concept to bad Sports Chalet did not.  Sadly the clown at Walmart answered my question within 2 minutes.  Beaten by walmart!  What a joke."
3,"Originally I was looking for a restaurant that served chicken katsu and I came across this restaurant even though they don't serve katsu here. It's pricey, but after having buffet food for the past couple of days, I was ready to try an actual restaurant. My sister and I arrived here about 15 minutes before the restaurant closed and we were still waiting for our parents to arrive. I liked how the server gave us a friendly warning that they would stop taking orders by 10:10PM since the kitchen was closing soon. Fair enough since you warned us. Luckily my parents arrived on time for them to order on their own. I wound up ordering a Pork Kurobuta Crisp along with a Crab Dynamite roll. Also ordered an Orange Mojito which was I liked because I could barely taste the alcohol. While I'm not a big fan of crab, it tasted very good. I think my highlight was the desert. I love the Calpico drink so I had to order the Calpico Pannacotta. It tasted just like a cheesecake version of the drink. Very yummy for me. I did feel under dressed with my SF Giants hoodie, but I saw another person there with a Giants sweatshirt too. The wait staff was friendly, asked us how we were doing, and always filled our glasses with water. I wasn't stuffed as I would be after a buffet, but pleasantly full."
1,"I have been buying from, and consigning to, A Second Look, since the 80's, when they opened the first little store on 32nd Street & Thunderbird. They were so good at the business, that it grew into a store the size of a regular department store. Unfortunately, they have gotten very full of themselves and their success, to the point where I can find NEW clothes, bags, and accessories online for a lower price. Also, one must now actually PAY for the privilege of supplying them with their inventory. That's just crazy and greedy. Really too bad. Used to be a fun treasure hunt."
4,Excellent traditional Mayan cuisine! We found this place on Yelp and loved it!! We will definitely come back. The cochinita pibil enchiladas were delicious!!
4,"I really like this place. Not just restaurant they also sell food to cook at home. I tried thr Buffe really nice. My fav: ravioli with penout sauce,the soya brochette,General Tao chicken, steak with pineapple sauce... Almost everything.  Highly recommended. Certainly I will be back"
3,"I loved the experience even though I probably ordered the wrong menu item. I got the curry chicken salad wrap.  It sounded great with chicken, grapes and curry along with a few other ingredients.  It was a bit much curry for me but the next time I may try the shawarma.  All in all it was a terrific experience, they take cards and are really friendly!"
2,"Mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker, eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites! Tons of parking as well! Def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place!"
0,"Damnit! They did it to me again!  I drive in for a simple car wash and end up with more dings on my fenders than Armor All on my tires!  When I brought it up, they dragged nearly every employee on the premises over to my car to take a look. Then one by one they all got Idiot's Amnesia.  Even the bonehead who I watched drive my car up to the conveyor denied he was even in my car! \n\nAs I stood there pointing out the fresh scratches with the paint color that perfectly matched the jagged block wall of their drive path, they all went dumb!\n\nMy first experience with this type of senseless customer service at Danny's was a few years back. A manager was pulling my car up to the drying area at a high rate of speed, and I actually watched him sideswipe another vehicle with my car. When I confronted him, and pointed out the fresh patch of rubber rash on my fender from the hit, he denied it...and guess what? He suddenly got that exact same case of Danny's Family Carwash Idiot's Amnesia. Luckily for me I was able to get the rubber patch off so I didn't need to follow up. \n\nAfter a recent statewide bust for hiring illegal workers -- TWICE -- you'd figure these morons at Danny's would be a little more willing to curb their bad behaviors and be a lot more customer centric. \n\nWhen Danny's Dysfunctional Family Carwash starts offering body and fender repair services along with their mediocre car washes... customers beware!"
2,"Good, unique sandwiches at reasonable prices. I had the Improv, which is like cold Thanksgiving dinner on a baguette: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, lettuce, mayo. The little cookies that come with the sandwiches are fantastic, too. Yes, the sandwiches are pretty stuffed and the fillings often fall out, but better that then an underfilled sandwich that's all bread, like Subway, right?!"
0,"So we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery. Of course they knew they were delivering to a resort maybe some plates or napkins at the very least some plastic forks ect. would have been nice. Now let's move on to the food TERRIBLE!!! No sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered. Seen on here biggest egg rolls around, panda has bigger then this crap. Pork fried rice bland. Even my 9 year old says why is there hardly any filling in the egg roll and she never complains about anything. Portions from Chinese food places are for the most part generous well not at this place. And the prices for the quality and portions is a joke. Could continue with more but think you get the picture. Don't waste your money on this place!"
1,"8/2012 \nI was so excited to come here for an anniversary dinner and try my first Beef Wellington. The new chef from Hell's Kitchen hadn't started yet. The pastry touching the beef was soggy and a doughy blood. Waiter was not attentive and offer to fix dish. I booked reservation 6 months in advance and told them the occasion. The waiter said :\"" anniversary? Happy Anniversary. Would you like to see a dessert menu or just the bill?\"" WTF. I am a huge fan of all of Chef Ramsey's shows but this was a miss. We were all dressed up for the occasion and had people just walking in with shorts without reservations who looked like they had better service. I hope the winning chef turns it around. We had a better steak dinner at the Wynn's steak house overlooking waterfall(name?) where we stayed on a last minute dinner. They even went above and beyond with dessert and treatment when another waiter overheard us talking about our anniversary in two days. Had I known, I would have eaten there instead..."
0,"I went to eat here today for my one hour lunch and the cashier guy was SO RUDE. First he got our order incorrect and instead of egg rolls he gave me some coconut pudding. I asked him if he could refund us the money and he said \""what am i gonna give you for 0.98 cents?\"" I then said can I substitute it for anything he then said again \""for 0.98 cents really?, He then gave it to me. I told him that he needed to reevaluate his customer  service skills because he was not courteous. He then told me \"" Its not my fault that you guys don't speak up and I didn't give you forks because you took the tray before so that's your fault!\"" I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE ! HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE ME HIS NAME THEREFOR HE HAS BEEN RUDE TO OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE!"
4,"I admit that I was a little skeptical when I saw the hole in the wall environment and plastic utensils. But then the food came, and I just kept ordering more. The Hoi Nam chicken rice was authentic and delicious. The curry beef over rice was wonderful. I ordered and enjoyed every dessert on the menu. Oh and then the price: $5 for an entree and $1.25 for dessert. I'm very picky with my Asian food, and this place exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Highly recommended!"
0,"I d like to start off by saying that this used to be a great Hallmark for mailing packages until they hired this gentleman named Mike who runs the back mailing office.\n\n I hardly ever write bad reviews on a place unless I feel there was a major problem that needed addressing, in this case I have to say that Mike is probably the rudest individual I have ever come across.\n\nI needed to mail off a package that was oddly shaped. He overcharged me by almost $80! I thought this was way overpriced so I went home and hopped onto the USPS website, plugged in all the dimensions, weight, height, length, etc right from the receipt Mike had given me... It came out to a mere $39 and change!!! That's a huge difference to! I went back immediately and I asked to speak to his supervisor and he told me she didn' t  like to be bothered, she wasn't there, she's never there! So was he basically telling me he could just do what he wanted back there? \n\nI'm sorry but this person running the mail counter does not know anything, blamed the computer, and is more than likely overcharging customers on a regular basis. I wanted to discuss it with him in a calm manner and he started getting very huffy with me and then told me to leave or he would call security. \n\nI went to a different Hallmark store about 6.5 miles away that handled USPS mail, and they charged me exactly what the website showed the first time.\n\nVery disappointed in this Hallmark and will not be returning. I will also have to tell everyone I know not to go here either. In fact my step-mother had an equally unpleasant run-in with this same clerk about a week later.\n\nIf you don't like customers Mike, then I would recommend a job where you are not required to interact with them!"
1,I went to check it out after my workout at LVAC store was extremely hot and uncomfortable inside. Poor customer service did not  seem interested in helping me. Selection poor and price high . Definitely not worth checking out !!!
2,"Decent food but very very expensive. Try the south Indian food - very good stuff, avoid dosa."
2,This has always been my goto Chipotle and great until recently my online orders were getting messed up. Missing tortillas on the side and guac. Not sure if there has been management changes or something but also  a lot less chips are being given in the bag. $1.30 for 25 chips? Might as well go to the store and buy a whole bag of Tostitos instead. Disappointed in recent experiences here when i order at least once a week :(
1,Great customer service! A few days after I purchased some indoor plants I noticed some big holes in the leaves. I found 3 big caterpillars! Two of them had moved to plants that I already had in my home. I wont be buying any more plants from Star nursery!
4,"Absolutely fantastic! First visited Bouchon in Yountville four years ago and was counting the days until I might return.  My second visit was as good as I remember. Salmon rillette is rich, creamy and wonderful. The trout was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. My husband had the steak frites....crisp fries with a nice sprinkling of salt. And the service was outstanding, making our visit that much better. Cannot wait to return!"
4,"Simply an outstanding dinner. While staying at the Four Seasons we requested a reservation at a good Chinese restaurant. Of the 3 suggestions this one really sounded the best-- and it was. Seating is not overly crowded so you can actually hear a conversation. In addition, the place is located off the casino so you are away from the noise.  We started with the mushroom egg rolls and the moo shoo chicken both exceptional. The egg rolls were thins and crispy with intense flavor and not greasy while the chicken was served in a thin pancake with a robust chicken filling. The sweet and sour soup had a wonderfully playful flavor while the corn soup tasted as fresh as corn on the cob!  Our entrees were the best-- general tsao chicken which was light and overly breaded but all white meat. Incredible. The Kung pao chicken with macadamia nuts packed flavor and a punch at the end.  We asked for it to be spicy and it was but not overpowering. The eggplant was nice but seemed bland compared to the other dishes. By this point we had really had enough so it could have been us. Overall, an excellent choice."
3,"I've been to Red Squirrel twice in as many weeks because of the handy location (very close to Filmhouse, Usher Hall and Traverse), its great menu deals and nice atmosphere. \n\nAdmittedly, I didn't have high hopes the first time I visited the establishment. It's located in a unit on Lothian Road that has had many owners over the last few years and I've never been very enamoured with any of Red Squirrel's predecessors. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pub is well presented, has a good atmosphere and doesn't suffer from a cheap and nasty vibe. \n\nThe menu is good quality pub grub, and there's a great deal on two courses for \u00a310 and three courses for \u00a313 - brilliant! The place is owned by the folk that take care of Holyrood 9A, so there were some great burgers on offer as well as other pub grub staples like mac and cheese, fish and chips and some more unusual items like a \""plank\"" of food to share. \n\nOn my first visit I ordered the veggie haggis burger and then a dessert of sticky toffee pudding. My second visit afforded tomato and basil soup, followed by the veggie haggis burger (again). The portion sizes are very hearty and the staff are pleasant and accommodating. The food is excellent value for money and very tasty. \n\nThere are also some good deals on alcohol and a fab selection of beer. I spied WEST brewery steins of lager on my first visit. \n\nMy only jibe is that burgers are served on wooden trays with grease-proof paper. The grease proof paper quickly gets soggy and rips apart - sometimes sticking to your food - so a minor inconvenience to an otherwise fab dinner. Not too sure why the paper is even there in the first place! \n\nOverall, a worthwhile place to visit in the centre of Edinburgh. Long may Red Squirrel continue."
2,"My wife and I walked in to get new glasses for me.  We ended up spending almost $750 for two sets (me & her). We were ther for awhile but  I had a nice pair of glasses and I was happy. ok 8 mos. go by and one of the little rubber 'templets' breaks. I bring it in and they say' no problem we will replace it FREE you just need to cover shipping ($10). I thought that was excessive and it seemed nonsensical to say it's free. I pushed back and the mgr said; yes that's our policy. I said for 1 rubber templet ? they could drop it in an envelope and put a $0.50 stamp on it. She Said 'They charge us so we charge you'. I reluctantly paid it. They said it may take 2 weeks to get it. Long story short, I called the frames co. in NY. Told him my style of frames and explained the problem. He said  whats your address? I just received them in the mail. Four rubber templets and guess what?.....  wait for it .....  They came 5 days later in an envelope with a $0.50 stamp on it and the company didn't charge me a dime.\n\n PS-- we have three kids and the oldest (11) already has glasses and the other two are right behind her. and of course a friend in Stetson Hills asked me where I got my glasses. I love telling the story. Moral to the story;  the customer is NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. But, The life time value of a customer is worth more than $10. It's way cheaper to keep a customer for life, than it is to acquire a new customer.  When I called back and happened to get the owner on the phone -- \nI told him I wanted to cancel my order for the templets? he was nice and said - come on in and get your $10 credit.  I don't think he had any idea of what happened and I'm sure if he was there when I walked in -- it would've went differently."
3,"Obwohl Glutamat, so ganz habe ich no glutamat eh nicht geglaubt, es schmeckt gut. Es werden frische Zutaten verwendet und die Saucen heben sich doch vom Durchschnitt nach oben ab. Meines Erachtens eine Empfehlung unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung des Preis -Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnisses."
1,"I was shocked to see this place have a five star rating on Yelp.  It must be the owners posting over and over again because there is no way it should be rated that highly.\n\nWe got takeout, thank God, because the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a 7-11.  No offense to the owners, but the dining area floor plan is a mess, complete with garbage bag table cloths and a massive Pepsi machine in the middle of the room.  \n\nI ordered Chef Claudio's Favorite.  The sauce and pasta weren't bad but the ham was basically cold cuts you would get from  Safeway...not what you would expect from a 5 star Yelp restaurant for close to $20.  My wife ordered the Quattro Formaggi, very much overkill on the cheese and had a very chunky consistency and gritty texture.  \n\nAgain, I hate to bash a place but this is a 2 star restaurant and these 5 star reviews are absolute nonsens"
1,"Came here today for the first and last time because of the exaggerated Yelp rating. Let me start off by saying I appreciate what this place is trying to be. However it falls short in so many areas it's almost sad. I used to love going to a deli in Old Town called the Picnic Company (now they did gourmet sandwiches right). I ordered the roast beef and it took 10 minutes (a bit long for me). The sandwich was mediocre at best the roast beef was quality but not the highest quality as the perception of this place would cause one to think. The potato salad was bland and tasteless. Honestly you can make better food at home, don't waste your time or your $9.00."
3,Really enjoyed stopping in here and checking the place out. The owner was super friendly and helpful. We discussed making sausage and the wide variety and selection that he had in his display case. I will certainly be back to check out some boneless rib eye as it looked amazing. I will update once I do.
4,This is a great Subway. The people who work here are so nice and fast and the food is always fresh.
4,"I travel to Montreal every week and this place has become one of my few staples.\n\nThe chicken and fries are fantastic (as most other places in the neighborhood are), and very consistently so.  Not a single person that I have introduced to this place wasn't eager to find another excuse to come back ASAP.\n\nThey only take cash, which is a bummer, but seems pretty standard compared to other places.\n\nYou can actually sit down and order the food like a regular restaurant OR call ahead for a delivery (usually takes about 30-45 min) and pick up. \n\nDining in is great, as you get the Portuguese beer, bread and olives to keep you busy as you wait for your order (grilled calamari is out of this world! but sometimes requires 40min (worth it) to heat up the grill).\n\nThese guys are straight out of Portugal and know what they are doing.  I plan on putting their chicken head to head with Romado's to see who is Montreal's true chicken champion!"
1,"If you want large portions of Chinese food, but not picky on the quality, then you'll like Kitchen Wok. The food lacks flavour. It's all so bland. I got the general Tao chicken and it's a sweet, sticky mess. No veggies to be found. The wonton soup is flavourless. We wanted a substitution on a combo for one meal and they charged an extra dollar for it - in the end, they didn't do the substitution, they gave us the menu combo platter. Found out once we got home.\n\nI've gone a few times as a matter of convenience. Moving forward we will go to Kam Yin down the street."
1,"This place is middle-of-the-road, definitely not four stars (thanks a lot Hotwire).  Plenty of WT and tour groups.  Drunk WT tried to chase my girlfriend on numerous occasions when I wasn't around.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing is you can find $10 BJ tables on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nAnd by BJ I don't mean THAT."
2,"Service - No attention to customer needs, very slow service 3of5. ###\n\nAmbience - Neat N clean nothing extraordinary 4of5. ###\n\nFood chips & salsa was okay not so good 3of5. ### ordered enchilada style burrito was good 3.5of5 ### value - considering taste, food quantity, ambience and service 3.5of5."
4,"Came with a large group we ordered a variety of desserts so we could try all of them and we were impressed. if your a chocolate Lover then this is the place for you. fondue was delicious, the pizza was yum , and not to mention the shakes wow super sweet. will deff be coming back"
2,"This bar is short of another star because of the service. It took a while to get seated, maybe because there was 10 of us. When we got seated, it took a pretty long time for the server to take our orders. My friend and I joked that they are going to get 18% gratuity anyways, hence the crappy service.\n\nOtherwise, the food was great. My friend and I decided to split our meal because we had buffet earlier plus it was already late at night. We ordered the chicken hawai'ian burger; we told the server we were splitting. So when our order arrived, we had separate plates each with our own half of the burger with almost a plate full of the sweet potato fries. So as far as the burger, my friend and I didn't expect it to be really tasty. I was surprised that chicken would taste really good with the sweet sauce that comes with any hawai'ian burger. The sweet potato fries was bomb! I couldn't stop eating them... I was glad my friend and I split the meal because we had the same amount of fries that folks ordered individually."
4,"I would say that this is (so far) my favorite cupcake bakery. They may be a little pricey, but for some reason I felt like it was worth every penny. The cupcakes themselves are a little on the thick side so despite their diminutive nature, is quite filling. Not that they lasted long enough for me to see, but I can imagine them getting a little dry if kept for more than a day. \n\nWhat really won me over was the cream cheese frosting! It is not too sweet and it is nice and fluffy without leaving any oily residue in your mouth the way some buttercreams will. I will probably never know what their secret is but I would describe it as almost a mixture between cream cheese, marshmallow fluff, and heaven? Would recommend to all my friends who can make it out to Vegas."
1,"Service was horrible! We walked up and the hostess just stared at us. So I said \""Good Evening\"" to which she replied \""want a table?\"" \n\nWe then got sat at a table by the bar. So I started thinking about ordering a drink. Never got offered anything from the bar. Never even saw anyone go behind the bar. Maybe its for show. Dunno! \n\nFood was incredible! Lobster ravioli... YUM! \n\nServer seemed liked they could care less if we were there or not. \n\nMight give them a second chance because the food was so delicious!  Hopefully we get better service!"
0,"I am rockabilly to the core.In fact I write and shoot for a national hot rod magazine. So after doing some research I found the pigs and pomps hair salon and I was estatic at the prospect of getting serviced at what I had hoped to be a billy salon. BTW I would like to also mention that I am hardcore butch witha family. Anyways, my partner and I rolled up with our toddler in tow to the pigs and pomps salon on Rainbow. Who knew that what I hoped to be a  hardcore alternative salon would be nestled in the middle of a recently built strip mall in the upper echelon hood.  I was really put off by that but my wife \nneeded an edgey cut and I was in need of a fade. We walked in only to be greeted by the PTA. I was mortified that the only woman working was a frumpy soccerr mom in dowdy non descript tan colored clothes sporting flat blonde hair. She was working on barbie wannabe milf and her teenager daughter. \nWhy cant botox queens just accept that they should age with grace and dignity and never try to look like they're daughter its morally wrong. I digress, all eyes on us the lesbian rockabilly family. Yah know, I get enough crap for being gay and I gotta hold my own in the culture I love which is filled with hardcore badass car and bike guys. So, getting the cold shoulder from the very same people who ruined hot topic was unerving. I should never feel out of place\nin a business whose name would imply that it caters to the billy community. Will i ever go back? Never. First impressions are golden. I wasnt greeted by a spunky 20 something covered in tats with multicolored hair and thats who I expected to be serviced by. Old soccerr moms would screw up my wifes hair and shes gotta know what a five zero is or she will screw up my cut. As a business owner of a place that is alternative you should be choosing your stylists more wisely. The way they look speaks volumes for your company. If you owned susies flower shop and the woman working that day greeted me I would buy flowers from her. But this is a salon named pig and pomps, not susies midlife crisis trying to regain her youth salon. It dosent matter if you employee 49 tattooed employees and this one stylist was fullfilling your EEO qouta. All that matters is that she was the one reprenting your business  that day and is the reason why I and my partner will not be returning. After a lil more digging I see that pigs and pomps caters to more of the  elite upper class society, and that its more of a kitsch trendy title than a mantra. Its sad when an alternative salon sells out to the yuppies.My style isnt a trend its my culture."
4,"Really cute little restaurant tucked away in downtown Scottsdale. Somewhat expensive but great unique dishes, beautiful outdoor seating and wonderful service. Nice wine list too."
2,"Me and my girlfriends went to manicure Mondays. As expected from the other reviews, the line for manicures were pretty long. 60 + mins were out estimated time. We were greeted by a (overly) enthusiastic waitress, and service was on the slow side. \n\nWe tried their wine, martinis, happy hour food, and dessert. Nothing really blew my socks off. It was good, but not like whoa. \n\nI was also totally weirded out that the bathroom had mirrored walls. Who wants to watch themselves pee in the bathroom? I suppose they were going for some kind of contemporary chic, but it doesn't work. It just seems like a bathroom for people to hook up in."
0,The coffee is the same but you should visit the S L O W E S T Starbucks ever! This place takes the award for not being able to take the orders nor care in the world about timing
3,"The Restaurant \""Fix\"" is the kind of restaurant that is designed to perpetuate 'the scene'.. Attractive staff, loud music playing and an open front that faces the casino, right next to the nightclub. It is actually run by The LIGHT Group. They run The Bank Nightclub,Jet Nightclub, Yellowtail Sushi, and a few other night-life spots and restaurants around Las Vegas. It is trendy and LOUD.. with scantily clad female servers and bartenders.. and is normally not the kind of place that I would go for a good meal , but we were there to have a night out on the town so it was perfect. The food was good, the service was good and it really wasn't as expensive as you would expect. I mean.. it was about $80 per person when all was said and done, but that was with 4 cocktails, an appetizer of Lobster Tacos, two entrees and two side items. Not 'everyday' kind of spending.. but i t was quality and I liked it. I had the Kurobuta Porkchop for my dinner, and my friend had the Scallops... good quality on both. \n\nI would go there again for sure.. provided that it was a party-kind-of night.. not for a quiet meal. Good stuff!"
4,"I just adopted a rescue dog from CA and brought him home last night. He came home sort of smelly and dirty and a bit matted. The folks here took great care of Cooper who was a little out of sorts. They didn't keep him all day. I was able to pick him up in less than 2 hours and he was so fresh and clean and didn't look stressed or act funny afterwards. Overall, very excited about the experience since it's close by and convenient for us. We'll be back each month! Great job guys!"
1,"I really wasn't impressed with the Cafe. The service was pretty good and we got a table right away. The decorations were pretty cool- the conveyor belt of Harleys was fun to watch. I ordered a wrap, but it was just ok, nothing special."
3,Food is 5 star and the best I've had so far in Charlotte. The service is 3 star and can use a ton of improvement. No reservations accepted. You can show up and put your name and number on paper. Our wait was long and we were told that it's pretty consistent to have a 45 minute wait. Enjoy.
0,"Dude, this place is beyond bad.  It replaced another sushi place called Katana Sushi that wasn't open long enough for us to try it.  We dropped in for lunch the other day and had the place to ourselves, literally. \nMy wife ordered a very simple roll with tuna, cream cheese and cucumber and I ordered what I thought was beef fried rice (primarily because nothing else on the menu looked appetizing).  Her roll came out resembling nothing akin to tuna and after one bite she refused to touch it saying it tasted \""off\"".  My \""beef fried rice\"" reminded me of something my mom would have tried to pass off to me as \""chinese food\"" when I was 10.  It was like rice and odd beef chunks stewed in ketchup and soy sauce.  I'm serious.  Oh, and a bug crawled out of my salad.  \nA few days ago I passed a guy standing on Cave Creek Rd NORTH of Tatum holding a sign that simply read \""Ari Sushi\"", no arrow, no address.  He was holding it up for drivers that were a block past his restaurant already.  Not sure what institution these folks escaped from but I'd steer clear."
3,"I've been a Wahoo's regular for years. I used to go to the one in West LA at least once a week. About 10 years ago, they opened a location on the strip in the Hawaiian marketplace. Unfortunately, it went bust after only a few months. Luckily, there's a new Wahoo's in town and now I can get my Wahoo's fix. My go-to meal is the Maui bowl - marinated steak with seasoned rice and beans. This particular Wahoo's has gotten it right (tender steak, slightly rare) and gotten it all wrong (beef jerky on rice, anyone?). Your mileage may vary.\n\nThere's a special late night menu at the bar, along with a discount if you're in the hospitality industry. Hey, it sure as hell beats Del Taco at 3 am."
1,Super sad that there is no bakery or roasted duck inside this Ranch 99 location. :( Everything here is WAY overpriced and nothing is sold in bulk here.
4,"Wanna go to Mexico but too broke in this economy to make the trip?  Well then take yourself on over to Huauchinango.  Named after a city in the southern Mexican state of Puebla, you will absolutely feel like you have left the US and gone south of the border.  Unlike most of the \""Mexican\"" restaurants in this city, this one actually has Mexicans as customers.\n\nWhile I have only had the egg, chorizo and potato burrito, I feel comfortable recommending the food across the board.  The burrito is excellent from egg to tortilla to chorizo, very high quality.  And the green salsa is outstanding.   There are fountain drinks, but also a case of Mexican juices and sodas as well.  The menu is written in Spanish with English translation.  The staff is super friendly, English speaking and happy to make recommendations or explain any unfamiliar items.  The environment is low key but clean and comfortable.  \n\nI owe the boyfriend big time for discovering this gem."
2,"My wife and I have been here twice...it's ok. We had wings and a burger and food was pretty decent. Service is extremely slow during a UFC fight, but also during a slow night.  Its your average bar/grill. Nothing special."
0,"I'd have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this one. After reading the great reviews I thought this would be a great place to drop by this afternoon after school. I called and found that the price for a gel manicure was very cheap and with that and the great reviews, I was in! The technician was very nice, but that's probably the only other good thing that I will say about this place. First off it was dirty, not the station where my nails were done but around it. The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it. It looked very run down. Also, the selection of gel polish colors was dismal. Very dismal. They did not have the color that I was looking for (which, I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear. She cleaned up my cuticles alright, but left quite a little bit to be clipped off. But here comes my REAL issue. Filing. The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy. It left them jagged, uneven, rough, and dirty. I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark. She applied the polish and I left. Looking at my nails after, the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger. I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails. I guess you really get what you pay for, which is a real shame. Next time I will stick with my usual place and pay a little more so that I know it will be done right the first time!"
4,"Lots of great modern Italian dishes, great service and a cool atmosphere.  Nice date place for a fun night a little off the beaten path but still close enough to Scottsdale nightlife to walk.\n\nI had drinks and dinner.  Bartender suggested wines for us and let us try some to decide what we wanted.  Band that played after dinner and was really good.  Was there on a Sunday night.  I think they have entertainment Fri, Sat and Sun after dinnertime."
2,"The location of this place is great.  Downtown Chandler is one of my favorites in the phoenix metro area and this is probably one of the most frequented mexican food places in the area.  \n\nThe mexican food here is good, dont get me wrong.  Yet, its not a home run (very few places ive been to in Phoenix are).  The chips came with salsa and bean dip which were good and pretty filling.  \n\nThe chicken I ordered was well cooked and adequately flavored.  However, upon ordering a side of guacamole, I was underwhelmed by the size of the serving they gave.  \n\nSerranos is definitely a good joint.  Lookin for quality food with a great location, this is a good place to start."
0,First of all I gave them 1 star because there is no 0 star!!! I just went there for oil change and car wash. They made me wait for 2 hours and 10 minutes. Should I say something else?? Also I'll make sure that no one goes there!!!!
2,"Wow....this place has changed a lot in the past 8 years.  No longer have the garlic mashed potatoes, use to get the Cobb salad and now it is half the size but more for the money, it seems the portions have gotten smaller and the prices of everything has gone up and the menu options have grown.  There is now pizza on the menu, it would take at least 20 mins to read the menu and that means you are going to be waiting another 20 more mins for an appetizer and then 20 mins for your meal. That is to long to wait for food and plus the time you had to wait for a table."
0,"POOR poor service!!  I came across this company by someone (Keith Kravitz) who writes reviews and he said this is the BEST company to have your grand canyon bus tour with. He stated Excellent Customer Service, what a joke. I haven't tried and will never pay this company for my tour.  They have a phone on the site to call, I called a few times and no answering machine but a recording saying this voicemail box is full and cannot hold too many messages.  Ok, so I decided to email them because I wanted to clarify some things that contradicted Keth Kravitz's reviews, he stated this company is all inclusive with lunch and etc.....But when I looked on the website, it does say \""All inclusive\"" but lunch is not provided. Then of course the first thing came into mind was to call them and clarify. I got fed up with their voicemailing system so I emailed them. This is the response I received:    \n\n\nAlice,\nWe are swamped with tour bookings for tomorrow.  All your answers can be found on our website.  We don't employ a large staff to answer the same questions over and over, which the answers can be found on the website.  If you would like us to answer the phone more, we will have to hire more people and raise our prices.\n\n\nPerhaps our company is just not the right fit for you.  You sound like you need more customer service.  We cater to the independant internet savvy traveller who has no problem using our website.\nGood luck\n\n\nThis is some kind of EXCELLENT Service!!"
0,"Having now got 2 people on my case I thought it would be best to clarify and explain perhaps in more detail.\n\nFirst off, I didn't mean any offense to Cambodian people as a whole and if they are upset I apologize for my tongue in cheek attitude. I don't know any and from this experience I'm not bothered by that in the slightest.\n\nSecondly, the selling off as Cambodian is an inaccurate statement which I'll happily retract here. It would be unfair to both Vietnamese and other Cambodian restaurants. I was more trying to make the point to those that were wondering what Cambodian food was like, that it is very much akin to Vietnamese food. It's not my fault there are more Vietnamese restaurants in the US and probably based on this I can see why.\n\nGenerally I've found that places with a higher yelp rating are harder to get into which makes perfect sense to me. This place was NOT full (about half full when we came in) nor happening despite what the owner says! Funnily enough, he has the cheek to call me a liar?! Insensitive comments - yes. Liar - no. (More on the owner's lying later)\n\nThe poor start relates to that and the poor service which the owner disputes (I have no idea why this fact is disputed). If you have to wait over 5 mins. in a restaurant before contact (not physical contact as the owner oddly suggests) then that's a poor sign. I've only been to 500 places so what would I know?!\n\nThen the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service? Are you kidding me?! That was the funniest comment so far. That comment alone is enough to confirm to me that they have no clue to the meaning of the word service. Bringing out dishes is a given! lol Nothing to do with service - I will say the plates were put down on the table nicely if that's what is being alluded to?\n\nThe owner could just have asked where I'm coming from and I would have gladly responded with my opinion to which I am fully entitled as is the owner. Should probably think about \""customer is always right\"" before launching a senseless tirade/defense of service! Try engaging your customers and explaining things if it is sooooo different?!!!\n\nI'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish? That was funny too.\n\nBut by far the funniest is the comment about the egg roll coming at the end of the meal. Why would say that and then have a picture of the amok fish with an egg roll on yelp?! Yet the owner calls me a liar? Just own up - you forgot, had a bad day whatever. You think lying is going to make your place look better?!\n\nIf I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2.5 stars. Not trying to be generous, I tell it how I see it. I'm glad other people had such an amazing experience but unfortunately we did not. The blame for that must primarily lie with the owner. I'd have thought you would want to satisfy your customers, not like to them!\n\nI give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish. Why wouldn't I compare it? That's how a rating can be generated! You have to know good to know bad, so that to me is the essence of rating a place, by comparing it to others. It's nothing to do with how fancy a place is or not. e.g. a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me, but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4. Lying to the customer gets 1 star.\n\nTo finish (finally!) I apologize for the Cambodian references mentioned earlier, I meant no offense and hope to have cleared those up. However the service was appalling and the food lackluster. That was our experience. Nothing can change that now. Let's see if the owner can come clean or will they have to resort to more petty name calling like they are in the fourth grade!"
3,"Bellagio is quite the fancy hotel and is most known for its fountain that puts on a spectacular water show at regular intervals throughout the day. Most of my trips to Vegas are for my birthday which falls during the month of December and during that time, the hotel has set up their holiday decor including a really fun display that features trees, flowers, water effects, and animatronic animal.\n\nThe overall feel of the hotel is very elegant with artwork displayed everywhere and architecture that is grand in scale and beautifully crafted. The lobby area features a blown glass chandelier that was created by Washington's own Dale Chihuly.\n\nThe Bellagio shops feature a wide area of fancy stores where piles of money can be spent if that's your thing, or you can just sit back and people watch all day both here and on the casino floor. Speaking of dropping lots of cash and casino floors, the Bellagio combines both of these options in to one handy gaming area as well as a very large sports betting area.\n\nMy favorite feature about this hotel is the buffet restaurant that has a ton of great food at a price that's not too bad considering everything that you get."
0,The pretzels taste like cheap white bread. The cheese sauce tastes like velveeta. The decor looks like they put a pushcart vendor indoors.

4,"Great for takeout.  They threw in extras for us, which was a nice touch."
4,"I adore this place, I'm a BIG fan! I have been here 3 times and I have only known about it 3 months! This place is classy and clean! The first time I was there me and my Fiancee sat at the bar ( Which was a gorgeous well stocked bar) we had lunch we both got chicken sandwiches OMG Delicious!  They have the BEST desert! We are big Fans of bread pudding so we got the white chocolate bread pudding! OMG wow! Very good! We were very impressed. The cost for that was like $30.00 it was quite cheap! We received WONDERFUL service. The next time we went was on a Friday evening and we were celebrating my new employment. They had a date night menu which we decided to order off of. The date night menu Included appetizers, two salad, two entrees  and a desert. it also included a drink, or for a little more a bottle of wine. We got the spinach artichoke dip, which was good, we got there WCG salad OMG so good! I had got the prime rib and my fiancee the rotisserie chicken and ribs... All of it was delicious! Then finally desert we did the white chocolate bread pudding becuase it was so good last time! The price was good we spent $58.00 plus tip so it was fairly inexpensive considering all we got. Again Great service and  GOOD food! The last time i went i went with my sister. She loved it, we got the WCG salad and shared a chicken sandwich all oh so good! This time I switched up the desert. We got the white chocolate brownie! oh my it was tasty! I will definitely return! Every time I go good food, great service and its a cool and clean place!"
0,"Quoted to replace parts that were just replaced, plus parts that didnt need to be changed and was told I had a bent torsion bar??? Considering that I am a ASE cert tech and currently working in a dealership, not only was this bad intel but flat out lies. I told a family member to take it there for a quick alignment, this is what I got. This shop I would not let work on my kids bike. Shade tree techs at this shop"
1,"This place was OK. I walked in on a Thursday night and it was just about empty.  The idea of it sounds better than the actual place.\n\nThe outside decor looks kind of neat with all the bottles.\n\nSeated ourselves and eventually the bartender/acting waiter came over to take our orders. \n\nThey have a happy hour which is nice but it was for bottom shelf liquor... I want to spend money on a decent drink, not  a below-average drink that is usually already cheap to begin with.  ATTENTION PATRONS: $4 Drink is now $3 Drink! \n\nI ordered the chicken tenders with what I think was their house Ranch. My boyfriend ordered fries and something else...\n\nI didn't like any of the two entrees nor the appetizer from this place. \n(Tasted stale and over breaded) \n\nDefinitely Skip this place if you are hungry and want some good food."
1,"For a Sheraton this is not the greatest.  The rooms are outdated, but more sickening is the skirt on the bed had visible stains.  Hello!  The people who clean can see it, why don't they remove it.  Many complaints we heard in the hotel, noise level is one.  Loud... people walking through the hallways are rude and loud after hours!  Doors slamming next door sound like they are coming in your room.  The only reason this location I can think gets the business is that they are in a great area, close to the stadiums and great dining."
2,"It you want cheap (by Vegas standards), convenient food with good people watching, this is your place. But, do not expect the food to be flavorful or the usual quality you would get for the price. \n\nI ordered a standard margherita pizza ($14) and a caprese bloody mary ($10). I was happy with both, especially the bloody mary. It was bloody awesome!\n\nMy friend ordered the linguine vongole ($25, linguine with steamed clams) and was very unhappy with it. She said it had no flavor and was not worth the price. Perhaps sticking with simple dishes and keeping your standards low is the best strategy at this restaurant.\n\nThe service was fine. Nothing special, but not sub-par either. For the price, convenience, and people watching, this restaurant suited my needs. \n\nIn response to an earlier review, I had a drink in hand coming into the restaurant and the hostess said nothing about it. \n\nMy final comment is that Caesar's Palace has many fountains paying tribute to the famous Trevi Fountain (including the fountain outside this restaurant), however this fountain was clearly not built in the time of Caesar. Beware of these and other historical inaccuracies in the theming of the palace!"
0,"I have been punishing myself going to this place for years because my friends go there to watch football. Today, was the last time, ever! Walked into the bar area and waited for 15 minutes before I finally flagged the bartender down. Then we she walked over she gives me attitude, I wasn't the one talking to my coworkers ignoring everyone at the bar, why should I get attitude? I told her I wanted to order something off of the breakfast menu and she informed me they stop serving at 12:00 (it was 12:08) so I replied,  \""if she had asked me what I wanted to order  when I came in it would have been before noon.\"" Her reply'\"" I guess, I can go ask them if they can still make something.\"" She returned about 5 minutes later and said if I ordered immediately  they would do it, so I did.\n About 5 minutes past that, the manager came up to me and told me \""Sorry, they had just thrown all the breakfast away.\"" Customer service at its' finest, let me tell ya ! It's not like she doesn't know me, its' not like I'm some grease ball who doesn't tip, I actually over tip. \n I think it's telling as you read these reviews, you pretty much get the same subject through all of them, good food, good facilities, TERRIBLE SERVICE !  If I were the management or ownership of this bar I'd be reading these reviews, because your staff just lost my business !\n\nOnly reason it is getting one star is because the review won't post without it !"
4,"Fantastic!! I've driven by this place a few times planning to stop by one day and I finally did! Great food, had the chicken souvlaki pita and salad, it was amazing. The pita was delicious and the salad was perfect size with lots of topping and fresh cold lettuce. Staff was awesome, the girl running the front counter was really friendly and incredibly efficient. Kudos to the staff, I'll be back!"
2,"Wasn't impressed this time around... \n\nThe mahi tacos were ok, but lacked any type of seasoning on the fish. The Bellini (that is supposed to be one of their popular drinks) wasn't good to me at all. Reminded me of sickening sweet cough syrup...\n\nThe service was good, we were always taken care of. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu since the atmosphere is usually very inviting."
0,"Staff has no product knowledge and needs to be trained.\n\nReceipt has no return/exchange policy printed on it. \n\nPhone number on the receipt is wrong. You will have to look up the correct phone number on their website if you would like to contact this store location. \n\nAside from not knowing anything about their products, associates are dishonest and will sell you an open box product without explaining or even mentioning it to you. \n\nI would give zero but let's face it. Location is great. You get to take selfies and will be able to use their PC for FB, IG while waiting for your pictures to print. Polaroid is polaroid, it sells itself. They just need a new team or re-train their team to represent their brand."
3,"I have to update and upgrade my review because I've found Marshalls to be a great place to go for children's books, toys, and clothes!  When the children's books go on clearance, you could easily get them for $1 or $2 each.  Normally priced, I'd say the books sell for at least 30% less than retail.  As far as the children's clothes are concerned, I have found some of the same items at Costco for the same price, so it would be a toss up on where you'd rather buy those from.  But in either case, they are significantly cheaper than retail, probably by almost half.  Kids go through everything so quickly, so this is a great place to get name brand stuff for less."
0,Waited for over an hour and a half then finally  told the chef was no longer seating anyone!  Boo!
1,"My eyes saw philly cheesesteak, my stomach growled yes, then my legs took me there. A mindless decision on my part.\n\nA hint of buyer's remorse trickled up upon checking in on Yelp, then came in a raging torrent of disappointment after taking the first bite. Never knew it was possible to have such bland food. There was no flavor in the bread, meat, onions, or peppers at all, not even in the hot sauce that I added! Were they allergic to salt and spices?\n\nI swear I didn't know better, but now I do."
1,"I would not bother going here for dinner again.  I was here for lunch and (although overpriced) the food was good.  I had a friend in from out of town and we met here for dinner.  I arrived early, and the bartender was GREAT - gave me happy hour pricing on a drink, double checked the reservation!  There was NO ONE at the hostess stand, so I just walked in.  Once we were seated for dinner, the waiter brought over bread - very stale, tough to chew with no butter, margarine, olive oil, or anything to spread.  The menu was quite limited from and entree perspective, and everything was ala carte.  That would have been OK, if the quality of the food had made up for it.  It didn't....very average food, pricey, and service was quite bad."
1,Have been to this place many times. Would visit it twice a week. Such a regular that the server already knew my order. Last time I was there I found a worm in my soup. All they did was offer an apology and that's it. Even though I did not even eat half of my food they still made me pay for it. It's unfortunate that the food is good but treatment to loyal customers is so bad.
3,"Debating on 3 or 4 stars here but we did really enjoy our stay, a few things though were off putting.\n$4 mini water bottle in the hotel room, no thanks.\nAlso no thanks to the $12 WIFI offered.\nParking that needs to be validated every time you leave or else pay to park, annoying.\nOther than that, big, clean rooms, descent bars and dining options, great shark tank pool, good location right on Fremont Street which was a great change from always being on the strip.\nService was so so. \nNeeded a late check out, they tried to give me a hard time, then gave in.\nNeeded my two nights stay split up in two bills, again first a hassle, then I got it.\nWe paid around $50 a night which is a great deal, especially considering the entrance to the pool when not staying at the hotel is $30.\nHad a great time here and would have no hesitations coming back again!"
4,"Octane Raceway was wonderful! I was planning a surprise party for the fiance and Octane Raceway was the perfect place to have it. He had always wanted to go high speed kart racing and I knew it would be a blast for our friends too. I had an elaborate surprise that I wanted to go perfectly, and with the help of Nicki, I was able to book a great room (called the Morracco Room) where Eric could be surprised by all of his friends and family. I blindfolded and earmuffed Eric and brought him into the room where he was surprised with people (after I accidentally led him straight into the door lol) and then proceeded to play a video I had put together of friends and family's birthday wishes that couldn't be there because they were across the country. The video played perfectly in the Monacco Room (video and sound were awesome)and the surprise ending to the video was that I flew out his favorite cousin from Florida! We then all checked in, watched the safety video and did 2 races each. The races are pretty long around 12-14 laps each and every moment was intense and adrenaline filled! It's so much fun taking corners and turns super fast and drifting through. We all got really into it and competative which was the most fun! They email you the race results which is pretty cool! They have food and a bar so we got a little pizza and beers. You aren't supposed to really be drinking too much but they don't breathalize you unless you are acting a fool! We will definitely be returning and are even considering becoming members!"
4,"The wings here are EXCELLENT!! They are crunchy, saucy, & spicy!! Had the spicy chicken sandwich too, that was also good as well as the seasoned fries :) Have the wings, they are a must! We sat at the bar to eat & the bartender was awesome. he gave us great conversation and attentive service :)"
3,"Can't Find a record shop? \nThats because theirs only a handful in the AZ area.  LWR has weathered the storm over the years when downloading has crushed local music stores.  The selection is more for  House, Trance, Drum & Bass and more.  Not so much hip hop.  \n\nServices, turntable repair, and mixer repair. Personally I don't know of any other place that does this."
3,"Great value for a hot toasted sandwich!  Great for lunch, even better after a night of partying - it's open 24 hours!\n\nReally enjoyed the original - tender, pink roast beef with cheddar and creamy mild horseradish.  \n\nWalk-up and order - for $5.99 you won't be disappointed.  I love how all the sandwiches are priced the same."
0,Ok I will start by saying I still use this airline because I can't afford not to use them.  I'm an MD Anderson patient that usually flys to Houston from Las Vegas weekly for treatment.  I have missed treatments because of being 4 hours late.  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't always have a reason to blame it on something or someone other than themselves.  Sometimes the staff is great and other times they are like drill instructors.  One time we were on the tar Mac for 3 hours waiting for a gate.  Another time in the airport waiting for a crew for 7 hours.  The customer service is non existent.
2,"I came here for a massage and had a Groupon for an 60 minute massage. The massage was great, but I was not pleased that they ripped me off by not massaging for the full 60 minutes. Just because I have a Groupon, doesn't mean you have the right to cut corners and reduce the amount of time that the voucher said... ($90 value). Other than that, massage was great, but I wasn't about to ask for the full sixty minutes after they already took me out of the room and I realized the 60 minutes hasn't been fulfilled yet. A customer should never have to ask to get what the paid for."
3,"What a cool and odd place!!  The service was wonderful, the people - staff and customers were  fun and friendly!! \n\nI went original - with the Oggie and loved it!! Their red wine sauce - YUM! \nI wanted a few more sides of it, but controlled myself!  Although when I asked for a take-home box, the waitress asked if i'd like more sauce!!!! whooo hooo - heck YES i want more sauce!!\n\nMy date had the Mexican -- pasty.  It was nice and spicy!! Interesting to have a mexican flavored irish pocket / sandwich - but hey, it works!!\n\nGo give 'em a try -- it's a different type of place and all in a great way!"
1,"My #1 gripe with this place is the prices they charge.  $10 for your run of the mill sandwich - no side dishes or drinks or anything.  How many meal deals could I get at Subway for 10 bucks?! Because they don't taste much better...\n\nTheir menu listed \""gourmet hot chocolate\"" and since this place looked like a cute little cafe, I was expecting something at least on-par with Starbucks mediocre version. Not even close. It was a powdered mix and hot water!! Bleh.  Thankfully for me, the girl didn't make it correctly (uhhh?) the first time around, but I told her not to worry about it once I knew it was just Nesquick and water.  The coffee was also boring. They forgot the avocado on both of our sandwiches.  2 boring sandwiches and 2 boring coffees cost  us $27. \n\nWalking around their property is lovely and we snuck some bites of fresh pecans off their trees!  But, I was extra disappointed when I strolled by Morning Glory Cafe and saw that their prices were cheaper than my  sandwich! I would have much rather eaten there and I think I will in the future because the area is so beautiful. \n\nI would love to visit The Farm again, but will never eat at The Kitchen again."
3,"I spotted Melon's the other day while I was driving down Rainbow and made a mental note to try them out for lunch someday. Today was that day.\n\nI had the Red Rockin' smoothie, which was a combination of raspberries, bananas, granola, cranberry juice, raspberry sherbert and fat free vanilla yogurt. I decided to pair that with a Ham Turkey & Swiss Panini, which came with potato salad. Total was right around $10. \n\nThe smoothie was really good, not too sweet and the granola gave it a unique flavor that I enjoyed. My coworker ordered the Pomb-Bomb  smoothie (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, pomegranate juice and fat free vanilla yogurt) and let me try it. We both agreed it was too sweet for our liking. \n\nThe panini was delicious. The parmesan crust bread was a little greasy but not overboard. I really liked the garlic mayo. And the potato salad was just how I liked it too... Not too creamy, nice and yellow from the mustard. \n\nFinal verdict: Glad I saw this place the other day. I definitely plan on trying some of the other items on their menu."
3,"I went to the shop at 2.35 today and asked the (only) guy if the lunch specials were for to-go too. He told me I was too late. I told him the menu states till 3pm. He reluctantly agreed to take my order. When I read him the dish I wanted, he told me to tell him the number. After a while, he started making phone calls. I suspected his cooks have gone off for a break. 10 min later, his mexican cooks came back and started cooking. \n\nI had chicken rice and curry chicken with rice. The curry chicken (no.2) was quite nice. Not spicy. Good deal for the price."
0,"Very Dissatisfied. I just called to order from the online menu and they don't make what we ordered (3 items)anymore. I understand restaurants change up menus, but please update you site accordingly as well. Additionally, if your going to have someone answer the phone, make sure they know how to talk."
4,"The Vulture Mine is all about Arizona history.  A miner named Henry Wickenburg discovered an outcrop of gold ore in 1863.  Get your timeline out and plot, \""American Civil War,\""  then look up \""Apache Wars, Geronimo,\"" then find when the silver strike was made that began the silver and copper mines of Globe and Miami.  Finally, pinpoint the \""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  \n\nA well-known employee of the Vulture Mine was Jacob Waltz, known as \""The Lost Dutchman.\""  He may have helped himself to a little Vulture Mine gold, later found in a box stored under his bed.  When the weather is good, you can sit in local Apache Junction Cafes and sometimes hear Dutchman Mine finders coaching Dutchman Mine Seekers.  With maps\n\nHow about Disneyland?  When you take the mine car ride, you get a look at \""The Glory Hole.\""  The original was created by a Vulture Mine cave-in.  \n\nThe once-booming mining town of Vulture City is long gone.  A town named Wickenburg grew up 12 miles away.  But you can go to the site of Henry Wickenburg's mine and step back into Arizona history.  Especially late in spring when the mine's about to close for the season, the temperature's 104 and you're museum-ing in an 1890-era uninsulated frame office with no A/C.  \n\nThere are tours, there are mining relics to see.  You can buy little bags of Vulture Mine ore-dirt and a gold pan, take 'em home, maybe strike it rich yourself.      \n\nIf you like history and its remnants, you'll like the Vulture Mine."
2,"Show was ok.  Not worth the money we paid though.  I would spend my money on other Cirque shows (I love Mystere) but this was real disappointing. First thing that disappointed me was our seats. We sat at the top but only the 2nd row so you should be able to see everything just fine, but you can't. Anything done in the front of the stage I could never see.  There was a preshow with some clowns that I couldn't even see at all. And during the show they go to the front of the stage off and on and then again I didn't even get to see what was happening. One thing that made it hard to see is the row in front of us (the 1st row up top) they would often lean forward so they could see and then it really blocked our view.  The show was slow, there was about 2 acts I enjoyed.  They have a few clown acts during the show, and it was so slow and not funny at all. I don't think anyone was laughing at all.  Other shows I have seen I don't want the show to end, but this one I kept hoping it was the last act so we could go and do something fun."
0,"Went to one of their recent warehouse sales. No prices on anything. We were told to make an offer because they really, really wanted to get rid of it all.   My friend handed  Penny the money   for an item and she said  she couldn't sell it because it didn't have all its parts.  Well, my friend didn't  need the extra parts.  If what he offered wasn't enough, why didn't she just say so? She didn't attempt to help find them.    Just took it away. What followed was  an awkward pregnant pause and we simply left.     On the way out my friend saw that she put the item  in a box marked with her name on it. Was she keeping the items for herself or her shop and not giving anything to the customers for whom she was conducting the sale? Something's rotten in Denmark..... or Charlotte. I would never go back to the store or one of their sales.  I hate dishonesty and deceit."
4,"My son tried this restaurant once and wanted to take me (and a friend). We arrived, and the hostess recognized him and welcomed him like a long lost friend. The rest of the staff was just as terrific. The food was the best BBQ I have ever had in a restaurant. Our entrees were the spareribs, baby back ribs and the brisket sandwich. Huge portions! All of the ribs were very meaty, excellently spiced, and delicious. Our sides included the mac and cheese (excellent), the corn muffins (addictive), and the fries. I loved the kale and cashew salad!  We tried the pork bellies and grits as an appetizer. Amazing! Very creative dessert menu! The best was that our server Les took us back through the kitchen to see the smoker. Got to meet the owner- very fun and appreciated!  Our server has an extensive restaurant background and it showed. We will definitely be consistent customers."
2,"More 3.5 than 3.  Went with a living social coupon, so I got to order lots of things to cover the 20.  Had the turkey pesto mozzarella crepe, and i must say, it was excellent. The  staff recommended it, and it did not disappoint.  I appreciated that he was more excited about recommending it than me ordering it.  Also ordered a vanilla scone, and it was pretty good as well.  I drank a  mocha, which I didn't find that special, hence minus 1 star.  the other star deduction was for the crazy heat inside...they don't have ac.  However, I'll say that their food is pretty solid...and, when the weather eventually cools a little, that star will go up.  \n\nI also had a machaca crepe. That was really good. The pico de gallo had amazing flavor and spice...much better than 95% of the Mexican restaurants I've been to in Phoenix."
0,"Horrible experience is a nice way to put it. I waited for four hours to see a doctor because the irresponsible front desk lady, Maria, misplaced my file. I had to ask FOUR times when I was going to be seen, and finally someone decided to look for my file. All the while I had to listen to the lady that took insurance talk about her \""baby daddy\"" and all other ridiculous conversations she was LOUDLY having. Never ever ever will I come here again"
4,I can't say enough about how the guys at Digital Insight saved the day and my budget!  They printed my son's 5th birthday party Comic Book invites in one day and they turned out awesome. More importantly the cost was within my budget. I highly recommend them for your printing needs....I know I will be from now on!  Thanks again for helping me out!
0,"Worst strip club I've even been to.\nWas in Vegas past weekend of my boy's bachelor party. We reserve a VIP package online and pre-paid. The best part of the entire Sapphire experience...the limo bus ride over there, driver was awesome. Some girls from our hotel were on their way over there too and danced on the pole in the bus for us. Sadly, they were much better than the actual strippers in Sapphire. We got there got our reserved table, no view of the stage at all (so starting off bad already). Waitress was nice and apologetic the entire time. Less than 5 minutes into sitting get approached by an asian stripper (not even close to attractive), No small talk, tried to grab my wallet out of pants and said I want to use your credit card. No bueno on that. So she got lost when we told her to please leave us alone. Some actually attractive girls showed up to give us lap dances. Usually the strip clubs I've been too nationwide (MIA, NYC, LA, ATL) the girls have some small talk, over here the same 3 questions in less than 2 minutes for all of them (What's your name? Where are you from? Do you want a dance?) After the dance they're gone faster than anything ever. There's so many girls here and so many patrons, you would think they would spend some more time with out after to try to get more from you. Instead, they do their dance and then go hang out with each other. So hour in now after a few dances and 3 drinks in (all of us used up our drink cards with the 3 drinks...makes no sense...must be really pricey drinks). The manager comes over to us and tells us we need to leave our table since at that moment none of us had a drink in hand. Forget the dances we were getting. So we all ordered another round. That bought us 20 minutes. He came back up to us and told us to leave the table. No where else to sit in the club, only standing room. So we said forget this and left the club. \n\nI feel bad for my buddy as he was angry after told to leave our table. Pretty much ruined the part of his party. Luckily he said everything else more than made up for this crappy place."
2,The juice was great. I had a large size of Berry Bom Pomp (or something like that..lol) and a Veggie Masala Burger. It was great and fresh. I paid about $20. It was quite pricy for a burger and a drink. I might go back if I really want to find a comfort food with a very comfort place without concern about the price. \n\nThe environment was very cozy. They have quite lots of books and novels to read. You can sit and read the books in there with a hot coffee and cookies:). Hmm...very nice.
2,"Stopped in this place for an 8:30 AM Breakfast. We would've grabbed a quick pastry and coffee that day, but the 2 places that had this right next door had super long lines, so we opted for the sit down breakfast. It was a little expensive for 2 breakfasts and coffee. But I will say the side potatoes that came with the eggs were awesome!\n\nOverall, it was ok, just a little overpriced."
1,"I'm lost for words. I continue to go here because I have that Flock card. I get coffee about once maybe twice a day from here. It's close to my classes and I like the atmosphere for doing a bit of work. First, I think the food is way overpriced for their quality: sandwiches are soggy and blah and they use blah deli meat. As for the coffee... I don't know what to say. It's caffeinated. Sure. Other than... I avoid getting the espresso drinks (cappuccinos, lattes, etc.) because all of them taste the same, foam or no foam, and are super milky rather than decadent and creamy. The drink craftsmanship is nil. They, like everything else there, are overpriced for their quality. The coffee here isn't brewed to the point of acidity as Starbucks' always is, but it ranks fairly low in taste. Maybe Seattle has spoiled me. I do recommend the cold press though."

0,"Apparently, there is a niche for a proper promotions company in Las Vegas because the Light Group is downright worthless. Any venue that has hired this group of incompetent individuals may want to reevaluate their contract before the Light Group ruins their image for good. \n\nI have never dealt with such sheisters and frauds in one place. \nA group of lovely females wanted to spend a typical Vegas Saturday evening at HAZE and was in contact with a promoter from the Light Group that had no idea to what he was doing. Two girls showed up just as the others were walking up to the line (me being one of them). My friend and I had different VIP tickets than they had, but were told because of that, we needed to pay $20 each. The promoter guy said \""that's not right, I'll be back\"" and proceeded to run up the stairs to talk to the table handing the tickets out. While we waited for him, only to receive a disappointing answer - not surprising - that he couldn't do anything... we said \""F-it and paid $20.\"" We paid the 1st- level \""Rope Man\"" who also happened to take my ticket (he said his name was Andrew but is total BS). We then got to another rope, which let us in and then got to a door man at the entrance who said I needed a ticket. I kindly told him that the man at the first rope took my ticket and my $20. And he told me \""no, you give your ticket to me and you pay money at the counter. Nobody over there should have taken your money.\"" So I try to get back and tell the guy at the rope that I needed my ticket, because clearly he was trying to steal the money, only to be stopped by the 2nd rope man saying I cannot cross the rope. The short spikey haired dueshlord promoter came over and asked what the problem was and I told him the situation. He tried to say that I have my ticket and that I paid HIM the $20. By this point, I'm getting so frustrated. I said \""All I need is an effing ticket, I don't care about the money, just give me a ticket so I can go in with my girlfriends and have a good time!!\"" Then the first rope man came over and denied that he took my money AND my ticket. Another promoter came over and handed me the same ticket I initially had. He proceeded to tell me... \""you didn't pay $20 to get in... you paid $20 to cut the line.\"" I was outraged because THERE WAS NO LINE TO BE CUT!!!! There was a very short line that I would have happily stood in if it meant getting 1.5 drinks inside the club. Then as the other guy was walking me in, the first rope man yells out \""you are going to let that liar inside?!?!\"" \n\nI was SHOCKED!!!!! Knowing some high level executives at Aria, my irate text messages started blasting. I love Aria, but HAZE was a hot mess. \n\nAs we were leaving, someone had asked us if we had a good night. My friend blurted out \""no, HAZE was awful\"" and the employee was actually the one who said that HAZE was run by the Lightgroup and it's always a mess. As we continued to share our horrible experience with others (locals) throughout the weekend, they too, were familiar with their awful reputation. \n\nLightgroup is a FRAUD so work with someone that has legitimate pull for your Vegas experience."
0,"We tried Uncle Bears again after getting an email from the Manager telling us things had change.  We showed up prior to the football games starting today just me and my three kids.  We were hoping to grab an early lunch and watch a game. Unfortunately, no waiter or waitress ever showed up.  Watched 5 service personnel pass by no one ever asked us a question offered us service nothing.  The place was dead, the games hadn't started but apparently we were not interesting enough.  When we got up to leave the same hostess who sat us told us \""Thanks for coming\"".  She just sat us 15 minutes ago and nothing triggered in her mind that wow, they are leaving soon.  I told her thanks for the continued bad service we will be sure and never come back.  Don't go here, we have tried the place several times, the service never gets better.  Go to Blue 32 its a little out of the way but far better service and food."

4,"Took my car here to get an amp and a sub woofer installed, price was perfect, I shopped around other places, but everyone was crazy ridiculous prices, I left a message for James for exactly what I wanted, he told me a price, and it was way lower than every other shop. Took my car in, they said it would take a couple hours which I was ok with, they told me instead of sitting around, they could offer me a ride home, or bring my car back when they were ready to get started, so we did that, as soon as they were ready, I got a phone call letting me know. When they got started, I got a call within a few min letting me know the amp I had was missing a couple cables, they offered to install everything and when I could get the cables, bring it back and they would hook up the amp. They offered me a good deal on another amp as well, after a few minutes of trying to locate the parts, I went with the new amp, even then the price with the new amp was still lower than every other installer or install place.  When I got the car back, it sounded awesome!!!!!  James sat and talked with us for a while, we asked about other installs, and I will definitely be going back to get more work done. I recommend this place for fairness,  great prices and overall friendlyness. It right behind car wash at country club and Guadalupe."
1,"The TeePee is a mystery, Of what you ask? The mystery is, Why do people still come here?\n\nThe food is average, the margaritas are average, the service is average. The only thing I can say they excel at is the noise level.\n\nThere are a hell of a lot better places to get Mexican in Phoenix. I will forgive you if you chose this place over Macayo's or Garcia's, it is a step up from there."
0,"My wife and I just returned from Montreal where we purchased  a Greyline guided tours.  We boarded the bus near our hotel in Old Montreal near the Museum. The first bus we boarded the audio was so bad we could not understand very much of what the Guide was saying.  In fact we really couldn't tell when they were speaking French or English.  Since the purchase spanned 2 days we decided to take the tour again the next day.  We boarded the bus near the Museum again.  The second bus was the fully enclosed bus where the driver was also the guide.  He had a hoarse throat and basically couldn't talk above a whisper.  We requested he raise the volume but nothing helped.  My wife and I struggled to hear but finally exited that bus at Notre Dame Cathedral and walked back to our hotel.  This was our experience with the Greyline in Montreal.  Two failed tours.  When all our friends ask us about our trip to Montreal, we will talk about the great food and the Botanical Gardens and the two failed Greyline Tours.  We will probably tell them to skip the tours, save their money and just walk the Old City."
0,After spending $65 to get in we rode all 5 rides we could and decided to have lunch. After spending $25 for drinks and snacks as we are walking away from the cashier window my 2 year old split her cheaply made Styrofoam cup trying to pick it up in front of the cashier who refused to replace it but I could purchase another at full price $4.... seriously? I will not be back....
3,"It's been many, many years since I walked down a city street with a helium balloon on a string, but Mattress Factory Art Museum let me to do just that.  Sometimes you just have sing like no one is listening and bob down the street with your balloon like no one's watching...or pointing...or taking pictures of the freak.\n\nHusband is not the *biggest* art museum fan (tho I'm slowly chipping away at him), so I was over-the-moon when he turned to me with a big grin on his face after paying a visit to the MFAM and announced how much he loved the place.  And for the AD/HD-afflicted gent that he is, MFAM's installation art exhibits are perfect.  They allow for you to walk through, participate, operate, or touch just about all of them, drawing you in and literally making you part of the art.\n\nMFAM's two galleries -- the former Stearns & Foster mattress factory on Sampsonia and a row home a couple blocks away on Monterey -- house a small but powerful collection.  The permanent collection includes transsexual and drug addicted Greer Lankton's sensory stimulating \""It's All about ME, Not You\""; double mirrored-rooms plastered with polka dots that invite you to dance or make silly faces by Yayoi Kusama; and the sensory *depriving*, pitch black art of James Turrell, punctuated unexpectedly by colored light.  \n\nFor its temporary exhibits, MFAM brings artists from all over the world to Pittsburgh, sets them up in their very own artists' residences, and gives them free reign over their own gallery space in one of the museum's two buildings.  The result is thrilling (Jeremy Ficca's hovering floorboards), amusing (Gill Wildman's \""House Says\"", in which he stenciled cheeky phrases and sayings all over the walls, doors, and even the exterior of 1414 Monterey), and poignant, like \""Wish Exchange Dandelion\"" by Ling He.  Enter the room full of crystal-colored balloons dangling ribbon tails from the ceiling and realize the ribbons are covered with the hopes and dreams of patrons who've come before you: \""I wish my sister could stop doing drugs,\"" \""I want my son to be happy and healthy,\"" \""I hope Obama wins in 2012\""...write your own wish on a balloon's ribbon and leave it behind; but only if you take someone else's with you.  I left my dream behind and took, \""I wish I was artistic\"" with me on our walk back through the Mexican War Streets and Allegheny Commons.\n\nMFAM (and its insanely awesome, hip & trendy, arty-farty gift shop) is a place that will bring out your kid-at-heart."
3,"I have spent a week at this resort off the beaten path of the strip. It is a well kept facility which reminded me much more of a beach destination style hotel than a vegas style hotel. But it is a timeshare and that is kewl as well.\n\nIt's a fun place to lounge around at. There is a decent casino next door (I won a few hundred bucks at craps there). Large parking lot that surrounds the entire complex with multiple trees and a city road that is on the south edge of the property providing much easier access to all of the buildings.\n\nThey had multiple bbq pits with picnic tables on grassy areas making for a fun family or group bbq set up. Definitely a great way to save a few $$$ while in Las Vegas! Very Very important IMHO.\n\nThe rooms were filled with modern d\u00e9cor a real sized small kitchen with all the basic items that you need (pots pans, utensils, plates, glasses, etc). The sofa and chairs were all in good repair and the room was spotless. The view (at least from the higher up rooms) was awesome! The bed was comfortable and they had all the needed accoutrements for the bathroom.\n\nOverall it was a great place to stay, but it reminded me how slow this city gets when it's not the weekend. It's completely different, almost like a dormant volcano that blows every Friday night.\n\nRegardless, I really enjoyed staying here, except that you are so far from everything that most people go to las vegas for! Argh!!!"
4,First time there in years and my daughter loved it! She loved how the lights were everywhere and especially the express train. I also liked how you can take pictures with santa. Everyone was friendly and helpful there too! we will definitly be returning next year :)
3,"Cool vibe and decor, the BBQ smell as you walk in is a bit overwhelming, but the food lives up to it! Nice variety of beers...and the Bootlegger Burger is just crazy good. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had here in Phx .\nThe bacon sprinkled chocolate cake is a must try as well.\n32nd and Shea has been a desert wasteland for good food, but thanks to this place and a few other new additions, you can skip McDs and Subway and have something worth eating and returning for."
3,"I really like the cool space in AiRia, DJ always play great music and I highly impressed with the good service from their security that allow me and my group to sit at VIP cause they appreciate us came early at Friday when they just open. But seriously, I need to SIT! This place doesn't have a place to sit at all if you don't open a table! I wish they could develop the bench or the a cool place in the bar for sitting.. that would be awesome.."
4,"I had given up on it for a bit, but we gave in and tried it again last night...and I have to say everything was delicious.  :)\n\nMuch happier this time around, hopefully the consistency is there because we will try them again soon."
2,I work in the corporate galleria center so its convenant for me to jst run upstairs and grab something quick. I love there chicken tequila spiked soup and there chef salad. Although it is a bit pricey. All the staff there are friendly.
3,"Had a really good experience here. The menu is kind of all over the place with meal prices starting around $7 and going over $30 per plate. It's a steakhouse that is decorated like a sports bar!?!  The food was good and even though I was with a large group, the service was great. I don't think there were any mistakes on our order and we always had beverages in front of us. I don't see myself rushing back here but would eat here again."
0,"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone."

2,"Been wanting to try this place for a while since it changed ownership.  Went for karaoke on Saturday night.  The place is only open until 1am.  Drinks are expensive.  Service was really good.  Didn't try the food but it looked like normal bar food.  Karaoke was fun, nice host.  Would go back due to location."
3,"Came here on Saturday night just after 9pm and it was packed! We (4 of us) had to put our names down and wait for a table so we waited at the bar. Even though it was packed, service at the bar was quick and friendly (say hi to Apple!). 35-40mins later we finally got our table. We ordered the Mo Betta Beef Headwhich (O-M-G so tasty! so full meat! nom nom nom), 20 garlic parm wings (very parm-y, large wings - so if you're eating these as an app for 1, get the smallest amount), perogies (they were good but I like pan-fried better....these tasted like phyllo wrappings), and hot peppers (also very good! and very spicy). We shared everything so we can get a taste of different things on their menu. Table service was fast & efficient. No problems at all at this place. I'd def come back here for the Mo Betta Beef again!\n\nThen if you have some room left in you; you can go upstairs to their \""beer store\"" which consists of many types of beers that you can mix & match. If you get a 6-pack, you get $12 off the total price. Plus if you ate at the restaurant I think you get another 5-10% off. Seriously.  (I love America!)"
4,"Fantastic customer service at lunch today.  Host was nice,  waiter very friendly and even met the manager.  Chicken with feta and spinach was great and the asparagus was perfectly cooked. Loved everything!"
3,"I have been here many times for spring break with my family. It's a great hotel, very cozy, offers breakfast every morning which is great."
4,"From the minute you walk in the door this is a first class experience.  Ok, so it's in a strip mall but so was my favorite Italian restaurant in Jersey where I grew up.  From the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff to the food I could not say one bad thing.  WIne list was thoughtful and fairly priced, food was well prepared and elegantly presented and the energy and ambience are upbeat and real.  If you haven't tried it yet : go!"
0,"Omg don't get me started on this campus.... It is sooooooooooooooo bad! \nThe staff here are students, which is cool...but I could've sworn I was speaking a different language. They had no clue what I was talking about when I asked to speak to an Academic Advisor! Yikes! How do you not know what an advisor is and you're a college student! I asked where financial aid was located and the girl gave me directions in broken English and had major attitude! Super unprofessional! They let their workers listen to their iPods or read, which I guess it nice , but when your employees think that what they're doing is more important than helping someone, it then becomes a problem! Leaving this review is probably a waste of time because the workers here just act like they don't care about anything ! Such a terrible campus, not to mention the depressing vibe! Hate this campus with a passion!!!!!"
0,"I'm with Tony C. on this one. It's cool cause it's cheap and you leave full, but if you go to any other BBQ place it's like that. To me, the BBQ was greasy and nasty. Believe me, I was paying for it later. Just don't see how anyone could rate this up there with any \""mom and pop\"" BBQ place. It's blasphemy!"
2,"A girlfriend and I stopped by this morning *8/13/14* to chat and check out this cafe as we heard it was good. The interior has a cool ambiance with paintings for sale on the wall, and the comfy chairs were a nice touch by the front. My chai latte was pretty foamy but tasted OK- and my friend liked her mocha drink and plain croissant - but unfortunately the service was less than stellar. The male staff member at the register did not greet us, did not smile, and spoke so low that my friend had to ask twice about how much her drink total was. I'm not sure if he was tired or maybe just a bit socially awkward, but he did not give us satisfactory customer service nor was he friendly. The ONLY reason why I am giving this place 3 stars and not 2 is because the female barista was friendly and greeted us with a big smile when she brought us our drinks. I would return in the future, but not if that male barista is serving us."
2,"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They're so popular that all the tables were full and there are always people waiting to be seated. There was a very large Pakistani (I'm assuming) family taking up half the restaurant. I took that as a good sign.\n\nSamosas were tasty. The mango and strawberry lassi were good, but I have had better mango. I really enjoyed my chicken makhani. I believe my boyfriend got lamb curry, but I can't remember exactly.\n\nMy complaints are about accommodation and the fish tank. The tank needed to be desperately cleaned. They have a lentil bowl for $6. I asked if I could get a smaller portion, like an appetizer, for maybe $4 but was told no. She didn't even ask the owner, who was there.\n\nAfter our visit I read in the paper that there were 9 food violations. The food was really good but I'll be checking an updated violation check before visiting again."
2,"Is \""ok\"" but we live too far away for just \""ok\"".  Pizza had nice flavor, crust bit chewy, not crisp in the middle and mushrooms not great.   Full bar but cocktail could be better.  Dessert menu looks great.  Decent neighborhood place that got overhyped by our yelp brethren."
4,"I had my birthday dinner here last night. I was in a group of about 17 people and I had made reservations ahead of time. They gave us our own room, so I didn't really get a glimpse of the entire restaurant.\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. One of my friends was even able to order only broccoli tempura. The staff was really nice and would come in occasionally to make sure everything was alright. They did forget about one or two of our orders, but they really made up for it all in service. \n\nThis is definitely my new favorite sushi place!"
1,"I wish I can give it 2.5 stars but the 2 would suffice.  First of all it took them  about 10 minutes to seat me and I was single.  Another single came after me and he was seated right away.  They eventually put me at the bar.  So I had a great view of the ice blocks.  That also meant the counter would be cold.\n\nI did the build your burger, tots and a flight of shakes.  Brioche roll, medium rare burger, pepper jack cheese, applewood bacon and a fried egg.  I also order a flight of 3 shakes, Captin crunch, double chocolate, and an espresso.\n\nWhen the order arrived it looked really good.  I couldn't wait to get in to the burger.  Two things were already wrong.  The burger was cooked medium well.  it was grey inside no pink at all.  The yolk in the egg was cooked solid.  It was dry some flavor nothing to brag about.\n\nI actually like fatburger better."
0,"Even if you get FREE tickets throw them in the trash...better yet...BURN THEM so there is no chance someone will find them and use them.  Definitely don't give them to anyone...Friends don't let friends go to Blueman Group!!!!!!  Ok...a little of why I feel this way.  This was the cheapest, cheesiest, most unprofessional \""show\"" (I use the word \""show\"" very loosely) I've ever seen. About half way through I actually felt like I was ripped off and had money stolen from me!!!!  There is no way the hotel doesn't realize that this is a terrible waste of theater space but allows it to draw in SUCKERS based on its history and past popularity.  SHAME ON THEM!!!!!  Do the right thing Monte Carlo and let this show die the death it deserves. \nOn to the show. The first thing that struck me was the lighting.  It was WAY too bright and pointed right at the audience.  It was annoying and made us wince.  It was uncomfortable to look at the stage.  Then came the \""tricks\"". One guy threw colored gum balls into the mouth of another guy 10 feet away and then he spit colored water onto a paint canvas.  \""WOW\""... NOT!!!!!  He also missed half of them.  Then he turned and threw marshmallows into the mouth of the other guy who was about 10' away.  This was A LITTLE more impressive since he ended up taking 20 or so into his mouth (missing more than he should also)and then \""coughed up\"" a tower of gooey marshmallows then put it into one of the \""audience member\"" purse.  At this point I thought I was watching the kids version of this \""show\"" even though it was the 10 pm show. It gets worse from here.  They \""pretend\"" to put a camera down the throat of an \""audience member\"".  An \""audience member\"" that had a BLUE TOUNGE and some BLUE make up residue on his neck.  These losers don't even put the effort in to conceal this stuff...along with watching them do wardrobe changes behind the props.  The \""effects\"" were so cheap and cheesy.  I wouldn't dare add \""special\"" in front of \""effects\"".  The only parts I laughed at was the pre-show where they put some funny things about audience members on an electric sign and then one \""skit\"" where they brought up a \""possible real audience member\"".  The skit itself was stupid revolving around the bluemen apparently discovering Twinkies.  It was very childish and unfunny but her reactions \""seamed\"" to be genuine and funny.  There were more nonsensical skits where my girlfriend and I looked at each other asking what the hell was funny about that or what message were they trying to send. Then they played the pipes but in my option the sound was pre-recorded. You could hear the drum sticks hitting the \""cardboard\"" pipes but they BLASTED thumping sounds from the speakers.  I won't waste any more of my time with any of the other \""skits\"" but I thought I was at a high school \""comedy\"" show.  Then the end came (thank god!!!)  Large helium balls dropped from the ceiling and toilet paper shot into the audience (HUH?????) while they did their signature water drum playing. (for maybe a whole 2 minutes!!!!) The audience hit the balls into the air like a beach ball at a rock concert while the ushers gathered up the toilet paper from the isles and THREW IT BACK ON TO THE AUDIENCE.  WTF????????????????????   I will never set foot into the Monte Carlo again (unless it's to get my money back).  BTW...on top of all that the tickets said 10pm, the schedule said 10pm, my e-mail confirmation said 10pm but when we checked in at 9:25 they said they moved to show to 9:30 so we should \""go right in\"".  WTF???????  Oh...and the theater was half empty.  For good reason I now see.  DON'T GO AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS NOT TO GO!!!!!!!!"
4,"Hands down the best taco experience I've ever had and this is coming from someone that's born and raised in Los Angeles. Anyone outside of Vegas visiting needs to come here as it is worth the drive off the strip! Asada, barbacoa and carnitas were ridiculously moist with loads of flavor! Can't go wrong with tacos or a burrito but you're better off getting tacos as you can try more than one meat to find your weapon of choice.  And save room for an Elote/corn on the cob!!!!"
4,"Wooooo hooo.  I love dairy queen, and this is my fave location.  I go here for the drive thru since it's pretty quick.  Even better, they saw my little dachshund with me and gave her a puppy bowl of ice cream :)  She ate it all and is happy.  My cookie dough blizzard was great."
1,"It costs nearly \u00a312.\n\nIt isn't a proper distillery.\n\nThere's no information availabe here that you can't find by going onto Wikipedia and typing in \""whisky\"".\n\nDon't be a mug."
3,"So there is that good ole' saying that you get what you pay for right? Well in this case I ended up only needing a hotel for an extra night while staying in Vegas and didn't want to pay anything over $100 just for less than 24hrs. I use the Orbitz mobile app and first hotel that popped up was the stratosphere for $29 a night! What a steal because after being a bit apprehensive to book this room do to the area of the strip it's located in, I got past that and gave this place the benefit of doubt. Sure enough when i checked into my room it actually was a pleasant surprise! WOW it had to have been in the renovated tower (Central) because the hallways were clean, free of that nasty smoke smell and the room was your basic over night room. If you need a quick place to crash for a crazy cheap price consider this place!"
2,"Located right on the corner of St Viateur and St Laurent, the exterior of this bar on a busy night is very inviting. Popped by with a  few friends and got seated in a corner booth which was nice. Drinks were fine and apparently food was ok but I didn't try any. Reason for three stars? The music was super loud (because the speakers were right above our heads), and it was *REALLY* hot (fans not working that night). So, drinks + heat + girls in nice dresses with their hair done + not being able to hear each other = a meh experience. Nights like this remind me of why I don't like these kinds of places :p. when I go out with friends, the goal is usually to catch up and so hearing them is usually of importance.. But to each their own I guess :p"
0,Went in last Sat afternoon about 3:45.  They open at 3pm but there was nobody except me and my friend and a couple at the bar.  Dining room was all torn up so we could not sit there.  We waited 45 minutes to order some food.  Bartender said they didn't know where the cook went to and kept calling.  After 45 min wait we decided to go somewhere else.  Will try it once again in a few weeks and if its the same will write it off my list of downtown restaurantsthat I want to try.
4,I love Verde! I've been coming here since the day they opened and will never go anywhere else. They use all organic hair products including the hair color andy hair has never felt so good. Everyone is super friendly too!
2,"Years ago, this was my favorite sushi spot. It's moved down that list a ways, mostly because my tastes have branched out. Decent quality food but it seems like some combinations of the same 5 things are used in every roll."
0,"This company is a complete joke, total bait and switch. I booked our airport transportation 9 days ago (for service in a few weeks) & received confirmation.  It was their advertised $45 limo to hotel service, yet they sent an updated confirmation today for $100?!!! I emailed to question it only to be told that they were sold out and booked us with a \""sister\"" company.  For TWICE what I booked it for???  I asked them to honor it or cancel is and I would leave negative feedback, clearly they don't care about customer service."
1,"Went there because I'm new in town and  I'm a chicken wing, pizza and gyro connoisseur.  They have all 3 there.   I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was flabbergasted.  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though, the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously, 10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder, was it really worth it for him to lose that business, AND future business?  \n\nAs I was driving home, I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic, the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.\n\nI may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back, and just around the corner, and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot, but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.  Not just that, buy my roommate and I tend to eat out at the same place.  The guy definitely needs better business sense and customer service appreciation.\n\n3 stars for the gryo\n1 star for the blue cheese charge"
0,"Sometimes you have to be careful with whom you eat lunch.  We were thinking about burgers, and I suggested the best burger joint I'm aware of in Phoenix, The Grind.  But nobody wanted to spend $15 on a burger.  The driver of the car made an executive decision to go to Boston's, but it was too late - the car was already moving!\n\nSo, we arrive at Boston's.  I've already had their pizza, and it was uninspiring.  After you've had pizza in New York and Chicago, and even local joints like Pizzeria Bianco, and you have places like Spinato's in your rotation, an uninspiring pizza is not really even worth eating for lunch.\n\nI started with the Mountain Dew to drink.  It was awful.  Coworker across the table said the Arnold Palmer wasn't very good, either.  Bad drinks - strike one.\n\nI went with the jalapeno and onion straws burger, cooked medium.  But wait, they cook everything medium-well, according to the server!\n\nOut comes my burger and fries.  I discovered that our waitress wasn't being entirely truthful about the burger temperature; they don't cook burgers medium well, but hockey puck.  These burgers are what you get when you accidentally leave it on the grill for two hours too long.  I suspect the restaurant staff, before opening, completes such preparatory tasks as hooking up the hoses on the soda fountain, wiping down the tables, setting up the chairs, and putting the burgers on the grill.  I wasn't too worried about spilling my drink because I had a nice, absorbent meat patty to soak up the moisture.  I could go on and on about those burgers...\n\nAnd you have to love freezer fries.  Tastes just like home, at least if you're a bachelor like myself, and cooking consists of pulling something out of the freezer and heating it up.\n\nOne of my coworkers smartly pointed out that it's nice not having to worry about getting your hands wet holding your burger.  I pointed out that it's kind of nice not having to worry about your taste buds getting too excited.  Another nice, positive spin I put on the meal was that it would make the boring drudgery of the work day seem that much more exciting by comparison.\n\nAnd finally, I lobbed my most viciously backhanded compliment on the place - the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, if you will - by pointing out how nice it is that we saved a whole $3 by not going to The Grind.  \n\nI will admit, it is nice to have dining experience like this every now and then.  It keeps things in perspective.  Because how else will you be able to truly appreciate a good, or even an average, meal?"
1,"Tres sal\u00e9, plut\u00f4t cher et bien ordinaire.\n\nNous y sommes all\u00e9s pour le lunch un vendredi.

Poulet \u00e9tait pas mal, juteux mais sal\u00e9, les l\u00e9gumes \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s (!) croquants et un peu fade, les frites molles (yuk), et la sauce je la qualifierais de saumure, personne ne l'a touch\u00e9. Les verres d'eau se sont vid\u00e9s plut\u00f4t rapidement...  Mayo sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sortie directement du pot (c'est pourtant pas dure de faire un mayo maison, ou m\u00eame juste ajouter un peu de jus de citron).\n\nPas de caf\u00e9 ou dessert avec la table d'h\u00f4te. Bi\u00e8re en fut: seulement des m\u00e9diocres produits Rickards (avec toutes les supers micro brasseries aux alentours, \u00e7a me tue). Le pire, 7.50$ pour une pinte de bi\u00e8re moche - plus que 2x le prix du resto d'\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, et eux ils ont un bon choix!.  Espresso 3.50$!\n\nConclusion, un lunch \u00e0 oublier pour 35$+.  Verdict unanime, aucun de nous cinq y retournera."
0,After waiting a long period of time for some bagel sandwiches and spending nearly $20 for just 2 orders they manage to forget my sides even though we asked numerous times. And we even asked can we just purchase the sandwiches only and they said no it comes with sides.. well so much for that!! Waste of money and I didn't even go back because they would of probably taken another 20 mins just to get my sides!!

4,"So we've tried several greek spots here in Las Vegas in search of our \""go to\"" Greek food spot. We decided to give this place a try after seeing awesome pics on Yelp! Everything looked yummy, so we were really crossing our fingers that it wasn't too good to be true.  \n\nWe absolutely LOVED everything! The place was clean and decorated in white and blue which reminded us of Greece. Cute little spot in a strip mall. \n\nOur server was nice and brought our food in it's respective time. There's nothing I dislike the most than bad timing. We ordered hummus; something I always look for: warm pita bread! They had it!! We had the time to enjoy it before getting our gyros as the main entree. Presentation was beautiful, clean and absolutely delicious. \n\nWe are definitely going back since we now found our GO TO Greek spot!"
2,Pretty darn good.  Tasted like an expensive restaurant burger but for a lot less.  Cashier is friendly.  Cook is fast.
4,When I go to this place..I can't help...I always eat so much..lol\nMeat and vegetables are really fresh and I like their sauces too.\nI didn't know what Sukiyaki is..until I tried those...It was soooooo tasty and something new.\nI had event there last time and had family dinner couple of times..\nEveryone looked so happy with what they ordered.\nSome ppl don't think Shabu Shabu is good because you have to cook your meat with boiled water but once you try...you won't think that way at all..It is really tasty with sauce they give you and really healthy too :)\nIf you're really really not sure about Shabu Shabu..then you should try Sukiyaki...it is awsome taste!!!\nI always can't decide what to get so end up order one Sukiyaki and one Shabu Shabu..that way you can try both taste.\nThis place is my favorite place!!can't wait to go back there again :)
2,Probably deserves more of a 3.5 rating. \n\nThe food was generally really good but because of my fabulous steak dinner at the palms the night before I wasn't as impressed as I should have been. The sushi was tasty but not the best I've had (especially at this price range). My favorite thing was the udon soup which was subtly flavorful but considering how many other things we ordered - this shouldn't be my favorite dish of the night.\n\nA beautiful restaurant but the service was a bit slow for us and despite having over 2 hours to dine there we ended up rushing our meal and skipping ordering further and jumping to the McDonalds to fill us up pre-Vegas drinking.
1,"Was seated right away, this was nice, but then waited for 8 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there.\n\nDisappointed with the service and quality and quantity of food.  Been a while since eating here and the portion sizes have become smaller.  We ordered the Supreme Pizza, they said it would feed 3 easily-if you are a muchkin!.\n\nWe had a waiter in training, someone should have trained his trainer.  After asking her not to take the salad, she did anyway.  That was part of my dinner.  All she could say was oh- really oh!\n\nMain course came out in stages and we had to wait to eat so it was all there.  Family style dining, I like, but the main course should be brought out together.\n\nExpressed my dislike for the calamari - only to be ignored.\n\nWe had to ask for our beverages 3 times before they brought all of them.\n\nOverall, the trainee, was kind and as attentive as he knew how to be.  But will not go back."
1,"Hadn't been in a long time so went back to see Chihuly in the Garden, and remembered why I wasn't impressed the first time around. On the plus side it is very well maintained. But for me it was too much so. I think I saw as many little placards describing every plant as I saw plants. It feels far more like an exhibit to me than an honest garden of any kind.\n\nI liked the diversity of Arizona regions they have on display, and there is some nice historical information, but overall for far less money you can get out and experience some of the great trails all around our state. Take the time and see it for real instead of in a plant-zoo."
1,"Nothing great, but if it is the only place near your hotel, worth a short walk.  They do not have almond milk, only soy.  The espresso is good, but the drink was tepid and prepared very quickly (there was a long line).  I would assume under different circumstances (not CES), this would be a better stop.  Overall an average experience.  They did have food and smoothies, but there wasn't much vegan fare."
0,"We visited a few years ago and were unimpressed.  We decided to give it a try again this year and were again disappointed.  Everything from a rude hostess to bad service topped with food that was mediocre at best.  The fried zucchini was doused with oil, the bruscetta was soggy, the sides were overpowered with what tasted like pre-jarred garlic. We were a group of 12 and not one of us was satisfied. Once the dinner was over, we waited at least 20 minutes for dessert to arrive with all incorrect coffee orders.  Certainly not what we expected on Christmas Eve."
1,"I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.  \n\nTo be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told \""of course, we aren't THAT restaurant\"".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.\n\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same. \n\nI ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.\n\nThe entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \""ok\"".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding. \n\nThe owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park."
0,"OMG! I should have checked out yelp review before booking!  It's 1am in the morning and we spent 5 hours in traffic today to get here.  Im so upset that i cant sleep and have to sincerely warning ppl not to book here. \n\nEvery bad review here are true:\n*Long registration line\n*Bad customer service \n\nWe checked in at 10pm tonight, front desk checked us in to a room that's not what I booked for!  Until I got the key and I notice it said \""Story tower\"" and I remember I booked \""World tower\"". So I returned to front desk and ask if they gave me by mistake, THEN they told us \""World\"" is already booked up! (Wrong #1:you should have acknowledge us prior to giving us the room) and then try to hard sell us that \""Story\"" has more amenities and it's in cool NY loft style.  Okay,  we don't want to be the trouble maker so even I know I didn't like Story style when I booked online already, we thought to take a look.  Jezzz...this is a joke! ..it's so bad that I find its hard to believe this is a famous SLS hotel and I even can't believe I'm in Las Vegas!  This is the worst worst worst hotel ever! THE ROOM IS SUPER SMALL! It's all cheaply furnished! Even my dorm room from 10 years ago is better.  We cannot live with it so we go back down to front desk and request room change.  Finally we got a room at \""World\"".  The decorations is nice and is what I expected,  so we started to settle in, after I naked for shower, then I found out there is NO hot water, see my review in pictures below on FB."
1,"Alright, so I paid a good $40 dollars (including tip) of my hard earned money to eat here cause I've heard so much about it. My parents told me I needed to go because the food and selections are just incredible. After the longest half-hour of my life waiting in line, and apparently that's a shorter wait. It was after 7pm so thankfully most the tourists already ate.\n\nThe selections are alright, I've seen better. The taste wasn't that great. I was extremely disappointed with that! I've been to a better buffet down in Vegas, and that's at Rio.\n\nAlthough, I'll give it to my waiter, and cooks behind the food - they were very, very friendly.\nOh, but here's a negative. I'm not even sure if it's the only bathroom in there, it would be ridiculous if there was. But I believe I remember only 3 STALLS IN THE BATHROOM!? You're kidding rght????\n\nNo, I would never come here again. People create such a hype for no reason at all."
4,Wade and Ron are true professionals. My pool was built on time and exactly how we planned. Great family run business!!
0,"I really want to give this place a 3 strikes and you're out chance, but after getting sick after both times so far, i'm done with this place."
1,"I took in a large garbage bag full of clothes and brand new skiing outfit. They didn't purchase anything. The majority of the stuff I took in was in good conditon, classic style, and name brand stuff. I even had a dress with the tags still attached. I asked why they didn't buy anything and the buyer in training said that the condition they were in and the style wasn't what they were looking for. I saw some of the clothes they did have and it was in worse condition than my stuff."
1,"2.5 Stars is my rating for this Restaurant.\nWas staying at the resort for a coference and choices of where to eat were limited so I assumed this restaurant would be top noch as it was one of the only restaurant opens on the resort.\nNo so my fellow yelpers, not so.\nThe staff (particularlly the waitress) was amazing! She deserves 5 stars.\nThe food was just okay, felt like I have gotten everything better else where.\nThe salmon was okay, a little over cooked and the buger was just okay. \nI have nothing more constructive to add then JUST OK."
4,"Very good homemade food, guacamole is bomb!! Kinda cold inside but good makes up for it"
2,Stopped by to have a drink and some snacks with my husband such a beautiful place we love the music and the atmosphere waitress very nice we tried the quesadillas which we really enjoyed the chips were good too then it came down to the drinks I tried the long island iced tea hmm no bueno tasted like cheap liquor then I went for an apple martini omg no Bueno it felt like I was drinking syrup so I returned both drinks the part that I like the most is that the manager came to see if there was anything that he could do and that is a plus in my book overall we will definitely come back .
2,"Rooms are nothing special, however, we did have a killer view.... \nThe miracle mile walk could kill you if the Valet is too busy and you decide to walk with your luggage though the Miracle Mile Shops!!! \nThe bathrooms in the room is pretty nice, The tub is wonderful!!!\n\nThe Casino is really nice, but not one of my favorite parts of this casino is their buffet!!! Its soooooooooooooo good!!!... Perfect breakfast and Lunch... never been there for dinner, but will be back to try it... \n\nI don't think I would want to stay here again, but will be back for the casino and the food!"
0,"My dad was in town to celebrate his birthday & I thought this would be a really fun place to bring him one afternoon for dessert.  As we walked in we were told to seat ourselves.  As we sat down a server came with menus & my mom told him that we were just here for dessert.  He gave a little sigh of annoyance & said he would be back to take our order.  He came by & dropped off 2 waters (um, there's 4 of us.) We just shrugged it off & ordered. My mom ordered a sundae, my dad, husband & I ordered floats. He dropped them off & we never saw him again. He was actually ignoring us. I was so embarrassed that I picked this place! The floats were just okay, very artificial tasting.  We finally went up to the front & the cashier asked where our ticket was, we explained we didn't have one so she also gave us a sigh of annoyance & went to find our server. Well excuse us for spending $30 on ice cream! You'd think with those prices the service would be much better. We'll take our money somewhere else next time."
4,"My go to for after work... I work very close and have to hide my face because I prefer this food to the kind I serve haha, the people who work here are always so sweet and polite. Portions are a little small, but still pretty good."
4,Went to see this doctor today and glad I chose him out of so many doctors in Yelp. This was due mostly to other Yelp reviews. The practice is very clean and the reception n nurse are very nice and friendly. Had a little wait but not their fault...had to wait for insurance to approve change of primary care physician.\nDr. Sharma is a very nice and thoughtful doctor. He took the time to discuss my visit n to explain everything that was at issue...very sincere and patient...the office was a little busy but did not have to wait long like at other practices where the appointments are always overbooked. Will bring my kids here but knock on wood. lol.\nA really good find and thanks to earlier reviews by other Yelpers.
1,"I signed up for a yelp account just for this restaurant...If you are looking for fast, friendly, quality service you have come to the wrong place.  I have given this place try after try but consistently find myself disappointed when I walk out the door.  If you are looking for a beer selection they have a decent one, but nothing else deserves your attention.  Pizza is the LAST thing you should desire when entering Revolution.  Two stars base solely on the beers on tap.  I believe most of the high marks for this place involve a night of alcohol and a fuzzy remembrance of how bad it actually was!"
4,Better than Starbucks!  Staff is so happy even when 108 degrees and order taking outside (to speed up drive-through time).
1,"Came after reading great reviews and incredible looking pictures of their meals. Very strange atmosphere, seems incomplete.\nWater definitely tastes strange.\nService was quick, no complaints there, prices were reasonable.\n\nNo pork, no duck, no wonton soup.  Out of all of them which is strange. No beer \""might have some next week\"". \n\nI got the mu-shu chicken and seafood rice cake, dan dan noodles and Kung Pow Chicken.\n\nDan Dan noodles were okay, large portion, definitely something to share. Seafood was good, not great.. Looked incredibly but not much flavor and the shrimp were very overcooked and tough.\nMu-shu chicken was actually very good, despite looking bland. Kung Pow chicken remained relatively untouched after the first taste, had some very unusual flavors that shouldn't have been there.\n\nAlso note, a lot of flies in this music-less restaurant and a lonely old plastic Christmas tree sat in the middle of what is a small warehouse space.\n\nWouldn't recommend this place to a friend looking for Chinese food... Or an accurate menu."
4,"Who can pass up delicious popcorn in out-of-this-world flavors? Certainly not me. So, I figured I would share during this holiday season and get some of the variety packs of cups and bags ordered online (since I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area) and pass them out as gifts. The box arrived and I was excited but noticed that I was missing one of the 6 variety cups. I contacted them and really would have been happy with just the one missing cup being sent but they went above and beyond and sent me a whole new 6 cups!  I guess that means more to share with people and hopefully get them hooked on Popped too. Wow, now that is customer service that goes into the stratosphere.\n\nAnd the next time I'm in Vegas, you can bet I'll be stopping by for more delicious goodness from Popped!"
2,"Great service!\n\nThey have mostly bluebunny ice cream, but a few flavors of Thrifty brand ice cream as well! My sister and I went mainly for Thrifty flavors since they don't have thrifty ice cream where we live! Experience was good but wish they had more of the thrifty brands!"
1,"My girlfriend and I tried this place because we had a groupon for $40. Unfortunately everything is just a little bit over priced. Not a lot of value here. The food wasn't terrible, although it was kind of bland. We shared the Fajitas for Two. We also got some margaritas and chips/queso for an appetizer. I was surprised at how little we got for $40.\n\nThe margaritas were good, best part of the dinner. The queso was $6 and was nothing special at all. Just cheese. The sizzling steak/chicken Fajitas were ok but they didn't include very many bell peppers, just a lot of onions. The chichken was decent, the steak didn't look very appetizing and it was pretty chewy. Overall I probably wouldn't go back, mostly because it's too expensive for what you get. If it was a little cheaper I might've considered returning. Going to try Popo's, I've heard it's very good."
3,"I love Pier 1, they have some of the cutest xmas decorations at all different price points.  This year I got some adorable ornaments and then some other decor for my end tables, and I had to restrain myself from just piling more into my basket.  There regular merchandise is really nice as well, and they have some great looking, but priceyish furniture."
2,"I feel a little bad giving it a 3 star because I really enjoyed the overall experience of the place. The service would probably inch it up to 3.5, but I feel 4 stars isn't what this place deserved.\n\nUpon entry, my party of 2 was ignored for the first 10 minutes. Mind you, there were no seats available so we would've waited anyway, though I would've appreciated if we were acknowledged when we entered.\n\nWhen we finally got a seat, service was swift and efficient, with Kayla being an energetic and funny waitress. I ordered the French Skillet with whole wheat toast and sunny side up eggs (I hate scrambled). The order arrived in about 15 minutes; about right for a diner like this.\n\nThe food was decent, but not what I'd call \""out of this world\"". The eggs and toast were good, however the skillet itself seemed to lack something. There wasn't as much cheese as I wanted and the chicken didn't have a lot of meat. The fries were good, aside from one piece that was burnt.\n\nArrived at 7:45pm, out by 9:00pm. I'll probably come back to try out their breakfast, but in terms of expectations this place fell a little short for me."
3,I alway love their service and food.  We came with a large group and they service was on point and great.  Our order came our correct and the quality was great.
1,"I like ale house as a bar - cheap drinks and fun atmosphere. But their food is pretty lousy. It's all large portions w low prices. Maybe if you're drunk enough the food is decent, but on just a slight buzz, the food is pretty bad. The millers steak sandwich was THE WORST sandwich I've ever had in my life - steak marinated in a gross sweet sauce on greasy stale garlic bread w cold mashed potatoes on the side. Took a couple bites and tossed the rest.\n\nThey seem to do fried bar food pretty well, but its hard to screw that up. Stick to simple fried things and you'll probably be ok. My friend said their burgers also suck, but I will say that the nutty brother (nutter butter) dessert is ridiculously good."
3,"I had to go back. I kept hearing mixed reviews, and just had to taste the food for myself. Great selection of beers..and nice menu..everything is like $11-12, so bring some loot.  The thai pizza was off the charts, chicken a little dry, but the marinade was right on. I now have a place to go again on mill..haha.."
1,"The worst L&L in Vegas. The bathroom was so dirty I couldn't believe I was in a restaurant because my mechanic had a cleaner shop. If I wasn't late and starving I would have went somewhere else. The BBQ Chicken was no where near the best L&L I have had. Sad because a location like that should be a cash cow for the owners, I'm sure it was dead because of the cleanliness."
0,"Like most people I had heard from friends about how good the food at Rossario's was; so I had to try it. It was a Sunday, and one of the specials was \""Famous\"" sausage on some sort of pasta. I ordered a salad as a side, and we were brought bread to share. The salad was fine, the bread was fine, then our dinners arrived. I looked at my plate and I was started thinking, a steak may have been a better choice.\nI cut up the sausage and started chowing.  The sausage was a little hard on the outside, and pretty dry. The pasta and sauce were very bland, like the sausage. The friend I was with, had the same thing, and we came to the same conclusion. It was all very bland, no flavor what so ever.  \nI really couldn't understand how this place could be voted \""best of\"" anything. The service was friendly and prompt, price was reasonable, but the food just wasn't good. I might go back to have the big prime rib, but I'm apprehensive after the grey tastelessness that was my Sunday night dinner."
4,I love Panera bread! Every time I go the food is very fresh and delicious! I absolutely love the broccoli cheddar soup! I've tried all of their salads and they are so good! Love going here for healthy options and is very convenient in this shopping center!
0,"I don't understand why there is always a crowd. The whole wheat pizza crust was soggy and tasteless. The gluten free pizza, well, don't even bother to order it.   The only bright spot was my son's grilled chicken sandwich. We won't be going back any time soon."
0,"We came here for their timeshare presentation.  You will see their people on the strip asking you to come here in exchange for free shows and dinners.  The people on the street will tell you it takes two hours and then your on your way with your free gifts.  Let me be the one that saves you this huge waste of half a day while in Las Vegas.  You will be there longer than 2 hours, you will be treated like a nobody after you tell them no and have to wait another hour after to get your gifts.  The free dinner is one where you have to pick one of three items they offer.  One of the shows that was given was expired.  They will offer you 5 different prices for the timeshare which is far from the strip.  Please DONT waste your time here, rent the movie Boiler Room in your hotel room and you can say you experienced the Grandview Timeshare Presentation.  Look on line and see all the reviews and how many people want out of here....oh gotta go the shuttle back to the strip is here and this only took 4 hours because the computers were down, what a joke!  I have more respect for the folks playing instruments on the street asking for spare change, at least they work for their money and have more talent than these \""Salespeople\"" at this awful resort!!!!"
2,"Ate here in 2008 and based on that review would give them a 5-star.  Duck is out of  this world.\n\nMade a note to come back in 2009; which we did over labor day weekend.  I knew exactly what I wanted: DUCK.\nStopped in and was greeted with postings and cards at the host desk. Turns out that that week they had 3 menus on display: The std, the $7$7$7-$45 lounge menu and one week only \""Special\"" that was offered in many Vegas restaurants.  I asked if we can sit in the lounge and was walked over to some low profile couches and coffee tables. I said I wanted to sit in the lounge area that had normal tables; was told by the hostess that its called the Garden Lounge (ok, whatever) and the 777 menu is not offered there.  I told her I do not care, as I am here for dinner and asked if the $45 menu is available and she said YES.  We proceeded to sit down and wait 10 minutes for someone to walk up.  The LONE waitress was taking care of a large table and no one else was working there.  A guy in a suit came by and poured water. After another 5-7min and when the waitress went from the large table to a register to punch in orders,etc bypassing even a courtesy stop at our table: I went to the front to find out what the heck is going on.  The same guy started walking back with me; which at that point the waitress was at the table.  As I walked up, my wife said that they are not offering the $45 menu, as the \""weekly\"" special menu was in effect.  Now at this point, I am pissed since I could have had that answered when we first sat down.  We would have also sat in the main dining room if the $45 menu was suspended in the lounge . Front desk gave a wrong answer and the waitress was not attentive.  So I walked out!  Now again, if the duck was not available on the $45 menu; I would have ordered of the regular menu; but I want to receive prompt service and accurate info; which was not the case here!\nWill stop by again when we are back in Vegas, but will skip the whole lounge BS and just eat in the main restaurant.\nP.S.: Spoke to the Mgr, who turned out to be the young kid in the suit.  He shrugged his shoulders when I mentioned the issue.  There is no reason that he could not take our drink orders or answer any q's when the waitress was busy.  Shame that Japonais does such a poor job training and hiring staff :("
4,Excellent hem done quickly and beautifully!  Highly recommend
0,"I brought my 15 month old son in for his first haircut and I will not be going back. The woman who cut his hair was not the type of kid-friendly personality I would expect for someone working in that kind of place. She was very aggressive about trying to sell me hair products, even argumentative about other products and what is considered organic. And now that I look at his hair cut, it's uneven. I will just fix it myself instead of going back there.  They do have videos for the kids to watch, but overall it does look outdated into there.  I wish I had just gone to a regular place."
2,I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews and a personal recommendation.  We had beef and chicken entrees and both were overcooked.  The service was excellent and the staff were super friendly.
0,"This latest attempt to open a trendy restaurant near Scottsdale Road and Shea appears to be an early failure; so disappointing because we need more quality eateries around here.\nThe pork belly taco was way too dry and quite cold by the time it arrived. The carne asada taco was the best thing I ate here, but it was mediocre compared more authentic Mexican fare (e.g. Haba\u00f1eros). For non-authentic (gringo) tacos, the beef shoulder taco at Salty Sow is far superior.\nThe halibut ceviche was extremely bland, nearly awful, and at $12, a ripoff as well. There were only a very few pieces of inadequately marinated and under-seasoned halibut. I could taste the lime, but the dish lacked salt, cilantro and had virtually no chile flavor. I travel down the Baja coast regularly for work and I know what halibut ceviche can be, this place does not have it. The fish was borderline not-fresh (per my nose). The dish included an inordinate amount of vegetables, presumably to make up for the lack of halibut. The chef used (far too many) raw-ish kernels of yellow corn, which were extremely starchy (well out of season!) and made the whole dish very unpleasant to eat. I SO wanted to like the ceviche, but I simply could not finish it.\nThe best thing I tasted here were the home made corn tortillas that came with the tacos. I found them to be quite excellent.\nAll told, I spent $40 on dinner for one (including one draft beer which was not cold enough) and left hungry. This place just opened this week. Against my better judgement, I will give it one more try."
1,I used to love this place but have read on here that it is under new management. The are smaller and it does not taste anywhere how the rolls used to taste. They were so good but now they are horrible!  Service is great and only reason giving it two stars. Not going back!!
0,"michael kors store. march 11, 2011. putting you on blast for the worst treatment in a retail \""establishment \"" ever:\n\ni need to report the extremely rude and unprofessional treatment i received while vacationing and shopping at the shops at caesars palace--michael kors store. the evening of friday, march 11, 2011, circa 9pm, my husband and i were shopping for a new handbag for myself. we walked in the store, there was a big group of blond women talking and laughing. after some time, one of them, the only brunette in the group, plain-clothes dressed and the shortest one, whom we also noticed was barefoot--leans over and just casually says \""o, hello\"" (or some random type of greeting as if to imply, what are you doing here?\"") we said \""hello\"" though we didn't quite know what was going on. two street-clothes-dressed guys came out and walked out of the store from some door in the back by the shoes. my husband and i were standing by the shoes, shopping, when that same short, barefooted brunette girl comes dashing in front of me, and snatched a pair of shoes that were right in front of me--not saying a word--before i even had a chance to look at them!! she retreated back to her rowdy group of women she was standing with, shoes in hand. my husband and i then went over to the handbags. i picked one of them up to show him the zipper detail that i've recently observed in most handbags lately, when--all of a sudden--out of no where---that short, rude, barefooted brunette girl runs over and attempts to take the bag out of my hand--my husband observed that she was actually trying to do this--i must have been in shock from what was taking place--she says to me: \""$650.00$ honey\"". \""this is $650.00$\"".......\nhold the phones. excuse me?!? are you serious?? who did she think she was talking to?!? you do not talk to anyone that way, and especially a customer who has deliberately chosen to enter your store and shop your product and possibly purchase untold amounts of merchandise while they are taking time out from their las vegas vacation, when they could be doing an extreme amount of other things, and choosing to spend their money at any number of high-end merchandisers who are a dime a dozen in that vicinity. had she lost her ever-loving mind?!? this is absolutely unacceptable, and i expect something to be done about it."
3,"This is my type of place.  If you like sports, app food, and cold beer.  Welcome home.  They have two different types of dining areas.  One is a sports dungeon that doesnt see an ounce of sun, and the other is a lounge type relaxing couch zone.  TVs everywhere!!  \n\nAs far as hotel bars go, this location stands out.  It has a entrance/exit to the outside so its not like you have to go through the hotel or anything.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
0,"Dry, bland, overcooked, soggy with weird service. For the same price, just go eat dinner somewhere close by. P-Ho has a lot to offer: Cheeseburger in Paradise, PBR, Planet Dailies, Bugr to name a few."
0,"You can't sport the name Gordon Ramsay and serve us our entrees an hour after being seated..... Don't even bother speaking to the manager because all he'll do is tell you they can do better and invite  you to come back next time for a \""better experience\"" (no discount btw).....Seriously? There are plenty of great restaurants with better service in Vegas, why should I come back? Ridiculous! Don't waste your time here."
3,"This review is for the Dayclub.  Came on a Wednesday, so it was a chill day, but still lots of fun.  I was impressed with the bottle prices for during the week (about half the price of Encore Beach Club).  Had a cabana for  a $500 spend minimum.  Our waitress was great and the food and drinks amazing!!"
2,"Tried dinner there on a coupon. Overall a good experience, but not the caliber steakhouse the prices imply. Great martinis."
4,"I recently moved to Tempe and have been looking for a great nail place. I had my nails done at Ulta in Tempe Market Place, that was the worst decision ever, and have been suffering with the crap job I had. I was shopping at Trader Joes and was lucky enough to find this ADORABLE nail bar. It is decorated like a posh, Scottsdale nail bar, but with better pricing. They have a huge range of gel color (INCLUDING OPI). I picked a muted color, just to try them out, and the cost was average, $30 for a gel manicure. This will now be my spot. I can't wait to get a pedicure here!!!"
4,Amazing Pastrami Burger and Friendly service. I will eat here every time I travel to Las Vegas!
0,"In general, the quality of the work wasn't very good. Aesthetically, it is less than pleasing. One of the screaming problems they had technically was that they used a car jack (the upright kind) to jack up the air conditioner on my roof rather than professionally removing and replacing it. Then when we had problems with the air conditioner leaking (both water and air) because it wasn't set right the owner said it wasn't his problem. After he was unconscionably rude to me on the phone, he reluctantly agreed to fix the setting of the air conditioner. His fix was some rubber bits and a nail.\nThey also charged me $151.00 to comb out the fins on my air conditioner. Even though they never did that. I paid for that myself. \nThey also reused my old tiles that they had popped off my roof. The tiles that were broken when removed they replaced with some tiles that were taken from another job. \nThey left broken pipes in the roof and we had to tell them to replace them, because they weren't planning to. They were just going to leave them in and give us a check back for them when the job was done. \nThey backed into all of our awnings on one side of the house. They ruined a privet hedge that has been there since the 1940's. And they left garbage and nails everywhere. \nThe saga continues... At the beginning of this year, we found out (after paying two plumbing companies, replacing the toilet, cleaning up sewage, digging up the back yard) that Aladdin covered up the air flow pipe in our bathroom that caused us almost $1,000.00 in repairs, replacements and time. They fixed that and put in the pipe after a letter to the BBB and they said they would deduct all of those expenses from our final bill. They still have not. It has been months.\nIf you can believe this, the last invoice I received was an inaccurate and nasty \""You better take care of this or we will negatively effect your credit\"" invoice and they tacked on a late fee, just for good measure. Then, I get a ridiculous email from the head of accounting (the one with 20 years of experience who can't follow the terms of our contract) that says she is \""done playing games\"" with me. Had I known this was a game, I would have played along sooner. \n       The most horrible part of all of this, we went with them because they were local. We are very big on supporting local companies. They are an Arizona company and we really love to support our community. We checked them out on the BBB website and they had an A+ rating. And we also checked the ROC website and they had had no complaints so we felt confident hiring this business. We liked our sales men, yes, there were more than one. The work itself isn't impressive but I am over that. It is the treatment we have suffered from the owner and the head of the billing office since that is really shameful and I wouldn't wish this nightmare on anyone. Oh and by the way, we're still finding nails..."
1,We were visiting from Ohio and a friend wanted to meet here for lunch. The food is Gross! Awful house salad and cheap ginger dressing. Sushi was bland the hibachi rice was tasteless. Will not be back-2 stars for good company
4,"I've had many cupcakes before including Sprinkles & Crumbs Cupcakes in Beverly Hills, Yummy Cupcakes in Santa Monica & various others on a trip around L.A. where a friend & I decided to find the best cupcakes in the city for fun girls day out, most of them costing $5 or more each. \n\nIt's not until one year later living out here in Vegas now that I find Gigi's cupcakes that just blew all of those cupcake places out of the water!!!.  The best ever cupcakes. I've tried six already in three days with my roommate helping me.\n\nLemon Dream Supreme, Wedding Cake, Texas Milk Chocolate, Raspberries & Cream, & V - Day Special. The only one I don't recommend is the Hot Chocolate Mama, which took me by surprise because it is a chocolate cupcake flavored by hot peppers ( and It's hot!!! & Spicy) \n\nThe price is more than reasonable considering the quality & flavor, grocery stores charge more for way worse products & old frosting that taste stale. Better to choose quality over quantity any day!!!"
2,"They no longer cut your pizza for you.  Instead, they give yiu a \""pizza knife\"".  Trust me when I say it is barely better than a butter knife.  The server explained that the no longer cut their pizzas b/c it makes the crust go soggy quicker if it is cut.  I'm sorry, but that is just plain LAME!  I guess I will have to bring my own!"
0,"Hipsters, Hipsters, Hipsters everywhere and not a drop of decent coffee.\n\nThe coffee was mediocre at best. One of the worst iced carmel/vanilla lattes I've ever had. It was in a 16oz cup that costed more then a venti at Starbucks. Was this because of superior quality? Hardly. Hipsters can't make decent cup of joe. Its too mainstream for them. I was in the area, and remember seeing it, so I wanted to give it a try.\n\nThe atmoshpere was crowded and cluttered. Overall just messy. I feel like I walked into a sweat shop. OH did I mention hipsters? The pastries looked good. But i'd never purchese anything from greasy hipsters without it being FDA approved. And these bitches were making cupcakes in plain view.\n\nIf I ever were to come back, it would be to simply take pictures of all the patrons and post them at LATFH.com"
4,"normally, i love/hate going to the home depot. everytime i go, i get so many ideas of what i want to do to my home and yard, buy a bunch of stuff, then spend the next 8 weekends cursing wildly in the yard for starting yet another project. \n\nalso, going to home depot has always been stressful. i pretty much know how to do most anything, but i still need help finding the right pieces and parts (because i often overlook small details like measurements and sizes and thus wind up going back several times to get the right thing). it would be so much easier if a depot employee would just help me out a little. \n\nwell, this time i got lucky. gardening. not a strong suit but i'm tenacious and damnit, i will get it to grow one way or the other. still, this time, i didn't need help with my choices, but while loading a bag of sand into the truck, those darn paper bags...one of them burst. luckily Gabriel, one of the associates in the garden center must have overheard my F-bomb and came out with a shovel and broom. he first offered to go get me another bag, but it was my fault, so i would've felt guilty. when i declined, he helped me refill the bag almost down to the very last grain, duct taped the hell out of it, and all of it with a smile. \n\ni'll have to change my regular depot to this one if that's the kind of service they offer!"
4,"A charcoal grilled burger and a pitcher of beer? Yes, please. The buns are just supermarket buns and the fries and onion rings are previously frozen, but I like this place a lot for lunch."
4,"Whenever I'm in town for work, I make a point to eat here. The coffee is always hot and fresh, the meats and cheese they use for their salads and sandwiches is so delicious and the bakery items are no joke! I haven't had their breakfast yet, but I hope to someday! The wifi is good, so you can get work done over your meal if you need to. It can get pretty busy during lunch, so be courteous and don't take a large table I you're a party of one! And get a cinnamon roll. They are divine and as big as my hand!"
3,"To be honest, I am a graduate of the Boiling Crab and amongst all the oc crawfish places, BC still reigns supreme!  But there is something to be said of the lemon pepper sauce here. Since this is my only las vegas experience I'm giving it a 4. With BC being a 5!  Come before 6 to avoid the lines!"
4,"From the owner to the bar-backs, everyone here is inviting and makes you feel welcome.  I met the owner on my very first visit.  He remembered my name on every visit after.  The drink prices are phenomenal especially at 2-4-1 happy hour.  And they aren't afraid to make a good stiff drink!  The drag shows are always entertaining and the karaoke DJ always takes care of us.  And don't forget about the monthly alternatives they offer , like Bearacuda!  If you are looking for a club, go somewhere else.  But if you are looking for a great time, hit this place up!  I'd give it ten stars if I could!"
3,Ive been here a few times to grab a quick bite and a few beers. Never disappointed! cant say ive had there pizza so ill review that at another time. love the chicken club! service is always good.  Saw a couple gentlemen next to me get wings and they looked delicious! Try the chilli cheese dip its good (the chips are thick not the cheap greasy thin crap)
0,"I decided to make an appointment here after seeing the Yelp $25 off special for 1st time customers.  Big mistake.  I had full highlights done by Lauren and although we reviewed ahead of time what I liked and was looking for, I ended up with the opposite.  I don't like chunky highlights and I like my hair blended naturally, but I ended up with chunky highlights.  The worst part however, was that she didn't get the bleach closer to my scalp so I had root problems from the second I left.  Not like the quarter inch of roots that usually is there when you highlight but a huge line which had people commenting to me the next day I should go get my money back .\n\nOn top of that, the atmosphere was far from relaxing.  As I was being shampooed my girl and the other hairstylists' in the area were arranging their transportation for the next day at work.  \""Can you give me a ride? can you pick me up? what time?\""  I understand that this may need to be done at some point but it came across as totally trashy to be discussing that in front of clients.  Why don't you just guilt me into giving you a bigger tip so maybe one day you can get a car?\n\nIn summary, for what the services provided are, which I would equate to some bargain brand haircutting shops, I think this place is ridiculously expensive."
4,Went on a date with hubby and really loved this place.  The Chive flags really got us ;)\n\nExcellent service from arrival to departure.  I had a Jack & diet coke and a huge mason jar of Angry Orchard and it was enough for me. 3 will have you done!  Food was great- we ordered mini sliders and fried pickles.\n\nWe will return for sure!
1,"Not a bad place. Probably one of your better bets if you're meeting someone for lunch(it's down Phoenix after all!) The atmosphere is lively enough with every sporting event showing on the multiple tvs. Service was good, and fast and efficient for the lunch crowd.\n\nThe menu consists of the usual burgers and sandwiches. My chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired. The one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing. If anything I could maybe find myself back here for a couple off beers and some of that bleu cheese with a side of wings.\n\nProbably fun pre or post game. Otherwise, don't see myself coming back."
1,"I went to this place expecting so much more, based on other reviews.  There was three employees working and one person in front of me in line.  We stood there for ten minutes before the lady told us she would be \""right there\"", as they scurried around doing God knows what.  When she returned there were at least six people in line and from a customer service stand point, she seemed to care less. Prices are not bad and coffee was average."
3,I typically prefer going here for breakfast because it's sooooo freakin good! Lunch of dinner is good but I need to be in the mood. I recommend the cajun burger if you do though. 4 stars for slow service the past three times I've gone.\n\nDid I mention they play really good music? That's key for me. If they played some bumpkin country music it wouldn't be as cool ya know what I mean?
0,Horrible place to bring your kids. They go thru teachers like it's no ones business. The staff they had over a year ago was amazing. Now they are rude and could careless about what's going in. Ms Keisha is wonderful however the other director is rude and cares about herself. She doesn't talk to the kids or play with them. A year ago I'd say this place was feast. Now I'd say go anywhere else but there. I pulled my kids out of there and I now have stability for my kids vs random people in and out.
3,"Please note that this review is by a person that is not a big cupcake fan.  I am,  however, a occasional sweet freak, so this qualifies me well for this spot.  Fumanchu cupcakes is a cupcake haven filled with the most eclectic array of cupcakes your taste buds could imagine.  The French Toast and sausage combo I tried was superb.  Looking at the cupcakes with alcohol definitely has my interest, but decided against it for that early morning business meeting these were purchased for.  As a ardent blueberry fan, I  will have to return to try this also.  All in all, a great little spot."
1,Meh. I've experienced better. Honestly this place is overpriced. At 18 dollars a person I felt I had been ripped off! Seriously took less than 30 minutes to walk the whole thing!  I d rather walk the aquarium aisle at Walmart then come to this place again.
3,"I've frequented Modern Steak a few times and honestly each experience has been different. I first went here with another couple for restaurant week and the service was rather snooty. We felt rushed and skipped over- that sticks out over the food I ate there that night. \n\nThe other and most recent excursion to Modern Steak was for happy hour. We ate in the bar area, which is just as lovely as the main dinning area, and the menu was very good! Only problem was trying to figure out what to order first. Fries were yummy and the sliders were very good- believe I got two orders of the sliders."
1,"I like this store, I think I enjoy it mostly because it's also attached to a Toys R Us which we tend to use more these days.  The store is clean but the customer service is simply not there.  And in reality you'll find almost anything in the store at a lower price somewhere else."
1,"My first experience was when the restaurant first opened.  My boyfriend and I walked in and saw that there was not table service and the place was difficult to walk around in so we walked out and went somewhere else that night.  \nThe second experience was a take out order.  I walked in and was told that I could not place an order at the front and was told to walk around the restaurant to the other entrance and place an order there.  I wish I had been walked to that area, via the inside of the restaurant, and just been told that there was a separate entrance for take out orders so that I did not have to wait at the main entrance.  I ordered my meal and Rhonda was at the cashier station.  When I mentioned that I was from Tucson, AZ, she was even more welcoming and shared the history that she and Joe have with Tucson.  We exchanged business cards and they were both great and friendly.  The meal I took home was alright, nothing special but I thought I would try coming in and sitting down next time because the service format had changed and there was now table service.  Good idea.\nThe third experience was when my boyfriend and I walked in and we were first seated at a table in the middle of the room.  No thank you, we asked for a more private booth and were seated in a more comfortable area.  We noticed that every table that came in the restaurant was offered the same \""middle of the room table\"" that we were offered and they all turned it down as well.  Our server was a young woman who was    friendly and welcoming,  I ordered the Jasmine tea after asking her she would recommend it or not, she said, \""I don't drink it so I don't know\"".  I ordered it anyways and it was good.  She came back with our drinks and then took our order.  For an appetizer we ordered the Feta Cheese and Olive dish.  The chunks of cheese were too large and numerous, the olives were on the plate where the juices ran all over.  They should have been in a small bowl and then put on the plate.  The olives were pitted too and that is a sign of an inferior taste, and the flavor was strong but inferior.  They tasted like cheap olives.  I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes and rice.  When the dish came I was so surprised that I was served the Back Bone Cut of the Chicken.  Never in my life have I ever served or been served the Back Bone of a chicken.  There are many very small bones that come off of the vertebra and the meat is tender but the pieces are difficult to get to with a knife and fork.  That is a piece saved for the stock pot.   I sent it back and was given a huge breast which was dry and over seasoned.  The meal was so bad that I ate three bites and we paid the bill and left.  I realize that this is not fast food and it is not a 4 star establishment but the food was not good and the servers are not well trained.  Our server filled our glasses every time we took a sip and checked up on us every 2 minutes, the knives were sent back because they were dirty, the food was terribly prepared, served and when we gave feedback we were looked at like we had two heads.  On top of it, when Joe came to the table to apologize, I reminded him of our previous meeting and he must not have heard one word that I said because he just stared at me and then went on about the food.  I owned 4 restaurants for many years and I know what good service is, this was poor service and poor food.  When the owner meets a customer, it is important to remember them because even when the food  is off for the night, the customer will give you another try.  For me, three strikes and you are out and I have a story that I will share with friends now."
0,"I've been to this nail salon for a while now but some lady by the name of Jackie did my nails and i had a horrible experience so never again! She was so rough with my hands and every time she was done looking at one hand she would throw it instead of gently going to my next hand. Another thing about this nail salon is that they always change their prices and I've been going here for maybe 6 months now. I get the same thing all the time and they always change the prices up on me and one time i confronted them about it they were just stuttering and hesitating and making up lame excuses. Another thing that bothered me was that Jackie was so rough with my hands she had cut my finger and i was bleeding. I don't know about you but there should be no reason why there would be a cut not anywhere near your nail, it was on my knuckle. Another thing was that i asked if she could just draw a cross which is 2 lines and she couldn't even do that so i got charged more for a damn 3d cross that i did not want. I will never be going here ever again and i was a loyal customer who always tipped $10 no matter what but no thanks I'm good!"
0,Is there any need to charge \u00a34.50 for a pint of Guinness? I'm also used to getting my main course at dinner served hot rather than tepid.\n\n\n No complaints about the courteous staff though.
4,I desperately needed to get my nails done! I walked in and only had to wait 10 mins. Cholisa (I think that's her name) did a fantastic job. A shellac manicure and a toe color change for $40.  What an affordable price and she did an amazing job. She wasn't in a hurry and actually had a great conversation with me. All the technicians are very kind and will basically do any nail design that you could think of! I will definitely be coming back!
1,"This used to be my go to AYCE but it's been about 3 months since coming here and I now find myself highly disappointed and dissatisfied. As always the service is good. They are punctual and gear to take orders, refill drinks, and clear plates. But it's not the service that I'm disappointed with, it's the quality of the food. Much of the fish served here is precut and unfortunately I was getting slices that ranged from fresh looking and tasting, to old and tasteless. The amount of rice they give with the nigiri is crazy. The rice had a slight mush to it with little flavor. The worst had to be the masago (smelt roe) and the scallop. The Masago was mushy and didn't have any texture you would expect from fresh fish roe. The scallop was clearly premade hours before and left to sit. It's up in the air whether I am returning or not."
1,"Second visit occurred 5-7-2014. Dined for two with reservations which made wait time excellent as well as food delivery time. I enjoyed beet salad,which was best experience. Pretzels were old tasting and dry. Beef sliders dry and over cooked. Deviled egg filling was very dry and not creamy in consistency; however the vinegar on egg white shells were good. We asked waitress if Mr. Ramsay was involved in restaurant operations and we were advised he most certainly is; however, it would be beneath him to consider \""amateur\"" reviews on Yelp. Waitress indicated the people who work at restaurant are best equipped to know what's good versus customers. \n\nFirst visit occurred on 5-4-2014 with group of six. Service took 2 hours but food seemed better, lamb burger was reported by my table as delicious. I didn't order food but reserved my opportunity 3 days afterward.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars since the waitress' comments suggest there is no place in their business for customer feedback since owner is celebrity chef and has \""better things to do with his time than to look at Yelp or hear from amateur food critics.\""\n\nPlace is not worth the expense."
2,"Yes, the prices on some items are great!  The carts are huge!  And, the day I went it was packed to the rafters with customers!  Upon entering the store there was a child screaming who continued to scream for at least 40 minutes. I was wandering back and forth throughout the store trying to locate items on my list.  This is not an easy thing to accomplish in a store this size, and did I mention I have had both hips replaced with the second one done in December?  I use a cane to help walk and have a knee that also needs to be replaced. So here I am being bumped into, walking from one end of the store to the other, and then I reach the checkout. I had no idea you needed to bag your own groceries!  I wanted to die!  I asked the checker if there wasn't some help available.  No help!  By the time I got home I could barely walk and was exhausted. Will I go back?  Not likely."
2,There was poor selection of foods.\nThe quality of foods was just low.\nIt is not worth to pay $30.00 plus at all.
0,"Overall: swanky buffet but it's not as tasty as it looks\n\nPros\n-all kinds of food\n- gelato is super tasty\n- mushroom truffle soup\n-charcuterie station\n-crepe station\n\nCons\n- the seafood was rather sad/ bad\n- no crab legs\n- lines for anything like prime rib or tacos take forever \n\n\nSidenote: \n-come if you have no plans, lines are so long it's hard to say when you'd get out of here\n- quality is lacking, especially when you are paying this much for a buffet"
0,"We were very excited about the opening of this restaurant. Unfortunately, we thought the food and service was worth only one star.  \n\nThe restaurant was not super busy but steady when we arrived. The hostess was nice and immediately walked us to our table.\n\nThe staff was rude and very short. Our server never checked on us to see if we needed anything. If we were lucky enough to be able to flag someone down to ask for refills; we never saw them again. We watched several people at different tables get up and leave because the service was so bad. These folks just threw cash on table for there drinks and left. \n\nAs for the food, it was cold and did not look appetizing. For the same money, we would rather go to Houston's...you always get great food and service. \n\nWe do not understand how this place received the amazing reviews."
1,"I really admire what these guys are doing especially in the high desert of Las Vegas.  It is another facet that adds to the the sin cities list as not only a gamblers paradise but a food mecca as well with omg some developing culture.  Well at least a little, we probably need a few more generations and some starving artists needs to be the next Picasso.\n\nTrying to find these guys was fine.  Standing in line was not a problem I've waited longer on hold with banks and airlines.  We had the barbie, pep, pulled pork and captain's burgers / sliders.  Sounds like a lot but you gotta try everything if your going to wait in a line.  The smell, taste and style was almost reminiscent of the food that you see at carnivals or town fairs.  \n\nI love the burgers cooked on the outdoor grill at the farmer's market in SF.  The Slider Truck cooked everything decently and the flavors worked well.  Jut not overly impressed with the food.  Simple, done right but nothing innovative.  Didn't care for the pork which normally I love pig over beef.  \n\nA little tired of bbq sauce on burgers, there are a billions different styles and recipes, but at the end of the day they all have the same flavor elements which would taste good on anything chicken, steak, fries etc.  Doesn't make it great."
4,"The place is so crowded with people lined up. The burger was amazing, came with regular size but it just simply melting in your mouth. Even though the place was super busy, the staff still motivated, and offer a friendly service. This is the best burger in AZ, as we tried all other fast food outlet. Tried the hotdog as well, but the burger much better. This is a must stop when you are at AZ ."
4,"I've needed either glasses or contacts since the mid 80s. Of all the offices I've been to, this is my absolute favorite. The office is convenient, clean and spacious. The staff is friendly and recognizes me when I walk in. I'm very happy with Dr. Eskew and like her very much. (I haven't seen Dr. Cooley.)  I can't think of a reason to not like this office. There are lots of other dr's offices that could take some tips from Val Vista Vision."
4,"I loved my food at Spago. I loved my boyfriend's food at Spago. I loved Spago. :) It made for a really great food memory. Pricey, but worth it."
4,I've never had a bagel so good in my life.  Seriously! I can't tell you what it is but these guys have unlocked the secret to the perfect bagel.  They're heavenly when they're still hot and served as a sandwich.  Prices are excellent and so this place is busy but definitely a top spot for the bagel lovers.  The best bagel in Charlotte.
0,"I dined in with my gf on a whim at around 8pm on a Monday night and most certainly regret it. We we definitely not dressed in the typical business casual/business professional attire like the rest of the customers were. I was in jeans, t-shirt, and baseball hat. My girlfriend was in a hoodie and jeans. And let me tell you, our waitress definitely treated us as if we didnt belong there. She glazed through the menu and the specials for us and asked us for our drink orders. We ordered some martinis off their featured list. 10 min later our drinks arrived and she arrived to take our orders.\n\nWe decided to do the tasting menu they had available so we could try a couple different things. The Caprese salad came out relatively quick. We both really enjoyed it. It was flavorful and plentiful. Now came the really annoying part. We sat at our table for over 25 min before our entrees came out. The entire time without even a check back from our waitress to see how we were doing. We could see the server station from our table and watched her just sit there talking with other servers and cooks. I got the penne with broccoli and she got the Ziti. My pasta was horrible, no flavor at all. If I wanted pasta with light butter I would have made it at home and saved the $17. The Ziti was much better than my pasta, it had good flavor but was way over portioned with the peppers. I will re-state that even up to this point we still had not seen our server again. There was another waiter (not a waiters assistant) that had to stop and get us refills and check if we were ok. It wasnt until 15min after we had finished with our entrees that she finally came back over and asked us which dessert we wanted to get. \n\nWe ordered the canoli. They were decent but you could tell they were not fresh and the outer part was way too hard and slightly stale. \n\nOverall the service was definitely the part that completely ruined my experience at that place. Just because I wasnt dressed in my business attire, does not mean we should have been treated any different than those who were. I will never go back and definitely never recommend this place to anyone."
4,This is a FABULOUS place for traditional Chinese desserts--very fresh and the service is excellent!
4,"I've been enjoying sushi since 1980 and Narita is my regular Sushi Bar here in Las Vegas.  In a nutshell at Narita I get artfully and deliciously prepared sushi made with fresh, top quality fish, large portions at the lowest \u00e1 la carte price in town. One of the best kept secrets in town if you're a sushi lover!"
0,"Usually I hate that you have to rate a place AT LEAST one star b/c really some places should be negative if you ask me. However, this time I don't mind. The decor itself, very nice (hence the one star).  Me and my girls got lucky and got approached by two girls asking to join their group so it worked out for us not paying the cover or having to wait in line. But once inside there was literally nowhere to go!!! We finally found the little room towards the back   and were able to have some space to dance. \n\nThe whole time I was thinking to myself \""OK this place is about 2-3 stars\"" UNTIL i saw some chick throw her LIT CIGARETTE onto the CARPET. I'm usually not one to play fire marshall but the crowdedness of the place totally got to me. SO i told some waiter guy that the girl through her LIT CIGARETTE onto the carpet and he didn't care. In which i replied \""SOOOO THIS PLACE ISN'T GOING to catch on fire.\""  In which he stepped on the lit cigarette for me.  (k scene -1 star)\n\nWalking back to my group some other guy smoking totally almost burned my arm off while he was swinging around his cigarette he was smoking. I don't mind smokers or the occasional one cigarette while drunk but the people here are just ridiculous about it.  If you've read this whole review... wow.. thanks for reading my ramble.. which i guess tends to happen when the boss is out of the office and you can't help but yelp instead of work..."
0,"I've noticed that the majority of bad reviews on this \""4.5 star\"" restaurant are from Californians. There's a really good reason for that. Apparently I should've read the reviews more carefully before I went to this terrible restaurant.\n\nComing from Los Angeles and having stellar sushi (no, not rolls, sushi), I should've judged the book by its cover. Driving up to this location, I could already see that it was a 'roll' place.\n\nLive Uni for 22 bucks? No thanks. I can get the same thing in Los Angeles for 7 dollar a piece.\n\nI don't want to be racist, but this is a Korean owned joint. My family simply ordered the combo meals. I myself had a beef teriyaki plate. Why would I get that at a sushi place? I'm not quite sure. But I guess being on vacation threw me off.\n\nAnyways, the food was cold when it came out to me. It was disgusting. The beef was cold, the tempura was cold, and altogether this joint just doesn't deserve the 4.5 stars it has. I feel so bad for those people who think this place is the best sushi joint ever. I think it just says that Vegas lacks a proper sushi restaurant. When you're in Los Angeles, go to Little Tokyo. Any of those restaurants with good OR bad reviews will top this place.\n\nAvoid this place. Expensive, disgusting."
3,"Finally got to eat at Jim N Nicks and yum. If you aren't a fan of chains you should know that each location can source their ingredients as they see fit, that's pretty unique. I had brisket, butter tender. At the table we had fries, onion rings, beans, slaw and fried green tomatoes. All fresh and delicious, particularly loved the beans. This is crazy but the cheese biscuits - one was plenty for me - they are super sweet. Good stuff, looking forward to going back."
1,"Based on the service the other day, this location is down to 2 stars from 5. For whatever reason, ALL their chocolate ice creams were too soft to be served. And since I came here specifically for the chocolate therapy, this was a huge disappointment. I sadly ordered a regular sized  non-chocolate flavor and the woman working scooped it into a child sized cup. While I think I still got the correct amount of ice cream for a regular, it was overflowing in the small kiddie cup making it a little difficult/messy to eat. I think I'll just stick to buying my Ben and Jerry's pints from the grocery store."
1,My brother took the whole family to eat here n all I could say I've tasted better food. The food was alright nothing to be amazed about I rather eat my step-dads food which he cooks some good Cuban food. Wouldn't bother coming here again.
0,Food poisoning alert!  My husband and I both had It.  We called to let them know and they expected me to go to the ER and have a doctor's note! They wouldn't even refund our bill and after our gift card it was only $22. I guess it was worth it to them. They said they'd call me back for some unknown reason and never did.
3,"Sometimes you tire of various types of food and sometimes nothing but a hot dog will do.  I live in the S.F. Bay Area, was visiting in Tempe and had one of those afternoons when I wanted nothing but a hot dog.\nI got the foot long and it tasted good, but next time I'll try the all-beef which my wife had.  The kitchen is well-maintained and the self-service is efficient, even with a line 20 deep.  The grill uses charcoal.  Although I didn't order any fries or onion rings, they looked good and Ted's also touts real ice cream milkshakes.\nThe only minor downgrade I have is that the location is in a strip mall and it just lacks a traditional hot dog stand feel to it.  It's clean, but maybe just a little too clean.  Otherwise, very good..."
1,"Was headed out of town for the weekend and thanks for a flight delay I had some time to kill and thought it would be cool to check out what Terminal 4 has to offer now so I checked things and out and made my way on over to Barrio Caf\u00e9. \n\nOk one of the things I like about Phoenix Sky Harbor, they are supporting locally owned restaurants and bringing them into the terminals for others to enjoy, I think it's a great thing. https://skyharbor.com/pdf/Terminal_4_L3_Current.pdf\nI like the look of Barrio Caf\u00e9, the art work is cool. \n\nI think there is a lot of improvement to be made with the hostess and there crew, when I 1st got there I told the host I was a party of one, she gave some other person a menu and told them to sit me at the bar table area facing the people walking to their gates,  walked me to the spot, put menu down and walked away, not once did they check to see if this chair belonged to someone else, maybe the drink should tipped them off, told the person whose seat I just stole I was sorry, walked back up to the podium and gave them back my menu, then they put me at a table for 4 with 3 other guest who didn't even know each other, and this was a bench seat, so I had to ask the man if he would mind moving the bench so I could sit down.  This was not cool, I was so very close to saying screw this shit I'm out. Since I was at table with a bunch of strangers I didn't know and room was limited my idea of reading my book while eating a meal was no longer available.  Barely had room for my purse on the seat because everyone but me had a carry-on bag. Also at the table next to me a man was sat there, and he waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came to him so he walked up the bar to order his own beer, but when he left his table the host put 2 people at it, he came back and saw no room for him anymore. \n\nOur server was Victor, he was a friendly guy just very over worked, I even heard him tell the host not to place anymore people in his area until he can clear some tables.  Again this is something I shouldn't be hearing.\n\nOk so I had some time to check out Barrio Cafes web site while waiting and learned 2 things, supposedly this is truly excellent, very authentic Mexican food and BC notes on its website that its food is not deliberately chile-hot, wants the flavor of the seasoniongs & spices to revel themselves.  So don't expect heat, no chips no salsa either.\n\nAfter looking the menu over I went with the burrito pollo pablano , it had grilled chicken breast with roasted poblano peppers, caramelized onions & garlic with goat cheese and a cream reduction and had the choice of salad or spicy French fires (because spicy French fries are way more authentic than beans or rice?) I picked the side salad, it was salad greens with diced tomato and goat cheese on top of it with a balsamic dressing, it was good, enjoyed the flavors.  The burrito though, I had high hopes, the chicken looked like the stuff you can get at the store, the deli fresh grilled chicken breast, it was perfectly sliced with grill marks, had no flavor at all, the peppers, onions and garlic was bland, no flavor, the goat cheese didn't have that bite it normally has, the cream reduction was like a thin alfredo sauce but bland. This entire burrito lacked flavor & spice and not the heat type of spice.\n\nI wasn't impressed with Barrio Caf\u00e9 , even if it was the airport addition and not sure if I would wonder on over the downtown Phoenix location .  And I really wanted to like it, So thrilled that Sky Harbor is putting in locally owned places, just think they missed when they added this one, but good news is Los Taquitos is almost done being built."
2,"Ate lunch there today, and was pretty happy with the food and service.  Pleasant atmosphere, and because of the large windows,  it felt open and airy.  The pies are yummy and fresh."
0,The owners changed. This new owner cut the 'half' sandwich size to half the original size. The broccoli and cheddar soup is now so watery not as chunky as before.  They no longer serve coffee either. I wish Jane and her team still ran the place. The new owners are obviously trimming costs everywhere. Well they have lost my business and I will never go to them for my company catering either. A major rip off!
0,"Stopped in with my boyfriend on Sunday night to grab a bite to eat on our way back to our room. By that time the restaurant was closed so we could only get pizza by the slice. They had pepperoni or cheese so we grabbed a slice of each. The pizza was very greasy. Unfortunately, we have both been sick with food poisoning ever since. Needless to say, we won't be returning."
4,"BOOOOMM you'r e back in the 1920's, your in Chicago, any minute now the police will pile in and arrest you for drinking during the time of prohibition!!\n\nThis for me is the coolest bar in Stockbridge hands down! Its cool and smarty without trying, its has that dark im not in a swank place feel but still somehow makes you feel like you are.\n\nIm not sure what they are doing but I like it...! And they give you popcorn/pretzels for a wee nibble!\n\nGreat whisky shelf, awesome tequila(its distilled in Scotland), and cool cocktails!!\n\nAwesome place!"
1,"We stopped by Sunday evening 11/14 for our favorite zucchini sticks and wings. We got 2 orders of zucchini sticks which were over fryed and several had burnt ends. They were pretty crunchy and based on the countless times we have had zucchini here at Timbers this was the worst. The 3 guys shared 2 orders of 12 wings and fries.  Again, looks like the cook forgot the fries in the fryer because they were well done and crisp also.  Wings were just ok.  They were pretty small  as they have been on several occasions the last few times we have had them here.  I think they need to find a new supplier because a $1 each they are small.  But, they were still good.  I tried the chili.\nWe have been coming here for several years and I had never had the chili.  It was ok, but not my kind of chili.  Lots of beans including the white ones which I am not fond of in chili.(prefer all Red Kidney).  There were nice chunks of meat and tomato but it had no flavor.  It was really kind of boring.  No heat, no spice, no nothing. The chef should taste the food.  It had some melted cheese on top but that did not help the flavor.  So, I will not have this again.  Our Server Jennifer was great.  We have had her several times and she is very attentive with the drinks and keeping the table clean.  I posted 3 pics of what we had to eat. We will continue to come here for a bite but lately the food has not been as good as in the past."
1,"Another Meeeeeh option in The Venetian food court. They have pizza and pizza related items as well as breakfast.\n\nThe breakfast was not good (eggs, sausage, potatoes). I still have no clue how one can mess breakfast up.\n\nPizza was whatever, not worth they money they charge. \n\nThis place is one of the only late night food options in the hotel, so many people like me don't have a choice when trying to grab a bite at 4am after a night out."
1,"I am not a biker. I'm a wife and mom who wanted to get our bikes ready for the spring and summer. This place is close to home and is fairly priced. I was appalled at how I was treated. I stood in the store for 30 minutes, by the register, just waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  The store employee was talking to a \""real\"" biker and could see me but never even offered a hello or we'll be with as soon as we can. I'm not an irrational person, I understand waiting for help, but to ignore me entirely is just poor customer service. \n\nWhen I was finally given service they treated me like I was in the way and bothering them with my simple tube replacement on three bikes. I was told I would get a call when they were ready, I had to call them. When I went to pick up my bikes I stood around for another 30 minutes while the TWO store employees took care of all the bikers around me. Again, not even so much as a hello until they were ready to help me. \n\nNow, the pricing is fair and they work quickly, however the impression I got was they only want to work with the pro bikers and tourists. The mom coming in with family bikes only takes time away from more important business. I will not take my bikes to this store again. I'll pay a few extra dollars for kindness and acknowledgement....somewhere else!"
3,"I like it - a lot!!  But..... Short one star because you'd better plan on waiting (a long time) on the weekends - this place always has a line. That's usually a good sign and it is true here since the food is really tasty. However, the coffee quality suffered and the service was a bit spotty the last time we went. Back to the food - omelettes are tasty and french toast for kids is a hit. Love the character of the various types of staff here (tattoos, piercings, etc.) just means they're a good eclectic bunch - they're busting their tails in and out of the kitchen and they definitely work hard for their pay!!"
1,"I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!"
3,This a solid place to grab lunch or a bite at all hours. Two sizes of sandwiches and getting the large one to split makes it a good deal and the quality is there. The sausage sub and the cold Italian sub are both winners and they do a good job of getting you through the line filling your order. Been many times and every time it has hit the spot.
1,"I come to Vegas at least 3 times a year and always at least get a blow-out, if not a cut when I arrive in hopes of not having to deal much with  my hair for the few days I am here.  Well, that certainly did not happen this time.  I had had my hair cut one time before by Brandon, and was not too impressed in that my hair felt dirty and didn't last very well.  But, Brandon was such a sweetheart that when I arrived this last time I decided to give him another try for a blow-out.  Bad decision.  The style was so contrived, with pieces being sprayed into place, that I didn't have a good feeling when I left.  Upon seeing me, my boyfriend actually laughed..thus reinforcing my opinion of the finished product.  It only got worse, my hair was staticky, dull, and felt dirty and like straw.  My appointment was late afternoon, and by the next morning I was in a ponytail.  I wanted to cry.  I honestly don't know if it is the products or the technique, or a combination of both, but I can honestly say this was the worst I have ever had in my years of coming to Vegas.  I am mad that I paid the $85 I did...and even tipped(based on his personality) all for nothing.  I could have done better myself.  I definitely will not be back.  We all know how important hair is to a woman.  Needless to say, this really put a damper on my mood for the remainder of our Vegas stay.  :-("
0,"Bought the groupon for exam, X-rays, and 3 adjustments.  Mind you, until now i was completely uneducated on chiropractors and assumed i was buying 3 actual adjustments... you know, where you can hear and feel the difference.  Setting the appointment was quick, easy and friendly. \nAt the first appointment the office staff and doctor seemed a little 'too friendly'.  We (my spouse, daughter and I) waited for a while then were all escorted to a room to watch a video.  The video was of testimonials saying how awesome this new NUCCA chiropractic treatment was.  \nAfter more waiting the doc came in, told my spouse (who I bought the groupon for) to get on this scale that weighs each side of your body.  Wow, he was 20 pounds heavier on his right side.  Then the doc took X-rays and told us to set another appointment for the adjustment, which would give them time to evaluate the X-rays.  \nSo we set an appt for the next morning.  After some more waiting we were escorted to the room to watch another video of all the NUCCA believers testimonials.  While we were waiting in there both my daughter and I stepped on the scale.. Hey you guessed it.. We were both 20 pounds heavier on our right sides.. Not to mention my daughter is only 6 years old lol.\nSo doc comes in \""I have good news and bad news.. The bad news is that your spine is pretty messed up.. Good news is I think our treatments will help you!\"" \nThen he presents us a paper with the pricing on the 8 weeks of treatment he recommended to 'get better' $2100.. \""But if you pay up front it's only $1700.\"" \nBy then we already knew we wasted the $45 on the groupon.  So finally time for the \""adjustment\"".  The doc literally rubbed my spouses neck with pressure lighter then my 6 year old would apply for about 25 seconds.\nNow to not continue to bore you with a pretty lame experience, it seems all they want is your money.  The adjustment did absolutely nothing to my spouse.  We no call no showed the last 2 appts and feel good about it.. Lol.  \nHopefully this review saves some others from wasting their time and money on something that is truly \""all in your mind\"".\nOn a good note for the company, while we waited and waited those 2 days, there were a lot of patients signing in to get their \""adjustments\"".   So for some, the mind funk obviously works. . . But if you want to feel a difference I say make sure you're going to a real back cracking body rubbing fair priced chiropractor.\nThanks for reading ;)"
3,"The line here SUCKS. Big hairy (insert vulgar line here). \n\nBut apart from the 2 hour wait on Black Friday, the food here is great.\n\nNot gonna lie, the service wasn't top notch like the first time I had been here. The waiter forgot that I ordered water and when I asked him again, he was like \""Oh sure, of course!\"" and both my dad and I were just befuddled at how no lightbulb went off in his head that we had already ordered that. And he was lucky that night, my parents and I didn't go crazy so he didn't have that many plates to clear.\n\nThe pumpkin and mushroom ravioli was DIVINE. I kept going back for more. The sweetness of the pumpkin was so refreshing in the ravioli, compared to all your typical meat sauce and cheese raviolis. The beet salad was also a great palate cleanser, I love beets! Ooh, and don't forget the prime rib! It was super tender and my favorite part was actually the more well done outer bits of the slice. And for the first time, I dipped the meat into the sauce that's supposed to go with prime rib...like heaven. In ma mouth. \n\nLet's see...what else, I don't know, they have all your typical buffet stuff, soup, salad, sushi, seafood, meat, classics, asian, etc. \n\nI looove their dessert line though. The banana crepes are soo delish and all the desserts are so cute. Little tarts, cookies, cakes and creams. And they even have a gelato scooper at the end. I tried as much as I could to my sweet heart's desire.\n\nThis was also a special occasion for me because I paid for our meal with my 1st paycheck ever :D I think because it was dinner and thanksgiving weekend, the buffet was about $37 or something per person. The grand total turned out to be about $111 or somewhere around there. \n\nIt's really sad that M is so far off the strip. It's a really nice and classy hotel in my opinion. And I think the buffet is really reasonable and worth it compared to some of the bigger hotels right on the strip. \n\nI'll definitely come back next time during the cheaper lunch on non-holiday weekends!\n\nP.S. It really irks me how buffet lines don't just give you a buzzer to tell you when it's your party's turn next...doesn't it make sense not to make people stand in your line for 2 hours that they could be spending depositing their life savings into your slot machines and crap tables?! If you let us wander while we wait for our spot in the buffet, we would definitely end up playing. Come on, it's vegas!"
0,"This is for breakfast only. The lunch looks good. \nI got a Denver omlet. A little pricey at almost $12 for the omlet, biscut and McDonald's type deep fried hash browns. So salty I could only eat a little and leave. \nWon't eat here again for breakfast. Maybe lunch is better."
0,"Have been here a few times and all three (3) visits were a let-down. The food is marginal as I have found much better Thai food in other locations in town. Marnee Thai was better back in the day, and the Thai Noodle House and Archie's are much better. Additionally, the service here has lacked a great deal upon every visit. \""Busy\"" does not necessarily translate into \""quality\"". Would never return."
2,"The shop itself is adorbs.  Located in the Baxter Town Center just off of I77, it was easy to find right next to the Starbucks.  There is some parking on the street (good luck), but there is a ton of parking behind the stores where you have room to move and don't have to dodge oncoming traffic.  \n\nHad I only eaten the Swiss Roll Cake cupcake that I ate in the charming shop (shabby chic with LOTS of color and personality), they would have gotten a 4 and *maybe* even a 5 - it was moist, delicious and full of flavor (a moist chocolate cupcake with marshmallow filling, topped with chocolate icing, a vanilla drizzle and a cut of a swiss cake roll).  Alas, I brought a vanilla/vanilla home and it was terrible.  The icing was okay, with a baby bear quantity (juuuust right) on top, but the cake was bad.  Dry, odd flavored.  Just bad.  I ate about two bites and threw the rest out.  I have a chocolate with vanilla icing still in the box, and I am in no hurry to eat that after the vanilla/vanilla - it was bleh.\n\nThey also had gluten free cupcakes, cake pops and iced sugar cookies.  Beverages available and reasonably priced.  My 3 cupcakes were put in a sturdy box.\n\n4 stars for the Swiss Cake cupcake, 1 for the vanilla/vanilla, 4 for the shop with friendly employees.  It was just over $10 for the 3 cupcakes.  If I find myself in Ft Mill again, I would stop in for a Swiss Cake, but I won't be making a special trip."
2,"Though the outside was dingy and deserted-looking, the inside was only mildly better.  One side of the restaurant is darkly-lit and is a full bar with TVs showing sports.  The other side is more brightly-lit and is the more formal part of the restaurant, which is where we sat.\n\nFood was ok.  I had the linguine primavera, though my husband fared better with his calzone.  My guess is their pizzas and calzones are better than the rest of the menu.  My ceasar salad came out with parmesan shaken from one of those cans...not fresh.  I found that to be very funny at the time (the cheap wine helped), but I wouldn't order it again.\n\nService was ok.  Our waitress was nice and although she didn't know the menu well, she was apologetic and quick to find out the answers to our questions.\n\nSo, overall I'm giving it three stars...cheap wine, ok food, and the odd assortment of individuals in the bar area providing entertainment give this restaurant a weird charm...but it won't be my first choice of places to eat."
4,"As I was new to this area, I wanted to try this place since I had heard so many positive things about it.\n\nWhen you first walk in, the place looks small.  You have a great view of the kitchen (not one of the positives, in my opinion).  Also, the food menu is listed on chalk boards above the kitchen, which is fine, unless you want to know the ingredients.  They do have regular menus, but it appears we had to ask for one, as opposed to being offered one. We were personally served by the owner, whom was very friendly and charismatic.  He suggested we do \""around the world,\"" which was tapas-style eating with their appetizer menu.  We had originally ordered the crab cakes, sweet chili & bacon prawns (prawns w/ cream cheese, bacon, sweet chili sauce), and rolled New York (thin NY strip steak wrapped around grilled asparagus and provolone); however, we were soon informed that they had ran out of crab cakes, so we switched for the artichoke hearts.  He also offered us the scallops, the daily special, on a complimentary basis. We also shared half orders of house and Caesar salads and a half order of the Chef Al's Favorite Rigatoni.  The owner then also offered us a piece of cheesecake and dessert drinks free of charge to end our evening.\n\nAll of the food was amazing - everything was flavorful and also unique.  My favorite appetizer was the sweet chili & bacon prawns.  The sweet chili sauce was unlike anything I had ever had before.  Of course, anything with bacon also gets high ratings in my book.  The rolled New York was also interesting since I had never heard of rolled steak, but it was a good alternative to ordering a full steak (which they had available as well).  The salads were also flavorful - tasty dressings - and the pasta was amazing.  The fried zucchini garnishes and garlic cloves definitely made the dish.  Also, the cheesecake was extremely flavorful, better than cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.\n\nI was extremely impressed with the customer service.  The owner offered great suggestions and I was grateful for the complimentary items.  I will definitely be visiting this place again!\n\nIt also offers takeout and apparently there is another location on West Tropicana.  You can also sign up to receive special offers via email or text, which (according to the owner) includes specials such as free bottles of wines, free dinners for 4, etc."
0,"Seriously drives me crazy, there is so much potential here, but!!! Every time, horrible service, very disorganized... We have a 45 minute wait for a 2 top, but then people who get here 30 min after us sit right down... This place needs to get there act together!"
2,I'm\n\nNot a huge fan of Claim Jumper it's a fun time but the food isn't all it's cracked up to be.. When we went it was kind of dead and it's such a big space that you figured they could have done more .. I wasn't a big fan of the way it is layed out..\n\nHowever that being said our waiter was awesome and very friendly and our food came at a timely manner.. I would indeed come back again to grab a drink or watch the game but not just for the food..
0,stopped in for breakfast today and the food was cold. the chicken was old and tasted so nasty.\n\nwill not return
3,"I totally dig this place. In reno our 50's diner was taken over by a middle eastern owner who insisted on replacing burgers with falafal so finding Sharis which is a hop and skip down the street from us was like divine intervention lol. Theyre 4.95 burger specials hit the spot and always taste good. Last time I had a flamingo, which is cherry 7up with true vanilla ice cream. This is a great place for kids because it is quiet and the older crowd typically fawn over lucy. She can have the whole bench to herself and rock out to classic tunes from the juke box. Last time my wife took our daughter theyre she got a cool oreo milk cup.\nMy only complaints are they close to early on Sundays and the owners I love Jesus and other godly things scattered about on the walls and shirts of the employees as well as the church day they have kinda cramp my style. Now Im buddhist, so really everyone should be able to practice they're faith as they so choose however I do like it forced upon me at a public eating establishment. Im just very thankful that the owner is chill with me and my lesbian partner and our gayby. \nOhh btw its cool when they have a pin up waitress that serves you. Makes it more authentic!"
0,"It was my worst nightmare !!! Yo have not parking spot after 8 pm the neighbors used to heard very loud music and nobody cares, if you need to fix you AC it is gonna take about one week so be prepare for melt... And when you finally move out and you think this is over.... By the time that you are suppose  to pick up your deposit security, you must feel lucky if they told you that you own money instead !! Don't do it!!!"
2,"I was actually surprised that the good old Silver Bowl is kept up better than I expected. I was thinking it would be really runned down and dirty, but it seems like there has been minor renovations throughout the years and the facility was overall clean.  I had been coming here annually for the CCSD half time show review, which showcases all the high school marching bands. When I was younger my parents and I would watch my brother take on the field and then it was my turn when I entered high school. Those were truly my fondest memories of Sam Boyd. However, after many years of being a UNLV student, my first football game was last year at the UNLV UNR rivalry game. Man oh man, was it fun! I had heard about how fun the tail gate and actual game is and I was pretty stoked to be finally going. After being born and raised in Las Vegas, I could tell that this is Nevada at it's finest. The fireworks add to the excitement when UNLV scored a touch down. Fist pumping the other rebel fans in the stands (even if they were strangers) added to the fun. Although UNLV lost, it was still an enjoyable experience. All I can say is I will certainly be back next year for the rivalry game, GO REBELS!"
1,"This place was ok. I wasn't much of a fan of the atmosphere or the food. It was just all ok. The service was slow, but very friendly. The servings here are HUGE. You'll immediately recognize the regulars because they are the ones sharing one entr\u00e9e. I ordered a pasta dish and they had to have emptied an entire box of linguine in the pot for my dish. And it came with two whole pieces of chicken breast. It was just too much food for one person. I wish instead of offering such large portions they would just give me a little less of something really good instead of a whole lot of something forgettable. The gourmet burger was pretty boring as well. But the onion rings were pretty good, plus!\n\nI actually regretted not having just gone to Olive Garden instead. We won't be back."
1,"So far this is lunch (See pic). My To-go order is taking forever.... Of the one California roll and 4 pieces of salmon. I prepaid, why? I would have left."
3,"This is the Mediterranean version of a Chipotle in the sense that you pick out what you want each step of the way. All of the ingredients were very fresh. I had a wrap with some tabbouleh and fresh red cabbage.  The chicken was a little chewy, but everything else was delicious.  My favorite part was the vegetable salad they put in my wrap.  It had fresh cucumber in it and it was a perfect lunch on a hot day. The service was very quick and the restaurant was comfortable."
1,"Wrong order, rude manager after she found out they messed up my order, she just left me at the drive through. I had to remind myself that I'm saved!"
2,Fun patio.
0,"Company really pumps up how wonderful they are and how they care for customers, yet do not stand up to their promises. They did a mediocre job with our roof leak and when we inquired about additional work they sent an incompetent referral to us who looked over job request and never came back. When we called them back they never returned our calls.  Very disappointed with what they deliver. Which isn't much."
0,"Horrible. Never go here. \nThe atmosphere is ok but it's just like any other quick service chain restaurant, except it seemed over staffed but that didn't help with the food quality or time it took to get our food. \n\nThree of us decided to get breakfast one morning and spent over 40 dollars on stuff that would have cost less than 20 at Denny's, and more like 5-8 dollars at Safeway. \n\nMy '12 ounce Americano with room for cream' was filled up just a little past the 4 ounce point. I had to send it back because it's not what I ordered and my friend sent back her Carmel latt\u00e9. \n\nAll our food was cold and took a long time to get to our table, not to mention it was bland and flavorless. How do you mess up 10 dollar eggs, fruit and toast? I'm not sure, but they managed to pull it off. \n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME. GROSS. SAD. EXPENSIVE. SLOW."
1,"Factory... That's what going here feels like! I've been seeing Dr Geary for about 3 yrs... She's fine, nothing special.  The office is big and soulless ...You're put on an assembly line and everyone just goes through the motions!  Try and ask for something different and the whole system comes to a halt... ( I asked to schedule multiple procedures for one visit... You'd think I asked to see the pope).  The procedures aren't that painful but scheduling is done to maximize their bottom line which is painful to my pocketbook."
1,"Had this for lunch recently, and it was meh.  I had the california burger with the fresh chips. The chips were tasty (although I prefer the kind at Omelette House, they are a bit thicker). The burger was a standard burger, prepared as described.  Nothing knocked my socks off, but nothing was awful either.\n\nService was prompt, but imperfect.  My companion ordered an iced tea with no lemon.  The waitress returned with it in about 20 seconds, with a lemon on top. No big deal, but it's an indicator.\n\nThere were two other observations:\n\n1. The pricing was a bit steep given the current economy.  NO burger is worth $10.  My regular haunt (Lakes Lounge) is half the price, with excellent service, and imho better food.  With that said, the place was packed when I got there at noon, so I guess they don't need to lower their prices.\n\n2.  The menu would lead one to believe that they are control freaks.  I went in wanting to get breakfasty food, but breakfast was not available after 11a.  This is the first pub I have run into that doesn't have a decent breakfast special for $4-5 that is available 'round the clock.  I mean, it's frickin' eggs, right?  It's worth noting that the burger I ordered comes with 2 fried eggs.  I looked at the other side of the menu, and the dinner menu was also time-restricted.  I get that, I suppose, as many of the items are not quick-makes.  Anyway, I went in hoping for one thing, and ended up settling for an ok burger."
3,"On a Friday night with nothing else going on, we decided to try a new place in our quest to find the best pizza in Phoenix.  LAMP is a little out of the way in North Scottsdale, but it looked good.  It was a little more crowded than I expected, and after 15 minutes or so, we were able to get a table.\n\nLAMP is a mid sized venue with an upscale feel (the area is fairly insulated from any normal working class neighborhoods), with a very open food preparation area, as wood-fired pizza restaurants tend to be.\n\nI went with the Gem (red pizza with sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, garlic, and oregano), and my friend had the Geppetto (white pizza with sausage, gorgonzola, and caramelized onion marmelade).  According to the menu, all of their sausage comes from the fantastic De Falco's Italian Deli in south Scottsdale.\n\nThe crust was excellent, and I really liked my pie.  Often when I get pepperoni on a pizza, the flavor overwhelms all the other ingredients and completely ruins it (I'm reminded of the terrible pie I had at LGO).  On this one, it was just right.  The sauce was delicious as well.\n\nI tried the white pie, and I didn't like it as much.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't seem that special.\n\nAlso tried the ricotta cheesecake for dessert, and it was delectable.  I think I really like this concept of using ricotta instead of cream cheese.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good chunky New York cheesecake, but I guess the Italians do it better.\n\nMy biggest complaint about LAMP is the dining experience - the place does feel a bit cold and pretentious.  It probably goes with the North Scottsdale territory, but it lacks the welcoming air that Phoenix's smaller pizza restaurants enjoy."
3,"I felt like I was teleported back to the Middle East for a bit.\n\nWhen you walk into Sinbad's it doesn't take a Middle-Easterner to realize that this is an authentic, family-run joint.  It smells good and they are making fresh bread even in the midst of lunch time.  \n\nI ordered the special: two Gyro's for $5.  Trust me, I know Gyro's are Greek (typically referred to as Shawarma's in Arabic and made with Arabic pita's instead of Greek ones), but that's how they advertised and made them.  However, they had plenty of options available in Arabic jargon and fresh pitas for sale too.  The interior is very basic, with simple tables next to an open kitchen and Arabic televison playing in the background.  \n\nThe Gyro itself was pretty good.  It tasted fresh and came with plenty of fixings, but it was missing a bit more meat.  The service was a bit slow (but I lend that to the authenticity) and very cordial.  \n\nI hope that this will not be my last time here and I put my stamp of approval on Sinbad's for the time being!"
3,"The theatre is very beautiful, and there is a huge choice in movie times, and  there are arcade games and such while you're waiting. However, I don't like how parts of the theater are VIP seating, and it limits seating, especially critical when you're trying to watch a highly desired movie."
4,"Two days into a five day stay in Vegas, we were looking for someplace other than the always overrated hotel buffet for breakfast.  Our parking valet saw our perplexed looks and asked what we needed.  When replied \""breakfast\"" he immediately suggested \""The Egg & I\"".  We plugged it into our GPS and boy, were we glad we did!  This place is the best.  Since we were there during the week, there was no wait but busy.  The menu was so extensive my husband and I took at least 10-15 minutes just to read and decide.  We wanted EVERYTHING!  I went for the Piggy Skillet and was absolutely overwhelmed.  It was fabulous.  My husband and I were so pleased with the food and service, we made sure this was the last place we ate before leaving town.  And I took a banana nut muffin on the plane home. I wanted to buy a whole loaf but my husband gave me a dirty look.  I gained four pounds while I was in Vegas and I am sure three of them were courtesy of The Egg & I!"
2,"Facility is nice, staff is mainly awesome. there's always that 1 or 2 people who forget they work in a club......unfortunately its a very sales orientated atmosphere. It's pricey but since I have a child, adding her to my membership is worth the cost. If it were just for me, I would definitely be somewhere else. The amenities for kids is what makes this place awesome. Child care staff is great!! there is a ton of elliptic machines if your into that. Free weights is totally lacking & needs improved but its not what this gym caters to."
2,"I have passed it 50 times or so and finally I stopped in to check it out. Well it was nothing like I expected once I opened the door. The place is crammed with dusty Texas stuff from the ceiling down the walls and on the counters. It's a bit over done for my taste. \nThe bar sits back from the door along one wall and is small and cramped all other seating appeared to be cramped booths. They offer daily supper specials, but on this evening it was the least appealing of them all. Wednesday Supper Special is Liver & Onions, I don't do Liver & Onions. Instead I had dessert! All desserts are $3.50 unheard of in restaurants anymore! I had the Homemade Hill Country Peach Cobbler, it comes warm so for an extra buck I went A La Mode and had a hefty scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. It's a real tasty cobbler and a good size one as well. Tammy the bartender was friendly and quick to serve as well as chat with ya. All the staff seemed pretty easy going and TEXAZ friendly. The menu has a tasty looking line up for both lunch and dinner. Lunch (mostly $7) is substantially less than dinner ($12 - $20) in prices. But one time or another I'll be back to try that awesome looking chicken fried steak or some fried fish or some BBQ spareribs. The place seems mighty fine for down home Texan cookin and it hasn't got a Good Ole Boys feel to it at all, as one person had told me it would."
1,"I went one time for maternity clothes, though I was pretty disappointed in their maternity selection.  I'll echo other reviewers' experiences with the staff - they're pretty uninterested in the customers.  Personally, I don't like overbearing, hovering staff, but they were a little too hands-off.  It didn't matter, though.  The maternity clothes were about as awful as anywhere.  The selection was pretty poor - and who is wearing those itty-bitty short things?  Tiny Scottsdale women who barely have a bump?  Maybe I should have made a few more visits.  I managed to find 2 shirts at OK prices."
4,"Just ate breakfast at JP Pancake for the first time. I went with my 5 year old son an he had a great time with the little games on the tables and ate everything in his plate! He had the scrambled eggs, sourdough toast, and home fries with a size of bacon. I had the house buttermilk pancakes and they were FANTASTIC! The owners were very nice as well. I will be returning with my husband and other children... Highly recommended!"
1,The burger here is cheap at $4.95. It comes with potato salad on the side or you can pay extra for French fries. The burger meat tasted old and yucky. The fries were good though. The price is cheap though and it's on Fremont.
3,Long wait but the food was very good.  Cheese curds were wonderful.  They ran out of hot dogs which was surprising.
1,"This restaurant has a much smaller menu for a Thai place. It makes it simple to look through, but I was hoping for a new favorite of mine, the Thai Soya fish, and they didn't have it on their menu. I opted for the grilled seafood which states on the menu that it comes on a bed of vegetables with Thai hot sauce. What it turned out to be was a combination of shrimp, scallops, calamari, and fish on top of....lettuce, with Thai hot sauce. So essentially a fish salad. The shrimp, scallop, and calamari were tasty, but the fish was awful. Dry, fishy-tasting. I couldn't eat it. Their fresh roll appetizer was pretty good but not the best I've ever had.\nI didn't think my meal was worth the $15 price tag, and just so you know ahead of time this establishment does not have a liquor license in case you are looking for cocktails or Thai beer to accompany your dinner. \nClean bathrooms. Decent service-our water was repeatedly filled, but for the food itself I would not return when there are so many other choices in the valley."
2,"Reasonably good curry, although not as good as the reviews on the window claim.  I agree with the other reviews that it promises more than it really delivers."
0,"We went here to find a Sig firearm to buy and noone wanted to help us at all.  They seemed to just ignore us and when we finally had to ask for help, the guy behind the counter gave us a attitude as if we were bothering him.  We ended up leaving and will never be back.  Not sure if they treat everyone like that but from the other Yelp reviews, they seems to not care about locals and about getting business I guess,"
0,"Went here tonight with friends for trivia. I ordered an ice tea and a personal Vegetable Kaiser Pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland and greasy. The ice tea was horrible even with sweetener. I will continue attending for trivia, but will seek food elsewhere."
0,"I called up to see if this place Sandwich Max was a chain and they said no.  So I went in to try it.  I will tell you I have been in the deli/supermarket business 30years and know what a good sub is.  I have had too many to even think twice that this was the worst sub EVER!  I dont mean to be critical but there was no meat on my italian hero, but a pound of lettuce and tomato.  Same owners I believe as sub station so he can do what he wants.  Dont waste your money like I did!  Absolutely terrible sandwich, no wonder why there were 5 people eating at lunchtime."
2,"I've actually never had Art's barbecue (though I love that they spell \""barbecue\"" with a \""c\"" - a man after my own heart).  I've only been here for breakfast.\n\nI realize these days that your breakfast fare is generally split into two categories - fast food, that you can put onto bread of some kind and then the sort that you put on a plate.  Of course you have some leeway in there, but that will generally cover it.\n\nArt's, naturally, falls into the latter category, offering eggs and meat plates of various styles, and will typically pack in the parking lot.  You simply order at the counter and a few minutes later you are all set with a plate of piping hot breakfast, ready-to-go!\n\nService is friendly to boot!"
1,It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal.  We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on.  We got a 'can't we get you to stay' call which felt like desperation on their part.  My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left (as most do) and the cost was not worth it anymore.  I would not recommend them to my friends.
1,"I normally don't write reviews but I just had to after my experience last night. Pretty much in a nutshell, it's 9pm on a Thurs, my husband & I go to get a quick bite. My Arnold Palmer was disgustingly tart, the bread was borderline stale, & service a joke. I order off their holiday special menu with all the wine dishes. It was the shrimp & scallop linguine in champagne cream sauce (with roasted red peppers & mushrooms). It takes longer to arrive than usual, by another waitress, so when a plate of shrimp a la vodka over linguine (simply shrimp, pasta & diced tomatoes in vodka sauce) is placed in front of me naturally I think she made a mistake. Nope! In her words, \""they ran out of the champagne sauce so they used the vodka cream sauce instead.\"" OH DID THEY? Glad I was consulted in the decision making of what I'll be eating for dinner. I guess at Carrabba's the customer doesn't get to chose what they eat. The best part was when our server suddenly appeared after his long break with no apology or explanation. Oh & no manager either. Yea it's safe to say we'll never return."
3,"Being a fair distance off the beaten track for tourists and far enough away from the main student areas of town, Clars Bar attracts a large contingency of local residents rather than tourists or students. Me and my flatmates came here after signing our lease for our flat at DJ Alexander just down the road.\nThe place had quite a nice appearance about it with lots of wood wherever you looked and seemed quite cosy and the clientelle seemed really friendly as did the staff. \nThere were lots of drinks on tap including several real ales. It would be good to come here to watch a football or rugby match as I could imagine the atmosphere would get pretty intense in here. If I was more local to here I would definitely come more often."
0,"Competent tech, got the unit running, good response, very expensive. Charges $80 per pound for R-22 freon when the current contractor purchase price is $11 per pound. If gas stations charged the same mark up, gas would be $24 per gallon. Suggest getting other quotes Fountain Hills."
3,"Kids had a great time. The lodge and water area are pretty clean since it's only 2 yrs old. We got the kids cabinn suite since we were a family of 5 and it was perfect. I would recommend as a weekend family trip, not much longer."
1,"I made a catering phone order last week and was highly disappointed. I purchased 2 trays of the mini sandwiches. When I picked them up, I was told that they are best eaten fresh and that the bread would get hard if they are left out. Considering I had 2.5 hours until my event, I asked how to best preserve them. They said I would be unable to and not eating them right away could result in them getting stale. Basically, I ended up giving the trays to friends while they were still hot and not using them for my event. $65 bucks down the tubes. You think they could have mentioned that to me at the time of my phone order."
2,"Like some others have said, unless you have all night to spend, don't go here. The service is quite slow. The food, on the other hand, was pretty good. I would have given them 4 stars were it not for the slow as molasses service. I wish restaurants would read these reviews so that they could improve themselves and make the customer experience better."
4,"Great place for all alterations!  I relocated to Madison from Chicago and needed a place to help me with a bridesmaid's dress fitting.  The dress had a lot of lace, making the alterations slightly more complicated than meets the eye.  \n\nDarlene did a GREAT job.  The dress fits like a glove.  Woo hoo!  I will definitely be back with any future alteration needs."
0,"Horrible place to take your children!!! The staff is very rude, to say the least! Management could care less about any complaints and the refs are very strict and unbecoming. Recently a young girl broke her arm because refs allowed kids that they know to skate out of control. I stopped taking my 4 year old here about 8 months ago because of this type of behavior, also since one of the refs that are still currently employed had threatened to fight me in the parking lot, and assumed that it might be different now but was shown the same as before. I will never come to this skating rink again. Hopefully the staff is better at the Boulder Hwy location."
1,"Our first meal in Scottsdale was at Bacon--and interestingly enough bacon seemed to become the theme of our entire trip. Bacon chocolate chip cookies, bacon brittle, bacon-infused vodka, and bacon Bloody Mary's? They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We ended up ordering one of their special bacon eggs Benedict with a Mornay sauce to share, plus a side of fruit, and the main reason we'd come here: the Bacon Bloody Mary.\n\nWhile my sweetie was in the restroom, his Bacon Bloody Mary arrived. It looked great, even though Bloody Mary's are not my thing, with a nice stalk of celery and some pimento-stuffed olives. But something seemed to be missing. Hmm, what could it be? Well, unless the bacon had been blended up along with the other ingredients, it was the BACON that was missing in the BACON Bloody Mary! Bacon FAIL!\n\nWe mentioned this to our server when he brought our food and he was properly dumbfounded and apologetic--yet he never brought a slice of bacon to garnish the drink, nor did he offer us another Bloody Mary. Huh?\n\nHe redeemed himself, however, when he brought us a quarter of a fresh pineapple studded with fresh strawberries that we hadn't ordered. He explained that when he'd seen the pitiful 1/4 cup of barely-ripe cantaloupe the chef had put on the pass, he'd said he couldn't serve just that to us.\n\nI'd be willing to try Bacon again when I'm in town next, especially since they included a $5 off coupon with our check, but neither the food nor the service stood out on this visit."
1,"I took Melissa's car to the dealer for service today.  After a few hours sitting in the waiting room and listening to light hits ranging from Kelly Clarkson to Enrique Iglesias my stomach began to grumble.  I perused the vending machines and initially considered going with the BigAZ Bubba Twins\u2122 Chili Dogs until I came to my senses and decided to venture out into the world in search of sustenance.  Across the street I spied what looked like ancient adobe dwellings.  As I got closer a sign indicated that it was the dilapidated ruins of Pappago Plaza.  Through my explorations of the prehistoric temple to the gods of home furnishings and strip mall bars, I was drawn to both the British Open Pub and the Hometown Buffet next door, but neither was right for a meal before noon.  Just as I was about to give up on my quest I spied a single word that drew me in...PIZZA.  \n\nAs I walked closer I noticed the magic words...\""2 slices for 3.99\"" and I was sold.  I entered the tiny hut and it appeared to be empty.  After a few seconds the phone rang and a tiny Italian man stepped out from behind a door.  He answered the phone and spoke something I didn't understand in a thick Italian accent.  After hanging up he asked me what I wanted, at which point I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of pepperoni and a Pepsi.  After giving him my $5.27 he retreated behind the door from which he came and I took a seat at one of the 2 tables in the cramped and poorly maintained hut.  After a few minutes he returned with my slices.  \n\nThe slices were good size, but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust.  I went in search of spices (a must for any good Pizza joint) and found only red pepper and parmesan.  Disappointed, I started with the cheese slice.  It was a bit on the chewy side, sort of like a poor man's Hungry Howie's, but was very bland and without the flavored crust.   As for the pepperoni, they were limp and soggy and tasted like some dog treats smell.   By that I mean it's intriguing to the point where you almost want to eat it, but you know it's not a good idea.  Luckily they were easily removed to convert it back into another bland cheese slice.  The best part was probably the crust, which was soft and tasty and could have been great with the right dipping sauce.  \n\nI returned from my quest having not discovered any hidden treasure, but at least alive and with a full stomach...which is more than I can probably say if I had gone with the chili dogs!"
2,"We did a yelp and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  It's up past both the Rio and the Palms in a strip mall.\n\nHubby and I both ordered pho.  Good broth and meat and noodle portions.  \n\nIf you check in on yelp, you can redeem the deep fried two spring rolls offer.  \n\nLots of locals so it's gotta be good."
4,"This place was surprisingly good! Got shot down from Coco Cafe...2 hr wait so this was plan B. It was busy and only one waitress yet service was still excellent. I had the Mona Style eggs with hot tea and it was delicious. Convenient location and inexpensive. Parking is only on street though and if it's not Sunday, it's not free."
1,"This place is only packed and busy because tourists are directed here for Chinese food....\n\nStay away, greasy and not that great.\n\nService sucks ass too... took 15 minutes before anyone came by to take our order.\n\nBah."
0,"Prostitutes, incompetent employees, roaches, dirty carpet, must I go on?! This place is a real dump and I will NEVER be staying here again! As I drove into the parking lot I noticed prostitutes and their johns walking in and out of the room. One prostitute walked into the lobby to check in as three guys waited for her in their truck. ALL three then walked into the room as I sat there waiting for check in time. I can't believe these Traveldoge employees would allow this unless they are getting a piece of the pie. \n\nWhen I finally walk in to check in, the incompetent Mexican ladies take my credit card and with a smug smile tells me, \""You're card declined\"". I clearly knew this was bullshit and called my bank. While I was on the phone I told her that my bank said my credit card is in good standing and there was no sign of the merchant event trying to charge my card. After the 5th time of her swiping my card she asked some other lady why it wasn't working then the problem was solved. She didn't even explain what mistake she was doing or even apologize for wasting my time. \n\nAs I walked into the room I noticed the bad smell and dirty carpets. Later that night I found 2 huge roaches just crawling on the carpet. Also, noisy drug dealers fighting with prostitutes at 6AM when I just crawled into bed from partying all night is not what I want to hear."
2,"Cool for Vegas. Seems like Orange County, but not in a bad way."
1,"Horrible service...forgot to bring me my mustard I asked for (had to ask twice) and then forgot to bring our J\u00e4ger bombs! No thanks, glad I'm just passing through and will never be back"
2,"I went there for brunch, I don't think it's really a breakfast/brunch spot, felt more like an Irish pub and probably best for drinks at night. I had Low Country Hash, which was alright, but not worth $12... It seemed more like a side than a main dish. Staff was ok, but when I asked for a hot sauce, I was told where it was, instead of bringing it to me, I don't mind getting it on my own, but still... Interior was quite cool: exposed brick walls and interesting decorations, will need to go there again just for beers or something, cause I wasn't very impressed with brunch"
2,so we went here for my friends bachelor party and wow we walked right in and this place was dead..no one was there...the place was really small inside...decor was okay i guess...we hung out for a hr and started downing drinks and the place started to get poppin.  that when it got pretty fun...if you are looking to get into a club fast then check this place out...will i go back...i dont know really..we will see
0,I initially went to the mall for a duvet cover and had trouble finding one for an affordable price. Most were over $150. I remembered seeing Holy Sheets so I stopped in. They had a few listed at $140 on sale for $80. I was hesitant so they said they'd go down to $40. SOLD!  Plus I got another sheet set for $40. I thought I scored. Don't get me wrong the sheets are soft. They're definitely NOT 1500 thread count. ( you can see right through them) I was at another store today looking at sheets and they had the EXACT same packaging but different label!! FOR $15!!! This place is crap!! Reminded me of the ppl that sell sheets and blankets on the corners in east Vegas. Save your money and go to Marshall's...
1,"What a disappointment. I had read the reviews, which were mixed, but since I was in the area I decided to give it a try and I'm sad that I did. \n\nI ordered the gumbo, a crab melt type appetizer, and the banana cream pie. The gumbo was average, I've had much better before at other places. The crab melt appetizer was disgusting- I ordered it based on the recommendation of the waitress. It is crab in some mayonnaise like sauce that you are supposed to spread on these crostinis that they give you. The sauce didn't taste very good- too sweet- and the crab tasted fishy. \n\nOverall, the only redeeming thing about the meal was the famous banana cream pie. I overheard the waitress telling other people that some people go here just to have that alone. I was thinking- what a great idea- that is what I should have done! So keep it in mind."
3,"Never had Greek food before but was stopped and offered a sample of the grilled chicken and was it rated good so we figured why not?  The menu had a lot of things and with me being indecisive I would've been sitting there forever trying to figure out what everything was.  The lady in front of me ordered the grilled chicken over rice plate and said it's really good so I went with it.  I was still a little weary of the sauce that came with it since I wasn't sure if I would like it but decided to just take it as is.  I was glad I did! The chicken was moist and had good flavor, the veggies were fresh and seasoned good and the rice with the sauce was light and really good too!  I finished the whole thing and didn't feel bloated or grossed out, definitely a good choice for food court food if you don't want deep fried, heavy, greasy foods.  The employees were really nice too, good restaurant quality food in a food court mall.  Still crave it once in a while."
0,"You couldn't pay me to stay here but having said that it's always interesting to walk through the place and look at the sort of people who DO stay here. Room rates here are low but certainly not the \ncheapest in town. Lots of better options at this price. So why are\nthey here these people? What attracts them? I honestly feel some\nfolks are attracted by sleaze. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Maybe a few are history buffs and have a strong desire to stay in one of the original Strip hotels,a resort that was here in the days of\nMeyer Lansky,Howard Hughes and the Rat Pack. And there are parts\nof the Riviera that look as if they haven't been cleaned since the 60's.\nSorry to be so negative."
2,"When I worked at the mall, which seems like ages ago, we would always come to Z'Tejas for their amazing margaritas and chile con queso.  This time my bf and I went there for some lunch while running errands at the mall.  The food was just A-Ok...nothing amazing!  We both had appetizers and then shared a dessert.  The dessert was served extra hot which caused us to both burn our tounges....OUCH! \n\nNow for the weird part...our server was creepy!  I dont know if he was just socially awkward or just really trying hard to be friendly.  We never received the cornbread we were told was coming 3 times.  And he just tried to start up weird conversation that really didnt make any sense.  It left me feeling in a hurry to get out of there.\n\nAll in all it was ok, it wont be the first place I think of to eat unless I want someplace away from the noise of the mall."
2,"Flavors was one of the Buffets included with the Buffet of Buffets  I ate there for breakfast.  They had food.  The line was reasonable.  The food for breakfast was decent.  \n\nNothing jumped out and smacked me in a way that made me take notice, but nothing jumped out and smacked me in a way that made me take notice either.\n\nSometimes, a consistent, average meal, that you can count on is what you need.  If you are hungry, Flavors has some food.  Some of it has flavor.  Some of it does not have flavor, which, in the scheme of things, is still happy, because I encountered nothing at all with bad flavor, which means the day I ate there I said:\n\n\""Today was a good day....\"""
2,"I've had the chance to stay at PH on several occasions, in both the regular rooms and the huge suites.  The hotel has a hip, glitzy vibe going on.  It's decorated in a sleek and modern fashion.  The rooms are spacious but not as big as Venetian's or Palazzo's.  The suite on the other hand was huge with all the amenities, 3 flatscreens, billiards table, 3 bathrooms, bar area, separate dining area, etc.  I like that there's a mall attached to the casino.  There's been a couple of times were I forgot to pack something and had to run downstairs and over to Sephora, Steve Madden, or H&M.  I also love that there's a Starbuck's in the casino since I always need my daily latte fix.  My two biggest gripes about PH is that I don't get cell phone reception (a lot of people don't) downstairs in the lobby and valet area and that valet always takes forever, sometimes 20-45 minutes.  I've gotten to the point where I self park in the mall and just walk through.  \n\nI did have one unusually bad experience at PH.  In one weekend, our room's TV broke, toilet broke, there was glitter all over the carpet (as if housekeeping totally skipped vaccumming), and crumbs in the bed (resulting in a rash all over when we got home, I hope they were crumbs).  Another weird thing I noticed about this hotel is little things break easily.  Once, I touched the bathroom door handle and the thing fell off in my hand.  I hung a dress on the edge of a chair and the end of it fell off.  Little things but notable, so dock a star.  Also, there's no pool.\n\nAnyway, I like this hotel.  It's not my favorite but I'd still stay here if I got a good deal.  Be sure to sign up for the player's card and they keep sending you all types of good deals on room rates, show tickets, and dining coupons."
4,"Wow! Great find. Got to airport early to escape the craziness of the Strip. What a peaceful juxtaposition! Little seating areas are great - plenty of room and outlets.\n\nThe food was interesting and delish! We were so surprised to see dishes from celebrity chef Scott Conant (Scarpetta, etc) - (great vegan soup and fingerling potatos). Also loved the local element (yellow beets!) \ntoo. This kind of fresh creative food is wonderfully unexpected at the airport. \n\nWhat a find!"
4,"AMAZING! I had a friend that had a professional bra fitting and told me it would change your life! I made an appointment and she was right! I was wearing a totally different bra size then I measured in the store.  The owner was totally relaxed and friendly.  I'm not very self-conscious, so I wasn't worried about the actual fitting part, but low key.  The store is beautiful! You can really tell Katherine loves what she is doing.  She spent over one hour with me trying on several bra styles.  I purchased three and it was so well worth the money! I feel great and cannot believe I walked around for all these years wearing the wrong size bra.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"
2,Not a bad layout for a large airport.  Lots of convenience here.  Lots of places to shop and eat which makes it nice if you're having to lay over for more than an hour.  I don't like monster airports.
1,"Always really liked their pizza, but too many bad customer service experiences with rude staff have led us to order elsewhere. Also the online ordering system has had serious issues as others have stated. This is Phoenix, there are too many other options."
1,"This was stop #4 on our night uptown/downtown.  I paid $8 for small plastic cups of John Daly which is ridiculous.  However, my friend bought a blue Panthers shot, and they gave me a free one because they said I had to drink one too which was nice. It was all right, but I could have spent the entire night at BlackFinn instead!"
3,"Orange Table is one of my go-to spots in the valley.  The food and atmosphere are superb.  The wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens OT's menu when pairing food and drink.\n\nI will admit that while the location may seem hard to find, there are times where I've had to wait, and wait...but if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait.\n\nTheir salads and burgers (especially the wine burger w/ cheese and red onion) are fantastic!"
0,"Worst dining experience ever! McDonald's has a more inviting atmosphere. Wait time was awful. We went on Friday night, sat outside for a few until the roaches asked us to go inside. A lot of roaches in the outside dining area. Then it was one thing after the other, food cold and average, staff cold and average. I suggest not spending the money, too much for nothing. Try anything, and it would be much better than this experience. They need restaurant impossible to come and train the wait staff. Horrible experience! Wasted my time and my money."
1,"I was super excited for a country bar, but this was not what I was expecting.  A group of friends and myself waited for a little bit in a line we got in..it smelled like garbage and was way too hot.  The beer was an okay price and I love country music so one star is worthy I guess.  None of the staff looked or acted remotely happy, and if you weren't awkwardly dancing with someone on the floor, you were standing with your group of friends looking around...also awkwardly.  If you weren't drunk, you just were having an awkward time...so we left an went somewhere else where the environment was more pleasant.\nBUT...I will probably give it one more try & possibly update my review."
4,"Best \""dogs\"" in town. You need to try the Italian Beef. Worth the trip!"
4,"This is THE ONLY place that I will go for pancakes! They are so buttery, smooth and heavenly. The potatoes are also a must have. \n\nFor the rare occasions that I decide no pancakes at Joe's they have a vegetarian option of eggplant parmesan. It is fantastic! Pair with the slaw and you'll be in heaven. \n\nThe owners also help with serving and they are super nice! As a matter of fact, all of the servers are amazing."
0,This place is rough. The front office is rude and acts like you are bothering them if you enter their office. They seem annoyed if tut want to drop off your rent or pick up a package.  This place needs a total make over.  Should have paid a little more to live down the stteey.
0,"I normally stay in the regular significantally  lower priced hotel/motels whenever I travel. But this hotel experience goes down in my history as THE most disgusting ever. \n\nUpon my arrival to my room I immediately discover these horrible stains and chunky crud on the comforter, that was neatly placed on top of my bed that I paid 114 per night for.  I tried calling the front desk to complain and after about 2 hours of them not answering I finally just called housekeeping to give me clean linens.  When the housekeeper came in, the look on her face was priceless.  I think she was even more disgusted than I was.  She made sure to completely change everything to ensure cleanliness and said she felt embarrassed that her peers didnt catch that before. \n\nAnyway, I didnt have time to deal with the front desk to get upgraded to another room....one because it was a hassle sine they wouldnt answer the phone...and two I was in Vegas for a reason and had plans to attend to.  So I overlooked the burdon of the digusting bed only to discover, after a night out, that the bathroom floor had dried droplets of vomit on he bathroom floor. Need I say more? \n\nIt wasnt just the filthy condition of the expensive room, it was also the fact that the room was severly in need of an overall renovation. The caulking around the tiles in the bathroom was dirty and disentigrating, the shower drained slowly...sure to give you toe fungus and the sink faucet had cruddy crap all around it.\n\nI originally wanted to stay at a $35 a night hotel, but friends convinced me to \""splurge\"". And this is what I get for splurging??? I would expect the actual condition of this room from a cheaper hotel.  \n\nYou may want to rethink your choice of hotel unless you want to deal with the hassle of getting upgraded to a better room. But judging by my friends who had a supposed upgraded room...it was not at all any better."
3,"Great diner food!\nWent for breakfast and had chicken fried steak with eggs over easy,\nWOW it was friggin awesome.Good service too."
4,"Looking to have salad for lunch is how I found this place! The photo on Yelp of their Caprese salad was tempting me, browsed through other pictures, everything looked visually appealing as well. So made the decision to have lunch here and Im very happy I did!\n\nThe food Ive tried so far rocks! Caprese Salad and their Beef Kebabs was my order.\n\nCaprese Salad - Layered with fresh mozz, grilled eggplant and ripe tomatoes and sprinkled with basil. Loved it. The cheese was fresh, creamy and tender. Real simple salad but delish!\n\nBeef Kebabs - There was an option for beef kebabs as a wrap or combo plate with veggies and ricel pilaf. I chose the combo of healthy proteins, starches and veggies.  Beef kebabs were nice thick chunky cuts of nicely seasoned beef that are fired grilled. It also came with a Tahini sauce that was made from scratch for dipping. Loved it! The portion sizes are average and fit the prices they charge which is moderate. Both dishes I had were under $10 each. Which is pretty affordable for the specialties they offer here.\n\nAmbiance/Service - Delightful describes my dining experience!! It's a relaxed feel where Frank Sinatra and 40's tunes are piped in. Cherry-wood tables and chairs. Natural light filters in through the floor to ceiling windows that surround the place. Love the hand painted wall art. How sweet and thoughtful they have a little area dedicated for the little ones to dine/play too, so moms (and or dads ) can relax and unwind a bit with a glass of wine.  \n\nIt's a family owned business. The host/server that initially seated me was at the end of her shift, so Albert and Tony took over and did a great job! I also had the pleasure to meet the Chef Ash and the Bon Chef Cafe crew. All take great pride at what they do and they do it very well!  I cant wait go back to try the Baked Lobster Bisque that's topped off with a puff pastry. I know Im in for a culinary treat when I dine here!"
2,"Service here is extremely poor.  This place does not accept reservations so there is always a 40 minute wait for a table.  No doubt,the food is good but the hostess is always snooty and impatient.  I love their cheese platters and burgers."
0,"I've been a customer at this location for more than four years and while I've never needed to write a negative review,  I've also never been overwhelmed to write a terribly positive review, either. \n\nHere's the rundown and why they only get one star....\n\nThe first few years of my relationship with Nationwide Vision was good -- not great... just good. The Doctors change frequently, so it's difficult to build up any type of history, but I guess that is what a chart is for, right? \n\nFor the record, my eyesight hasn't changed much over the years with the exception of a gradual decline due to age. I am near sighted, no astigmatism, wear contacts and when in the mood I switch to my glasses, and have slight allergies due to hay fever.  All in all, I'm a pretty easy patient.\n\nWhat else hasn't changed in the past 5 years? My health insurance. I've had the SAME benefits, the SAME copay, the SAME EXACT carrier since I've been a patient with Nationwide.\n\nI basically get the same exact brand of contacts every year and can budget accordingly. However, this year I paid $50 more. I brought this to the front desk person's attention, and she insisted I was wrong...\n\nI went home, called insurance company, verified my benefits, went back in to the store to get my refund, and she refused. I showed her - well, I actually drew her a picture, and she refunded me $25. Come to find out, she actually charged me another $25 rather than refunding me, which has caused another nightmare with my FSA carrier, but that's another story for another day.\n\nI called the corporate office and basically got \""into it\"" with that representative. After a solid 10 to 15 minute phone call of bantering back and forth, I gave up and decided that this was definitely a no-win situation.\n\nIf you want to just be a patient with a chart, get what you need quickly (in and out) and possibly be overcharged (with no care of fixing the situation) then feel free to go to Nationwide Vision Center.\n\nFunny thing is, I don't mind being rushed in and out of the eye doctor. What really IRKED me was the overcharging and complacency to even help me get the situation resolved.\n\nSo, what could have been an easy fix, ( I was willing to split the difference and take the $25 and call it good), has now resulted in a disgruntled customer, a crappy YELP rating, and the loss of a five year patient...\n\nCome 2015, I shall be looking for a new eyecare provider (Pun Intended)."
1,"I am torn.  I watched this show on 5/24/13.  The performers, set, and lighting were fantastic.  The theater was nice, the songs were fun.  The sound however, needed some major adjustment.  So two stars it is.  Myself and the rest of the group (there were five of us) had to plug our ears for most of the show to prevent our eardrums from exploding.  The sound was simply too loud to enjoy the concert.  It was just way too unnecessarily loud.  I thought my ears were going to bleed.  It was painful.  I would have given four stars if I didn't have to plug my ears the entire time."
4,"Zen Kitchen is ridiculously good. It serves Asian food without all the horrible additives and MSG that most takeaways offer. This takeaway is a breath of fresh air as the food is so tasty and fresh that you won't believe it is from a takeaway. \n\nMy friend recommended this place on the sly, I think it is one of those \""secret\"" places that everyone hopes will stay secret and awesome. I had Sesame Chicken Fried rice which might be my new favourite Chinese dish, although I haven't seen it on many other Chinese menus. The prices are maybe a tiny little bit more than the average Chinese, but it is so much better.\n\nThe takeout comes in boxes like they do in the States. Nuff said."
1,"While we were circling Chandler Fashion, my husband called the Men's shoe department to see if they had a shoe in his size (Chuck Taylor's, size 14, black or grey).  The associate who took the call wouldn't even go check to see if they had the shoe in stock.  Instead, he immediately stated they didn't have any Chuck Taylor's in size 14.  So, I was frustrated, since we had bought many size 14 pairs from this Nordstrom in a selection of brands.  We felt they probably had the shoe and just were too lazy to check or weren't concerned by the little amount of commission they'd make on the $50 pair of shoes.  So minutes after the call, I went into the store, asked the men's shoe associate (Daniel B.) if they had any converse shoes in 14.  He asked what color, and I told him any color would do.  He went to go check, and brought out 2 pairs (black and white).  What do you know!  Look what a little effort can do!  I bought the black pair.  I left the store and called the store manager (Deb) to explain our less than stellar service.  She said all she could do was apologize for the bad experience.  I made a suggestion; she should discuss customer service with Daniel (or the gentleman) that answered our call.  All to say... if you are desperate for a pair of shoes, don't expect good service from this Nordstrom - go elsewhere!"
1,"I used to really enjoy my meals, but something struck me strange this visit as I noticed the entire menu is gluten-free. Here's the deal: I need to eat gluten-free food, but everyone in the world does not. The reality is, gluten-free pasta does not taste as good as regular pasta. I know; there was a time I ate it and I miss it. Yes, quinoa itself, not as a noodle, is a tasty grain. Corn as itself, not as a noodle, is tasty, so why is everyone in the world now being subject to gluten-free pastas? I had the eggplant parmesan which was not anything to write home about. I always love their Greek salad. Am I missing a point as to why gluten-free?"
4,They have the best Reuben in the area.  There home made chips and ranch dressing are great.  The tomato and mozzarella appetizer is delicious and more like a meal than an appetizer.
4,"i used to not be a very big fan of Subway in-general, but ever since the $2 cold cut combo and meatballs subs in December i have come to love their subs, but the thing is, i have been to several other subway restaurants in phoenix/Scottsdale and the experiences were sorta bad (and I'll get to them in their own review), but of the 10 times i have been to this particular location i have had no issues other than it being 4 miles away from my house\n\nPros: Fast, Friendly service, open 24/7, fresh ingredients, food tastes great\n\nCons: other than the location inconvenience, none whatsoever\n\nConclusion: If you like great tasting subs for a great price i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, and also if you have a bad experience at another location don't blame them all, because their are good locations such as this one!"
4,The specials are ongoing and the food is to die for. The waitstaff is very attentive. They are quick to exchange orders if the food does not meet up with our tastes. Not their fault. I was not aware how spicy it would be and could not eat it. They were very understanding. I don't go on holidays or during busy hours so the wait if any has never been more than 10 min.
4,"This place is amazing!  Quality ingredients and the best service in town.  Oscar is the greatest server!!!  Delish chips and salsa! The food is amazing, the Burrito Tropical with grilled chicken is to die for!! mmhmm"
0,"My friend and I decided to go to this bar for a quick drink before he had to work. We only had 20 minutes to hang out before he started so we quickly sat down and anxiously awaited service. The bar was pretty dead. I saw about 4 bartenders/cocktail girls running around, although I'm not too sure why. There were dirty tables scattered throughout the rather large bar and only about 3 small parties of guests present. We didn't want to be rude and get drinks from the bar since we were planning to hangout in the seated cocktail lounge area. Didn't want to cheat anyone out of a tip. After over 5 minutes of waiting patiently we noticed that a group that had walked in a few minutes after us was already being helped. At this point I lost my patience. This happening AND us being in a hurry was not a good combination. We each ordered 2 cocktails from the bartender then sat back down in our lounge area to drink them both, in the 5 minutes that we had left to kick it. What a f#%@&ing bummer. Ugh."
2,"Pretty decent selection of scrubs, pretty decent prices.  They have a large set of clearance racks where you can find some true bargains."
0,"honestly people? we booked there because of those comment but hey, looks like we hadn't the same experience there. \nthis hotel is such a CRAP. it's dirty, noisy, cold, bed is awful, they touch your clothes in the room, breakfast is disgusting and not fresh at all, wifi never works, front desk is always closed (we've been stucked outside for more than 30 minutes and had to call the booking phone number to know the door code and ask for someone). I tell you, NEVER again."
3,Had the purple burrito. It had a lot of flavor and it was a lot of food. If you are looking for all natural food. This is the place.
3,"Great food and probably the best atmosphere of any Persian restaurant!\n\nMake sure you ask for the price of specials before you order as the stews were far more expensive than the kabob on the menu.  Approximately double the price.\n\nThey bake their own bread, which was fantastic.  The Fesenjoon and Gheimeh Bademjan were delicious!"
3,Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.
3,"A bit more than your typical casino buffet.\n\nFirstly, its hidden towards the north end of the main casino floor before the lobby w/ elevators to 270 Degrees.\n\nThe line moved pretty quickly when we were here: 8:30 on a rainy Sat morning. The seating in this place is very lux for a buffet. And theres plenty of it: both tables w/ chairs and booths. Theres a nice patio and view out the floor to ceiling windows at the north side of the dining room. It looks like theres a small bar here as well, but it wasnt open during our visit. \n\nThe actual buffet room is smaller than a lot of other ones Ive seen, but has a great selection of items. Fruit and breakfast items including slab pepper bacon. Chinese and Mexican items, plenty of breakfast pastries, and cakes/pies. An omelet station (theyre large), and a gelato station (they give you a melon ball sized scoop). The food was pretty good. Id say the omelet was the best thing I had. our waitresses were very attentive at first. There was a 45 minute period where we couldnt find anyone for water or coffee refills though.\n\nOverall, a decent breakfast at a decent price ($9.95 on Sat morning, all you can eat)."
3,$2 Blackjack! ...do I need to explain further?
0,"Automatically lose a star for no Ranch.  You serve pizza and salads--where's the Ranch?!?!\n\nI have been here multiple times for dine in and take out.  Everyone is friendly.  The last few times I have been disappointed with the take out.  This is a thin crust pizza that is best right out of the oven.  I can make it to my house in under 10 minutes and the pizza always loses almost all of the heat and isn't very good by the time I get home.  Since I know it loses the heat I arrive before my pizza is boxed so I am ready to roll asap.  The last pizza to-go was just blah, the onion chunks were as big as my pinkie finger. 3/4 of that pizza went out with the garbage.  I won't be returning here anymore.\n\nPrices for Toppings: I am annoyed with the price they charge ($2-4) for each topping and it's the same price for half.  You want onion on just half it will cost you $2.00...a whole organic onion doesn't even cost $2.00.  I am usually not picky about price if the food is worth it.  \n\nOur last dine in visit we were in the back room and the squeaky balloon animal guy drove us completely nuts.  If we wanted a Circus Style Pizza Experience w/ kids climbing all over the place we would go to Chucky Cheese!  Can you say \""BONKERS?\""--We couldn't wait to get out of there!!\n\nThey have great iced tea and the salads are all super. A small salad is enough for 2 people but don't expect any Ranch.  They have a great patio for outdoor dining with heaters which is great. \n\nMy advice: Dine in for pizza and don't ever get it to go.  You will be disappointed with the to-go temp by the time you get home...even if it's right around the corner."
4,Joe is the best!  He is very passionate about massage and very educated.
2,"The salsa was okay. The fajitas, nothing to write home about. Overall, for a place that always has a long line....the food was not very good."
3,"I was very surprised to find good quality and/or healthy choices at an airport. They offer a wide variety of foods from sandwiches to burgers to pizza. I had the Stacked Turkey Sandwich and I was shocked it was very good and it came with a lot of meat. Included with the sandwich were pickles and fruit. The prices are very reasonable, especially for an airport location. One gripe I have with the place is the order pickup. I can't entirely blame the workers because there are just so many people, both patient and impatient, ordering food. The workers are completely lost on orders and can't keep up calling the order numbers. If you can look past the questionable pickup, I definitely recommend this place if you have time and need food at the PHX airport (located at Terminal 4)."
4,Awesome meal. Started off with the fried pickles and chips and dip. Moved on to the gyros platter. Even better. Accented by a Coco Locos from Noda. Great service and food. Always coming back
1,"Hash House A Go Go has definitely developed quite the reputation for absolutely reBIGulous portions.  Had to experience this place for myself and boy, I was not dissapointed.  Although, this is where the praise ends...\n\n(1)  First tried to order their salmon dish for lunch... come to find out that they didn't have any salmon in?  Ummm.... so why's it on the menu exactly?  Dissapointment #1.\n(2) Quantity here does not equal quality.  Ordered the Bacon Bacon Bacon Lettuce and Tomato.  The sandwich was definitely big, but also very dry.  No mayonnaise whatsoever and they stack so much lettuce into sandwich that it dominates the bacon.  Additionally, the toast was way to big and I felt like I was eating Toast and Lettuce.  Not good at all. and for $11.95???? Definitely not worth it.\n(3) To top it all off, the wait staff took 10 minutes between giving us water and taking our order.  I saw 3 different tables get their orders in before our waitress even came back to us... that just made the wait that much longer.\n(4) Manager that day had no idea what he was serving. Sure it's nice enough that you come out and deliver the food to the table.  The order didn't look right and he was absolutely unsure of what he had in his hands when we questioned what it was... yeesh, study your menu yeah?\n\nThe only saving grace for this place was the Kiwi Watermelon drink.... would definitely come back here simply for that drink and one the most fresh tasting and refreshing drinks I've had in a long time.  \n\n1 star for the food.\n1 star for the staff.\n5 stars for the drink.\n= 2 stars overall.  \n\nSee the big portions once for yourself, then do yourself a favor and go elsewhere to find better tasting food."
0,Crap place that screwed up my rims on my brand new Jetta last year and would not take responsibility for it. Will not go back!
2,"Ordered takeout as this place is in the neighborhood.  Ordered house chow fun and the hot and sour soup.  The soup was AMAZING!!  Best I've ever had.  In the future I will go back and just have the soup.  It was full of flavor, and had shrimp in in.  I've never had hot and sour soup with shrimp, but let me say, I loved it!  The house chow fun was a different story . It had mostly chicken in it with mixed vegetables, but the chicken was rubbery and fatty.  Very gross!!!  The noodles were all clumped together and some of them were crunchy.  There was some sort of spice in the sauce that was very offputting as well.  If I had not ordered the soup, I'd never eat there again.  \nMaybe next time I'll try a shrimp dish, that's harder to mess up! \nThe portion was very large.  Enough to share with another person and have left overs!"
1,"This review isn't about Trader Joe's as an entire company, only this location. I love many of their private label items so I'm at this location at least once a week even though it's 8 miles from my house.\n\nWhat really bugs me about this store is that I see something in the dairy section that is out of code every single time I go there. Once I pointed out to an employee that some yogurt on the shelf had expired two days ago, and he reacted as if I insulted him personally.\n\nFor the cashiers, the customer service is about 50/50. There are a few unfriendly folks with a bit of attitude, but there are plently who go out of their way to strike up a conversation and are very helpful."
3,I like frozen yogurt and I like toppings.  I really like picking from a variety of both.  One can be healthy or indulgent! Cool flavors to select from and lots of topping to spoon on your frozen treat.  A fun place and it's frozen yogurt for Pete's sake...enjoy it! Oh get the punch card! Free yogurt after 8 visits!
1,"Oh Ncounter.  I was so excited. Why oh why was my food so cold and flavorless.\n\nI live within biking distance to Mill, so I was thrilled to see a new cool spot was opening up.  I was picturing cruising to Ncounter to grab a coffee and an omelet and going about my merry way.\nSadly, this fantasy will not come to fruition.\n\nUnderstandably, the place has only been open a week.  I know how hard it can be to work out the opening kinks, I've been in service for going on a hundred years now, so if I happen to go back, I'll be happy to reevaluate.  But honestly, this isn't the first restaurant you've opened...so why the subpar food???\n\nI can only speak about the food I tried, so here it goes:\nI ordered a latte and the Greek omelet.  I was pleasantly surprised by the latte.  I get soy milk, and often places somehow manage to make it taste like wood pulp, but here they got it right! Hooray, they passed the first test!  On to the omelet.  Yuck.  I don't know what the story was with this thing.  First off, cold. Secondly, raw white onions are just not my cup of tea.  I expected them to be sauteed and possibly seasoned.  But no.  Just raw, cold white onions.  Add cold artichokes, tomatoes, and a mere hint of feta cheese, and there you have the greek omelet.  I would have hoped for some sort of seasoning...I don't even think there was salt and pepper. :(\nMy boyfriend got the Ncounter omelet and an americano.  Unfortunately, his were both strikes.  The americano barely tasted like espresso.  I'm not quite sure if their barista knows what they're doing.  And his omelet? wow...the presentation itself was...well...gross.  Take a look at the accompanying pics...I think cottage cheese and hollandaise sauce should be put in cups...otherwise it looks like a big, multi-colored splat.  No, the taste wasn't there either.  The hollandaise was lackluster, and that was really all that you could taste.  Damn.  I love hollandaise, I was hoping for a really indulgent, amazing, gluttony inducing, goop.  But no again.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  You could tell the cashier's were sick of the same questions, but I know how that goes.  At least they were smiling through their frustration.\n\nI'd like to end this review by saying this: throughout writing this, I have decided to go back in a month or so.  I hope all the kinks are worked out, the cooks find their groove, and the barista gets the hang of it all.  I really would like my fantasy of a weekend brunch on the patio after a little bike ride to come true............    A five star review is in the works...I just feel it!!!"
0,Yuck food is greasy service stunk! I ordered a Philly sand which to find out they were out! Ordered French onion soup was way too salty. Mozzarella sticks ok but defiantly greasy! Waited 20 minutes for our check as we were told our server was busy. Needs a good cleaning also
0,"Great show (Allison Krauss and Union station) but the operators of the venue do not enforce non smoking rules in the seating area.Of course we sat in front of a Skank who was a chain smoker along with her male friend and had no respect for the people around them.They should not allow beer in the seating area either,as we spent half the show getting up and down to let the drunks come and go for beer.A night ruined by inconsiderate red necks."
1,"I tried to go to Giant today.  I live in Tempe but was running some errands in the area and had been wanting to check out Giant since there's so much buzz around the place.  After taking a couple turns to find parking I walked up to the register to be confronted with the \""Cash only\"" sign.  I asked if they were serious.  The barista said yes.  I asked if they'd take a check, since I randomly had my check book on me.  The barista said no.  And told me to go to CVS across the street to get cash out.  It's a hundred-flippin' degrees outside, so I'll take a pass on that.  I had no cash on me so I turned around and walked out.  I'm a small business owner myself, and get the outrageous fees charged by merchant services, but really?   Since I was in serious need of caffeine at this point I swung by Solo in Tempe on my way home where they gladly ran my Visa card.  I'll make sure to update this if I ever happen to be back in the area, can find parking, and have cash on me."
3,"Sick of dive bars that are just hipster code for dark and expensive with a dart board, well people need to take notice of Stage Door, which may very well be the crappiest bar I've ever had the privilege of drinking at. \n\nAnd I loved it. \n\nThe vibe makes you feel like you're drinking in the convenience store at a gas station, coupled with some losers wasting away at video poker at the bar. But that's ok, they can afford it considering how cheap this place is! \n\nVegas may be one giant rip off, but for at least the next 21 years, Stage Door will be there to make sure you can get full on drunk for cheaper than the price of one drink at the nearest casino bar. \n\nWell... maybe not quite... especially considering that this might be the first dive I've ever been to where my BOTTLED beer tastes watered down. \n\nBut really, at a place like this, I wouldn't have it any other way."
1,"The food's ok, but nothing we couldn't get in LA for less $. Likewise, the cocktails were good classics, but light on the liquor and heavy on the small-cubed ice. First time out, we sat in the restaurant, not the bar. We had the duck rillettes and the quail and waffles. The rillettes were pure heaven--so good that we came back for a farewell meal of them before leaving Vegas. The quail was a heavy, over-breaded gimmick. The waffles were bland. Totally not worth the $26\n\nThe service was...interesting. Interesting as in, I could write a thesis called Gender Dynamics in Las Vegas Cocktail Service on the experience. Our cocktail server on our second trip was friendly, but she made a point of serving my male companion everything first to the extent that when she accidentally set down my drink in front of him, instead of moving it over to me or allowing me to take it, she put it back on the tray, served my companion his drink, and then served me mine. \n \nNote to Cocktail Servers: The guest with the penis isn't always the one who picks up the tab. Treating all guests equally will probably land you better tips overall than will treating the ones with ladyparts like second class citizens."
2,If you're over fifty then this is the place for you.  If you're over sixty then you'll be in heaven.\n\nI was here tonight and enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and catching up with friends.  The circular bar is great and the front patio is pretty nice as well.
1,This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho
1,"Cheap, whole in the wall place.  Food was ok.  Not worth returning to.  It's good for all the businesses around that area in what appears to be food desert.  I just wouldn't go out of your way to go there.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean and the people were nice."
3,The sushi chefs are friendly and the staff is very attentive.  The tuna karai is fantastic!
4,"The staff was so friendly here! They were so nice to our kids, which is always appreciated! They had a lot of flavors to choose from and we especially enjoyed the zoatmeal cookie and fudge sorbet! Tons and tons of toppings to choose from, too. Glad we decided to try this place tonight and we will definitely be back!"
4,I found Ashley through a Groupon and I'm so happy I did. She was very professional and explained how each product worked as she applied it- which I really appreciated. Her studio was very clean and relaxing. I will definitely be coming back to Ashley for my future facials!
4,"Killer treats for your pup, lots of food, fresh and dry.\n\nThe man behind the counter was more than helpful and you could tell he was passionate about doggies.\n\nNot sure why these people are talking about grooming, I didn't see anywhere that a grooming service would exist in this tiny place."
3,"It's a good thing I don't live terribly close to this place or I would most likely be too large to fit in the door! Delicious cupcakes! I wish the frosting had more variety and there was more on the cupcake\n..but my fianc\u00e9 is the exact opposite,  he loveees the minimal icing to cupcake ratio. So if you are looking for a sweet treat without too much icing this is your place!"
4,"Wow!  An amazing experience.  The food was fresh, tasty and inventive.  The service was great!  Its like Japanese tapas, so it can add up fast, but its worth it.  They are open late.  This is where all of the chefs go when they finish work."
0,"When we were here last year, we didn't like this place much. The service was slow, we waited for the Dim Sum carts for 5-15 minutes. I had to push the cart to our table... boy, I didn't think they run that fast after me... since they were so slow with the cart. =P \n\nFood was ok, but I would recommend Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine instead."
0,"First time I ever visited this store I had to get a custom frame done for my boss. I ordered it November 17th 2012, the manager told me it would only take 1 week. I checked back on the frame 2 weeks later to see if it was ready because I had not received a call. The guy told me he would look into my order and give me a call back soon. December 23rd I call back and they tell me they don't have an order for me...I went into the store to show them the receipt for which I placed my order, but they told me that was a \""draft\"" of the order and it had not been paid for. I bring in the receipt AND my account statement to show them I had paid for the frame and the manager was unapologetic and didn't give me any discount or something to make up for their mistake. A week and a half later I FINALLY received my bosses frame . I don't think I will ever use Aaron's Brothers again because they charged me to expedite my frame when the manager honestly should have just expedited it for screwing up and they are so expensive. I was charged over $300 to create a simple silver frame..seriously?"
3,"I have been here several times in the, dare I say, several weeks, too hot to cook.  The food has always been very good and served in a decent time.  The first time I came in service was slow, but I have not seen that waiter since and have had no problems since.  I will continue going there, highly recommend it to anyone."
2,"Eyebrows R Us charges $10 to thread eyebrows. They are currently running a promotion where you can get a pack of 5 threadings for $35, and people that purchase this group deal are also given a coupon for a free eyebrow threading to give to a friend... One of my friends did this and gave me her freebie coupon so I could try them out after I told her I wasn't really impressed with the last place I went for threading. \n\nEyebrows R Us has multiple locations around Las Vegas. This particular one is located in a kiosk at Town Square. Since it is in a kiosk it's fairly small. I stopped in on my lunch break, right around noon on a weekday and there was no wait at all. The employees were very friendly and happy to explain both the benefits of threading to me, as well as the special package deal they have going.\n\nI thought the threading took slightly less time then the last place I went, which was one of the things I disliked about the last place I went. One thing I really don't like about threading is how every time I feel like some of the hair is in my eyes, irritating my contacts. \n\nOverall I think if you are a fan of threading you would probably be happy with Eyebrows R Us. Waxing is more my cup of tea, unless I get a special deal I doubt I'll be getting my brows threaded again anytime soon."
1,"My boyfriend and I went in tonight hoping to get some good happy hour drinks, some pub food, and watch the USA - Honduras match on one of their \""over 60 televisions.\"" The hostess said that the bar seating was open, so we sat at a high-top table and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited. \n\nThe place wasn't terribly busy, and several servers were waiting on the tables surrounding us, so to not even get an \""I'll be right with you\"" in 10 minutes was a little lame. After a while, the match was already starting (and not displayed on any of the TVs - we were going to ask if we could have one of them changed to the right channel) so we just went across the street and picked up some beer and sandwiches and went home to watch the match. \n\nI'm sure we'll try going again sometime, hopefully we'll actually get to eat there next time."
4,"I just took my 19 year old daughter to the Mystery Adventure  and we both loved it! \n\nFor the price, it is  the entertainment value of the year in Las Vegas. Lots of details, clues, puzzles, and gentle guidance when necessary... We were in a small group this tour (7 people) but we still managed to solve the crime and find 15 of the 18 bonus stones!\n\nHighly recommended and family friendly (over 10 yrs old)"
0,"I am a Vegas local and have stayed here on two previous occasions.  Both times were with Groupon/Living Social deals and I was very happy.\n\nFast forward to a month ago when I purchased another Groupon for a Spa package and hotel stay.  \n\nThe first time I called to book a date, I was told their reservation system was down and that a Supervisor would call me back the following day.  No call back.  I tried again a few days later and was told that they did not have the correct codes to book the Groupon.  I was also told a Supervisor would call me back.  No call back.  I again tried a few days later and was the told the same thing.  They did not have the correct Groupon codes to make a reservation?????   I was again told a Manager would be contacting me immediately.  A Manager did not call.\n\nMy next call was to Groupon.  I was immediately refunded my Groupon purchase and told that others had experienced problems as well.\n\nBuyer beware.  Not sure what is going on here.  A shame really considering it is a really nice Hotel."
0,"Horrible service given by a sales rep named Irene. We had the misfortune to have Irene assist us with our returns. We had an item out of the bag because we were debating on whether or not we wanted to return it. When telling her we wanted to return it she said that the item was not in the bag and she didn't take it out. At first I didn't understand what she was implying because I told her the item was on my receipt. She kept saying that she did not take it out of the bag. We told her we did to inspect it and she saw us do it! In the end she accepted the return which was probably  the smartest things she has ever done in her life.\n\nIf she could look up our history, she would see that we have spent over $500 in just the past 2 months alone. Why the hell would we try to 'steal' a $10 item. \n\nThis is the first hot topic I have ever been to where I left feeling offended and dissatisfied. San Diego hot topics are so wonderful! I hope this was a one off and not a vegas thing"
3,"Inspired by my Blue Photo, I thought it would be cool to catch a Blue Man Group show in Vegas. \n\nSeats for this show can be pricey. Fortunately, I was able to find a discounted seat online. You can try the code on the Yelp page, but I found a better one through Smarter Vegas. The ticket system used is Ticketmaster, but there did not appear to be a major surcharge from what I could see. If you get them online, you can pick up your ticket at the ticket counter next to the theater.\n\nBlue Man Group has two shows nightly at 7 pm and 10 pm. It lasts about 90 minutes or so. There was no intermission. I sat in row 2 of the poncho section. These are the seats closest to the stage. Everyone is given a poncho in this section as there is the potential for things like paint, regurgitated twinkies, etc. from the stage falling on the crowd. I was at the end of the row, so I had no issue with this.\n\nThe show is entertaining. It is an interesting mix of rock show plus comedy routine. The Blue Men don't speak at all during the performance, so the comedy comes from gestures and schticks. Kind of like a modern day version of The Three Stooges in mute.\n\nWhile the main attraction is the Blue Man Group, I like that they have random audience members participate in the show. It helps to engage the crowd in the performance even more. The ending took this to the next level. I won't spoil it for you, but I was totally not expecting what they did.\n\nThe Blue Man Group show is an inventive and entertaining show with excellent production values. It is worth seeing when in Vegas."
0,"I had such high hopes for this, seeing as Rick Moonen was on Top Chef Masters and has a great reputation.  Those hopes were quickly squashed once we arrived at the restaurants.\n\nWe had reservations on a Wednesday night, so I was not busy at all.  Once we were seated, it took approximately 20 minutes for one of our two servers to come take our drink order.  My husband ordered a cocktail, and I couldn't decide, so I just started with water.  It was another 15 minutes before he brought us our drinks, and he hadn't yet asked us if we wanted to order any starters.\n\nFinally he asked if we wanted to order anything, and we were interested in the cold platter.  It comes in three sizes, of which the small has 1/2 lobster, 6 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 3 mussles, and the house ceviche.  We asked the price, and it was ridiculously overpriced, even by Vegas standards.  We ended up ordering a dozen oysters instead, which were just ok.  He came back about 15 minutes later to see how they were, at which point I had to ask him if we could put in our dinner order.\n\nI had the Lobster Bolognese, my husband had the Cioppino.  Both were just ok, nothing special.  For the price on my Bolognese, I was expecting more lobster.  Odd thing with the Cioppino, the shrimp had almost the complete shell still on...only about 1/4 of each shrimp had been peeled.\n\nOur server never came by to ask how our meals were.  We had to flag him down to get the check, but you can bet the manager came by in about 30 seconds to run the card through.\n\nThis all seems good compared to the couple that sat next to us...after 40 minutes, they were brought another party's order.  Once they informed the server it wasn't what they had ordered, it was another 25 minutes before their food was brought to the table...and her shrimp was cold.\n\nRM Seafood needs to step it up...with so many other great dining options in Vegas (not to mention in Mandalay Bay), this will not be one I visit again."
2,The Camelback Copenhagen store is the only one I can recommend. The ones in Tempe and Scottsdale were extremely disappointing. The sales people at those stores ignored me the entire time and were too busy chatting among themselves. At least in the Camelback store the sales people offered assistance and were willing to explain some of the design features of the furniture. I will definitely shop again at the Camelback store.
2,"I visit this Costco twice a month, usually. 4 years ago, when we joined, I used to spend LOTS more $$ here than I do now. I feel the product quality since then has gone really down.(clothes, especially) and is actually very junky-looking. Not as good as it used to be. I think that's also due to the fact that when I go, I don't see it looking very organized or clean.\n  I 95% of the time go on Monday afternoons. Depending on when the newest coupons take effect or expire, the place can be CRAZY busy, or slow.The book selection has gotten worse over the past few years, and the latest redesign of the store lessens the amount they used to carry. BOOOOO! Guess i'll be using Sam's Club for more and more things now.\n\nYes, there are good to great deals to be had there, but not -all- the time. Yes, the $1.50 hotdog combo makes for a tasy and uuber-cheap lunch. Yes, the rotisserie chickens are great, but they seem smaller than before. Yes, the parking lot is one of the 7th layers of Dante's Hell. Yes, contacts are a good buy here, and the glasses/frames are actually quite great! Yes, gas is another good buy here, but a small tip: PURCHASE A GIFT-CARD inside the store, for say...$30. Use that for your gas purchases, instead of your credit card or debit card. Costco (Sam's club, too)  is notorious for holding $$$ on your card, ASIDE from the actual charges for your gas. Once, it was $300 for me! I learned this trick about the gift card, and life's been good ever since.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with Costco. BTW: Old Pennsylvania Dutch eggnog they sell at the holidays is AWESOME and so chock full of booze, you'll be knocked over when you open the bottle. BEST BUY EVER."
0,After coming to this place for almost a year bringing friends and family to try what I discovered to be the best ph\u014d Las Vegas had to offer! I was very disappointed to find that there portion sizes have been cut down. #31 white chicken breast lacked the quality egg noodle I substituted for rice noodle the broth was much more oily then before and what happened to the chicken??? Fresh spring rolls lost there fat and full zest and the service seems to have no care there guest get thirsty. I much prefer this place over any other ph\u014d restaurant as I would drive 30 minutes just to eat at this place. I have tested this place out numerous times before writing this review and sad to say this place has no longer captured my bu$ine$$
4,"This was the last show I saw when visiting Vegas.  I thought it was absolutely fantastic and a must see, especially for Beatles fans.  I got a great deal and got great seats (2nd row!).  That close you can see the performers running by doing their thing it was incredible.  The changing stage was pretty cool and a lot of the aerial stuff was great.  Not overly acrobatic like other Cirque shows but still enjoyable.  I really thought it was cool you can buy drinks at the bar before going into the theater (with your drinks).  Got a margarita with a collector cup for like $15 or so."
4,"Pricey but liked their selection, mild flavor, and presentation...\nMy kind of Japanese restaurant in Vegas"
4,"Monday's are flight night ($10) with 80s music, feel free to dress 80s style!\n\nI love what the owners have done with the space, it's romantic if you want it to be and great for groups with a separate space if you need it.\n\nThe servers are fun and friendly,  they know their wine.  The food is fantastic and it's great that they have gluten free options available.\n\nLive music on the weekends, feel free to dance if the mood strikes you.\n\nHighly recommend MWC Bistro"
4,Great food even better service!
4,"I've seen this place on my way to Costco and always wanted to try it. After my amazing facial at Kohler Academy I decided to stop in solo for lunch. It was about 12:30 and the place was pretty crowded. I ordered an ice tea and decided to go for the buffet. Everything looked and smelled delightful so I followed the other diners down the line-o-goodness.\n\n OMG i LOVE this place! From the tomato soup that I started with I knew I was in for a good ride. I pulled a piece of naan into pieces and dropped in into the soup while it cooled off a bit and then dug in and really didnt want it to end! I'm not even that crazy about tomato soup, but this was tops!\n\nNext I got some rice and ladled some chicken curry and chick tikka masala over it. Then I went straight for the palek paneer (?) spinich stuff. After adding mint, tamarind and yogurt sauce on the side, my plate was full. Back at the table I dug in and was so damn happy with everything I couldn't help but smile (love that feeling!!). Both chicken dishes were so tender and flavorful and the spinach was so good that after the first bite I knew I was gonna get more. \n\nRound two I decided to try the veggies. I got more spinach (natch) and also the peas with homemade cheese ( thats what it said on the sign, I dont remember the Indian name) and the chana masala-a garbanzo bean dish. Holy Buddha it was all so incredible that I wished I had someone there to gush to. I could barely finish everything from being so stuffed, but somehow I managed. I guessed to myself how much the check would be- 19, 20 bucks maybe? Try $12.85!!!!!!! I can't wait to bring my bf back here! This is one of my new fav's!!"
3,"I would say this is better than Thai Basil.... but then, I've only ever had mediocre experiences at Thai Basil.  It is not as hot as Thai Lhana (or is it Thai Lhana), but you will still feel it the next day.  I split the Fried Sweet potato, Tom Yum soup, some spicy red curried something, and some spicy something else with tofu with three friends.  Everything was good... although I was less satisfied with the fish caked fried sweet potato things.  They were a litle bland and the sauce wasn't super.  This place lends a lot of support to my \""treasure hunt\"" hypothesis for the metro region:  You just never know what might be in that strip mall next to the check cashing place and the Subway."
4,I love Rudy's. I work nearby and take my referral partners here often for lunch and have never heard anything but raving reviews. The moist brisket is the best!
4,"Well, for only being open a week or so (as of 1/21/14) this place is fantastic.  I've been back several times to try different items, and everything has been fresh and delicious.  There are some classics with a twist, and some out-of-the-ballpark hits.  At breakfast, so far my favorite is the Southern Fried Biscuits and Gravy.  It's a homemade biscuit that's crispy on the outside (because the sauteed it in butter--I asked) and fluffy on the inside with sausage gravy topped with fried chicken (yes, fried chicken) and two eggs.   My favorite at dinner is probably the chicken pot pie . . . unique with a cornbread crust.  Mmmmm.  I think my over-the-top favorite right now is probably the Rattlesnake Bites.  They are cream cheese stuffed jalapenos rolled in bacon and corn flakes (I think) and deep fried.  The ones I had ranged from mildly tingly to pretty zingy, so if you're super sensitive to spicy foods, better stick with the Fried Mac & Cheese, which was also very good.  Looking forward to going back soon.  I just found a new favorite place to eat."
1,Meh. I've experienced better.  (default for 2 stars)\n\nPretty much summed it up for me. \n\nDidn't notice any dank smell as Korinna suggested.\n\nMaybe because I went for lunch...don't know.
3,"Kung Pow chicken with peanuts was amazing.  Good for the after effects of some late night drinking. Service fast. Not too friendly, but hey, what do you expect for rapid service?  Quick easy and very tasty."
0,they're overly charged for delivery even when ur really close to the restaurant...
1,Ok food the waiter described the restaurant as tapas style but his was just really small portions and really overpriced. Not really fusion just sold both Mexican and Chinese food.  Their chinese street sandwich was delicious but it was tiny and would not pay $9 for that. Overall the dom dom mian was ok the sweet and sour soup was not good.
1,"I was so excited to try this place. In fact, I showed up two days early hoping to try their burgers. Worth the wait? Ummm, No!\n\nI ordered their bacon/avocado cheeseburger with their thousand island dressing on the side. I wasn't sure if I would like avocado with thousand island. Turns out-I didn't. \n\nThe burger showed up pretty quickly with no bacon or avocado on it. Since I paid for the extra items, I let them know what the problem was. The manager then comes to our table to make sure we were not hiding the bacon or avocado anywhere. Awkward!\n\nHe takes my burger back, and 30 seconds later bacon and avocado show up on my burger. I did like the bun they used-it was soft and had no sesame seeds. On the other hand, my wife ordered the standard cheeseburger with pickles and mustard only. Sesame seeds showed up on that burger? I am not sure why the difference. ..\n\nThe fries were ok-- although s little under seasoned for my liking. The onion rings tasted like leather with coating thicker than my ex-wifes makeup. No bueno!\n\nPrices were OK , and the place was clean. One bonus was that they offer Pepsi instead of Coke!  Yay! \n\nStill not coming back though......."
0,This place in ubelievable.! I originally brought my car in and inquired about some repairs while the recall was being fixed. Well Mr Ryan Wolfe jumped all over my extended warranty and opened a claim because i ASKED how much it cost. I declined the service and left. Well i went in a little later to get the repairs done because after i picked it up i had a crazy sound coming from my car that wasnt there before! and he tried charging me two deductibles because he never closed the first claim. I personally felt so disgusted because he did nothing to help except play the part of a good guy and blame it all on my warranty. He cashed in on my warranty and didnt even fix the problem THEY CREATED in the first place.  And i oh so convienently havent recieved a survey! Psh dont waste your time or money here. Theyre ridiculous.
2,"The price is good and there's a good variety of places to eat right in the hotel. Staff was also nice.\n\nI knocked 2 stars down though because whenever we (fianc\u00e9 and I) tried to go to the elevators to get to our hotel room we would constantly get harassed by people/workers standing in front of the elevators. They were very aggressive promising free shows, dinners etc., and they wouldn't take \""not interested,\"" for an answer. This happened almost every time we had to go to our room. It started to get extremely irritating. Here's a tip, when they ask, \""how long are you in town?\"" Just say you're leaving in a few hours. That's the only way we were able to get them to leave us alone."
4,Beautiful place and my nails/eyebrows have never looked so good. It's a little expensive though.
4,Best service ever and best food ever! Delicious pizza and appetizer! Best vodka ever and locally owned! Bam bam we love Carlos! Will go back.
3,"Disclaimer:  This review is based on notion's soft opening.\n\nThank the blogosphere that I caught wind that notion was having a donation only soft launch.  I decided to surprise the fiancee and whisk her over to East Liberty one day after work for what I hoped would be a unique experience...  notion definitely didn't disappoint.\n\nEliminating any inconsistencies from the rating (can't really ding a new restaurant on that), our server did a great job explaining the four course meal with wine pairings plus the bonus two complements of the chef.  Every plate was well artistic, well presented, and complex yet refined relative to the ingredients, which are the true star of the show here.  Notion ever so slightly transforms their ingredients to meld into something that overall satisfies the palate.\n\nAlas, that is also what prevents me from giving notion a 5-star review.  Although ALL of the dishes were pleasant to eat and I would order again, NONE of them managed to blow my socks off nor leave me craving for more.  At the end of the day, we donated an amount close to what the meal would of cost anyways (we thought it was worth it), but I wouldn't find myself ever proactively seeking notion out again."
1,"I hired Mauri to landscape my backyard.  While everything looked nice when they finished, there were serious functional flaws with their work.  \n\n1. They failed to maintain the proper slope for drainage, so at times of heavy rain, the backyard flooded.  When called back to look at it, they did not offer a solution.  We had to fix it ourselves.\n2. When they installed the pond / waterfall, they placed the filter system right up against a young palm and buried the hoses and accessories right around it.  As the palm grew, the roots broke the filter and made it impossible to dig up the hoses and accessories.  I am currently paying someone $500 to fix this snafu.\n3. Part of the job included running electrical to a hot tub, which they subcontracted out.  The electrical was not done to code and they actually attached the breaker box to the side of the hot tub, below the water level.  Of course, if it ever overflows, the water runs right down to the breaker box.  No experienced electrician would ever do this."
3,"Great place for outdoor pickleball. Tennis courts have recently been remodeled as well as other aspects of the park. Swimming pool, outdoor basketball and volleyball (sand & hard court) are also available. Kind of a hood section of town, but haven't had any problems to date."
2,"Full review in the blog.  This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\n\nseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\n\n\""Shrimp and Grits,\"" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\n\n\""Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\"" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\n\nFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \""Foie Gras\"" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\n\nBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\n\n\""Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\"" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \""fried rice\"" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \""kick ass\"" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\n\nMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\n\nButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\n\nUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \""Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\"" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\n\nIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\n\nOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and d\u00e9cor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio."
1,"I did not have the same experience others that rave about Dylan's here did, apparently. But, I did get the world's fastest men's cut (think super cuts). And to add to the oddness of my take on this place, it was the owner that did the cut! Unbelievable.  Too short. Too short. Too short.  I asked for a jagged cut. I got a straight boiler plate precision cut instead.  And did I mention too short?  Oh we'll, hair grows back, right?"
3,"Came to the bar and ordered a \""likiliki\"" drink - super fruity cocktail in one of those big long cups! \n\nWe are in Vegas, minus well enjoy it and party like a rockstar! Party like a rockstar! ;)"
1,"Well, by most off-the street burger places, even those who tend to be as pretentious as this place, this effort falls flat - but the experiences did have potential.\n\nOne night with a client I had the Really Good Burger cooked MED with an order of fries. I mentioned to the waitress the birger was overcooked and that the fries were limp and cold, she brought me another burger - bloody rare, not MED -.  I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chips after seeing the fries. The replacement chips were way overseasoned. They were so salty they burned my taste buds. If it were not for the draft Stella...\n\nTwo nights later I was on the receiving end of a dinner out by one of my vendors. They wanted to go to B&B. Being a gracious guest, I kept quiet thinking I could just find something else to order than a burger or a fried potato side.\n\nI ordered Crispy Cod sandwich and a lettuce wedge. The fish was greasey but it was hot, another 30 seconds of draining in the basket would have made it much better than bleeding the oil on the bottom of the sandwiches tarter sauce covered base. Again, it was OK, but for the price I would of expected something ... more. \n\nIf everything was executed and served correctly, I could easily give B@B Burger and Beer 3 to 3.5 stars. However, after two attempts in a week I'm crossing this place off of my list of Vegas places to eat, at any price."
3,This place was right next door to the school we had a basketball tournament at so I though I should just check it out. It was an interesting concept having Korean infused Mexican food. I decided to play it safe and got the kimchee fried rice. It was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried my friends cheesesteak and that was pretty bomb. I'd be open to coming back to eat here again and probably be a little bit more adventurous. \n\nThe key negative here is the slow service and the fact that they take forever to bring your bill and pick up your check. Was about to give it a three but I guess I'm just in a good mood right now.
2,"Got their jerk chicken and montagu (yes, that's two sandwiches) and they just tasted so so. There wasn't as much flavor in terms of spices but they were very much salty. Maybe my salt receptors were just hyperactive that day but the salt intensity was unbearable... Would try another sandwich in the future, maybe the original cause that's what my friend had and he enjoyed it. Nevertheless, the sandwiches are cheap and it gets the job done considering that it is Vegas."
2,There is one good thing about this Walmart which is why I give 3 stars. The people watching here is top notch!!!!
0,"Don't waste your time! So many good restaurants in Las Vegas and this is NOT one of them. Service was slow and the food looked good on the menu but tasted seriously bland. The portions were very small, like a child's plate.  Our party of 6 were all disappointed.  Sad, because we were trying to celebrate a birthday and this restaurant didn't deliver :(  If I knew how to give a minus rating I would..."
4,"I'm a QT fan anyway, but this one is one of the best. So many options to eat and drink. If you want junk food and sugary sodas, this is your place. If you want healthy options and herbal teas, this is your place. And, the icing on the cake is very clean, multiple-stall restrooms. Best place to stop for gas, snacks (or a meal), and a restroom break on your I-10 trip."
4,This is hands down my favorite place to grab a beer and burger! The atmosphere is perfect and the music can't get any better. Their burgers are huge and amazing and food/drink prices are on par. \n\nFYI their porkster is the best damn burger!
1,"I will start off by saying that I love Target - I hate THIS Target. The staff here is so unfriendly, things are way overpriced and the patrons are pushing their carts around like they are in a shopping race -- slow it down folks! I (never thought I'd say this in my life) but I really prefer to go to the Walmart across the way. It's clean, clerks are friendly, prices are competitive and the vibe is more positive. I will be avoiding this Target like the plague....sad sad day."
2,"Unless you come here for Happy Hour I'd say this place is over priced.\nMy friends and I used to come here for reverse Happy Hour on the regular for drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately, corporate did away with it. Which i think was probably a pretty horrible business choice considering there are a million other places to go to on Mill, which is exactly what we did when we found this out."
2,"Drove in with the kiddos and the Mr. from a couple days at Dizzyland to visit family and arrived at 10pm.  Valet and the bellman weren't busy and were very quick to help.\n A bit of an older hotel  with no real lobby except for the couple of couches right next to the slots.  Holy smokes does their ventilation system need updating.  It wasn't as bad as those horrible hotel/casinos in Reno but please consider upgrading/updating your ventilation.\nThe man at the front desk to the Mr. they oversold on rooms (on a MONDAY!?!) and we were upgraded to their 2 bedroom suites.  At $35/night rate upgraded to a $400/night suite?!? That alone earned them 3 stars.  \nI hate the hotels where the elevators to the rooms are 5 miles from the Front desk.  Fortunately The Orleans elevators were just down a bit from the front desk.  You'll pass a Rocky Mountain candy shop (Chocolate Caramel Apple!!) as well as their gift shop on the way.  There is security at the elevators and you have to show them your key card to gain access to the elevators, though I'm thinking it's more for show than anything else.  Most of the time the security were talking to other security or not paying attention at all.  \nTo gain access to the top floor you need your room key.  The 2 bedroom suite was nice and big.  You enter and you are in a living room/dining room/wet bar area.  On either side of that room is a bed room.  One had a Cal King, the other has 2 queens (each with its own bathroom).  Each room had 1 large flat screen and another small flat screen, 1 on the bathroom countertop and in the living room above the wet bar.  \n\nThe NOT SO GOOD:\n-The bathroom... ugghhhh... how I wish I had taken a picture.  The light above the tub had dead bugs in it and no I'm not talking about 1 or 2 bugs I'm talking about half of the light fixture being covered in really really BIG dead moths  and the first night at least 2 big bugs crawling around inside.  The next morning they must have died or escaped because there was no movement at all.  In the other bathroom there were less bugs which was good 'cause my little person (AKA kid) was freaking out about those darn creepy bugs.  \n-Some of the molding was rotting and the shower glass doors seems like they were going to fall off if you open them just right.  \n-You had to pay for WIFI (boo).  \n\nBUT you couldn't hear any noise from the hallway and the room itself didn't smell like an ashtray AND the carpet didn't turn your socks black or even gray for that matter.  This alone gave them another star as dirty carpets gross me out and will make me never return to your establishment again (though I had to take their 4th star away as those bugs are still giving me the me the heebee jeebeeies). \n\nThey left a notice under our door saying they were shutting the water off in the hotel for 4 hours (1am-5am) for maintenance.  They were also getting their windows washed and had a notice in the room as well.  \n\nGetting our car from Valet was a bit of a pain.  There were at least 4 valet guys just standing around talking to one another while people were waiting for their cars.  There were at least 5 other people/families needing there cars and only 1 real guy who was hustling back and forth.  \n \nwe did play in the arcades to satisfy the little people's craving for some fun.  Games ranged from 1 token up to 8 tokens and my little man, after an hour and $20, walked away with a bow and arrow, couple tiny plastic dinosaurs and a deck of cards.  We didn't partake in the bowling or movies but it was nice knowing those things were there to entertain the little people should they had decided to start driving us nuts.  Luckily we have good kids! ;)  \n\nI'd return BUT if they upgraded me to a suite again I'd make sure the bathroom was bug free."
4,"Totally legit.  Panko crusted chicken strips perfectly cookied and seasoned.  Didn't get anything except the fried strips - not sure why'd you go baked or grilled. Eff that - go with the tastiest option.\n\nMac and cheese was decent as well.  Looking forward to trying their rice bowls, nachos, and korean dish who's spelling I don't want to butcher.  Owner is nice and friendly - though I personally didn't feel like talking that day so he probably thought I was rude.  \n\nCheck it out!  Delicious."
2,"You can't really mess up pho.  It's nothing but meat, veggies, and broth.  Then as a customer you add as much lime, sprouts, cilantro, hoisin, and sriracha you want. \n\nWell Pho Little Saigon pho was neither special nor terrible but it satisfied my pho craving when I needed it, more better than bad. With maybe 2 or 3 other pho places already in the area, less then 1/2 mile a part, it does have pro's over the others. They seemed pretty clean back when ate here a few months ago but I believe they were recently on Dirty Dining. Honestly I'll probably eat there again if the party wants to eat here. Why? Because they have a good variety of items on their menu besides pho, it didn't make me sick, priced inexpensive, spacious interior with plenty of tables, and they'll probably get it corrected.  The only thing I didn't like was that they'll keep to the credit card minimum thing.\n\nLocated right off the 215 and S. Eastern near Chuck E Cheese."
3,"This review is for their open mic nights on Mondays. Every Monday they have an open mic night starting at 7:30. It is lottery based so you'll line up to pick a number and play based on the number you get. Depending on the number of people performing that night and the number you get, you could play anytime between 8pm and close. I came here to perform for my first time ever in front of a crowd and couldn't be happier with how it turned out. When I first got there, I had really bad jitters but after the first or two performance, I could really tell that there was a lot of support in the crowd. It's a great community with a lot of regulars and everyone there is really supportive. I highly recommend this place for first timers."
2,"Had bbq pork sandwich.  It was good, but over priced. No lids for your soda? Wth? Wish they served fries instead of potato chips."
1,Was like any other typical bbq place. Unsure why there was so much hype. Service was slow. Food was tepid.
0,Do not move here!!! They are lying to you there are no  amenities here no security . All the machines in the gym have problems.  The second floor in the gym is covered  in plastic it's been over three months!!! Don't believe any thing they say here. you can keep taking\n\n my review down  but remember I live here and I know what goes on here so I will now check it everyday
1,"I ordered the shrimp Burrito, What I received was some of the worst tasting shrimp in my life.  It tasted as though it was microwaved it was so rubbery and tough!  Seriously buyer beware!   Really bad!  Service is still good and efficient but the Shrimp really was horrible!"
3,"I've never had an Arepa before so I have nothing to compare it to. I think I'd classify it as tasty and quick street food. The shredded beef was well seasoned and the Spanish cheese reminded me of cheese I had in Nicaragua. It was topped with a spicy and quite tasty avocado sauce.\n\nIts all stuffed into a grilled bread that was both fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The guy cooking was very nice and happy to explain what everything was, I'd definitely suggest dropping by here if you want a late night snack, plus right down the street were some break dancers who apparently are there pretty often. So you can eat your Arepa and watch some cool dancing."
2,"Being this my first time I'll give it 3 stars. I will go a couple more times and then I can really give it a review but for my first experience it was ok.\nI got the vegetarian spring rolls and the chicken pho, both were good. Nice flavor and fast service. \nThe booba tea was good too.\nThe only bad thing that I saw was the people who were sitting across from me were trying to kill a roach that was on the blinds! I'm sure they were loyal regulars or something because they didn't make a scene or said anything."
2,"Shopping for a jock strap in a former Albertson's seemed weird, but I stopped here first anyways during my latest hunt for some gym and hiking/camping gear. It's new and it's really the only major sporting good store in Central Phoenix.\n\nA quick walk inside reveals an average looking sporting good store and unless you knew it, you wouldn't be able to tell the bakery was once where the treadmills are. \n\nIt was kinda quiet the other night, but several staff (maybe 5 people) passed by several times without saying a word.  And it took a while, but I finally found some Adidas & Puma shorts on sale and some athletic socks.   They were out of the hiking gear, and after I went up to ask someone I found out that they were cleaned out after Christmas.\n\nI'll probably go back since it's conveniently located, but it's nothing I would drive out of my way for.  Three stars."
4,"If someone would prepare vegetarian meals like this for me every day, I would never eat meat again! I ordered the falafel appetizer, classic burger and we all split a bottle of wine. Everything was delicious, the burger was a \""real\"" burger portion size and I chose the beet salad side. My friends ordered the living bagel (amazing) and faux tuna sandwich (wonderful.) Such delicious little place!"
4,"The spinach salad was to die for. I never had white Truffle bean puree in this appetizer of Olive tapenade. It was delicious. I love the decor,too. I went to Las Vegas with some girlfriends but the highlight of my trip was eating at this place two days in a row!! The wait staff Edward and Pedro were outstanding."
2,"PROS: \n- Outdoor seating with great view\n- Great selection of Scotch/Whiskey (Lagavulin 16)\n- Gorgeous waitresses (Seriously, I fell in love)\n\nCONS:\n- Very pricey\n- They don't take American Express \n- Ok selection of Cuban cigars\n- The cigar I had had some white spots on it, seems like they need to get the humidor temperature corrected.\n\nWould I go back? Yes"
0,I was unable to get ahold of them on a prepaid voucher. What a tragic example of the American small business! Shame on you Maid Affordable for having such poor business practices!!
1,The food isnt hot. How can they prevent bacteria from growing. T he inside smelled terrible
2,"If you want to live it up like you're a Real Housewife of Beverly Hills...but you live in Scottsdale...Arizona, then this is the place to be!  There's a Gucci, Nieman Marcus, and even a Barney's all under one roof.  Don't forget -- the more you spend, the more fabulous you are!!!\n\nWant to feel extra fancy/important...Valet your car!\n\nWho cares that there's ample structure parking that's just as close.  Self parking at the mall is for poor people!!!"
0,"We decided to eat here before a movie since it was close.  They were still only serving champagne brunch.  For a buffet, I definitely expected more.  There was not much of a selection.  The food was bland.  It was not worth what we paid.  We were very disappointed."
4,I have come here with my husband multiple times for lunch and it is always good. The staff is friendly and food is made quickly and is always delicious! They give a 10% off Red Ventures discount if you work there!
3,Love this place. For a fat guy they put all the xxl shirts on one rack in the store. easy shopping for fat guy like me who do want to walk all over the store.
4,"I've been several times now, and more impressed each time. Great service-- sometimes TOO often coming by to ask how their new \""amigo\"" is...but that's a small issue. Great food, with good variety on the menu. LOTS of it too. By far my favorite Mexican in this area."
2,"Came here twice during my stay at the M Resort. \n\nToo full from the day to eat dinner, so my mom, aunt and I opted for some gelato. I had pistachio gelato in a waffle cone. It hit the spot, but I definitely have had better gelato elsewhere. \n\nThe next morning, we were still full (LOL!) so we went back there for some pastries. I had the raspberry danish. It was a cheese danish with FRESH raspberries on top. SO GOOD. The only thing was that the pastry part of it wasn't fresh. It was a day old, I could tell. \n\nMy mom had a blueberry scone, and my aunt had a pumpkin scone. They liked them but they also didn't taste freshly made. So, that's where they lost a couple stars. It's a BAKERY. And we went first thing in the MORNING! It should be fresh, no? At least taste fresh...\n\nWe also got a bowl of \""fresh fruit\"" which consisted of like 4 berries and a bunch of honeydew melon. Meh, it was healthy. \n\nI would come back if I was staying at the M. But I wouldn't go out of my way to get there. I do wish I tried one of their cupcakes though. It may have earned them back a star!"
2,Not your usual pizzas (the specialty ones). I like the Mediterranean one and the fava beans one (my favorite). The eggplant one was always very heavy though.
0,"Huge nightmare.  One of the worst spots on UW-Madison's campus and really all of downtown.  Sure there could be tons of young talent on any given night but take my word for it, this place is a total bust more often than not.  It's basically a frat house.  Bar food definitely isn't winning any awards either, but at least it's something to throw in your mouth.  If you have to go there just drink and do it fast.  Proceed with caution."
2,"Eating out with a toddler can be a real pain.  Take the sting out of spending over $6 on a kid's meal that your kid wont even eat and bring them to \""The Pizza Buffet, and Much, Much More.\""   They are sure to find something they will love here.  Kids eat free on Monday and Tuesday with a paid adult buffet and beverage!\n\nI entered the restaurant with my almost two year old just before noon.  I was greeted by a cashier that was friendly and helpful.  Before we even hit the buffet line she offered to make us a our own custom pizza.  A custom pizza, for little ole me, moi?  It was a great way to start the meal.  While I waited for our custom pizza to bake we grabbed a plate and worked our way down the line.  At first, I was pretty disappointed.  There were 10 partial pizzas.  All of them looked like they had been sitting there since they opened the restaurant an hour before we arrived.  We grabbed a slice and continued to the \""Much, much, more\"" section.  We passed on the mashed potatoes and gravy, they looked crusty.  The rice was delicious, the fried chicken was tasty, albeit a tad dry.  There was also barbecue chicken, but we didn't try it.  The salad bar had plenty of fresh veggies to offer and this is where my toddler did the most damage.  \n\nAs we sat down to enjoy our food and the first fresh pizza landed on the line.  Then another.  And another.  It was great!   When we returned to the buffet it was filled with piping hot pizzas...lots of them.  We threw down on a few slices and lots more cucumbers, then hit the road.  For a grand total of $7 and some change we were both stuffed silly."
2,"Its is your typical Pizza Hut pizza. This location is a carry out/delivery only. The carry out deals are great, amd since this is close to home, we take advantage of those. I found that the delivery drivers havr no personality; they have forgotten to deliver things I've ordered like soda or my side of bread sticks, amd I never get my ranch or blue cheese when they deliver wings. Overall..wings are good, pizza is typical,  and they have good deals."
1,"Not very good. Went for lunch and didnt really like any of the food too much. Tried seafood, chinese, salads, breads. Chicken Kiev was ok. Desserts were of a higher quality than the food, not too bad. Service was weak even for a buffet. Unpleasant staff sat us and cleared trays."
3,I do love this pizza. Best I've had outside of New York. Hardest part is just not eating too much. Only wish the tables were a bit bigger to give more room for everything- just seems the inside tables suffer from being too small.
4,"I needed to rent a pick up truck to move some furniture quickly.  The online process to reserve the truck was great...but what was even better was the EXCELLENT customer service I received. From checking in, to receiving the truck to turning it back in!  I want to thank the guys there today 10/1/14 at 4pm  YOU all ROCKED!  Thank you for making this old gal feel okay about driving a truck!"
0,"Never made it inside Wet Willie's. The guy at the front door would not let us in because we had hats on. Yep, hats. LAME! My brother had a baseball cap & my buddy had a fedora on. Are they trying to be \""upscale\""? This is Wet Willie's right? By the looks of the insides, you were in need of patrons. We walked right across the hall to Saloon and were welcomed right in, hats and all. Sorry Willie, we won't be back! I'm sure the frozen concoctions are good, but it's the principal."
2,"When I first started going to Vegas, one of my favorite activities was the simulation ride they offered at the Luxor.  I don't know how many times I was in search of the obelisk.  Kind of cool.  Kind of hokey now, compared to the entertainment offered nowadays.  \n\nMy husband and I stayed here once, and aside from the cool ride up the elevator, there really wasn't anything special.  The rooms in the pyramid are basically cut short by the slant of the window.  All in all, it was a non-memorable stay.  It's very dark in the casino.  While I love my time at the slots, I dovalue the option of just enjoying what the hotel I'm staying at has to offer - and there's not much here for me anymore."
1,"Something's clearly wrong with their AC system on the clothing side, which is pumping a horrid smell through half of the store. Items are on par with goodwills but I'd much rather go to goodwill"
0,Beware getting any deals you are offered as you are waiting in line at this car wash.. the guy that came up to my car.. said a great deal.. he would shampoo my carpets and seats and scotch guard them all while throwing in the works carwash all for $40.. a great deal he said... marked off the ticket and I signed it was ok .. noting the total at the bottom of the ticket said $40 bucks.. shoved it in my purse.. paid for it at the cashier.. but guess what.. he only marked carpet cleaning on the actual ticket.. for $24... so what was the other $16 for to make the total $40??  Not one other thing was marked and they did not do anything other than the carpets.. The works was noted for free so it wasn't the lousy car wash they gave me that cost the extra $16... this guy lied to my face and I made him sign off on a slip that they would do the seats for free but I after looking the receipt over I realize this is an dishonest scam being pulled..
4,I have been bringing my dogs to Dr. Brinkmann since my dog was blinded by another ophthalmologist here in town. Dr. B was able to save her eye from being removed  however her sight could not be restored because the damage caused by the first doctor(?) was too great. I take my dogs every 6 months to see him and his wonderful staff. Dr. B is the most experienced eye doctor for animals in Las Vegas and I recommend him highly.
0,"Update 23.11.2010\nNachdem ich bei VOX und den K\u00fcchenprofis einen Blick in die K\u00fcche werden durfte, werde ich auch nach den Verbesserungen NIE WIEDER einen Fu\u00df in diesen Laden setzen. Sch\u00f6n, dass dem Sternekoch Herrn Baudrexel die Pimientos auch nicht schmecken. Die von Vox dokumentierte \""Hygienekatastrophe\"" ist meiner Meinung nach eher eine Sache f\u00fcr das Gesundheitsamt als das Fernsehen. Mehr gibts hier: http://bit.ly/iick8O \n\n\n Ich pers\u00f6nlich werde diesen Laden erst wieder betreten, wenn der Inhaber gewechselt hat. Wer eine K\u00fcche so verdrecken l\u00e4sst und falsch ausgewiesene Produkte (Pimientos versus profane Pfefferschoten) verkauft, hat meiner Ansicht nach die falsche Einstellung zum Beruf.\n\n\n Update vom 22.08.10\nAuch dieses Erlebnis heute war einer der weniger erfolgreichen Abende. F\u00fcr mich ist der Laden ab sofort tabu. \nWas hat mich gest\u00f6rt?\n- Wir haben die Pimientos in zwei Variationen bestellt. Gekommen sind keine Pimientos (Wikipedia: Es handelt sich um die unreifen gr\u00fcnen Schoten einer bestimmten Paprikasorte der Art Capsicum annuum, in etwa von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines Jalape\u00f1o), sondern profane Pfefferschoten. Ich habe ein Bild davon gemacht. Fr\u00fcher hatte ich die mal und hatte auch das bestellte auf dem Teller. Diese Zeiten sind anscheinend vorbei\n- Raucher: Die stehen bei Regen auch mal gerne im Eingang (dann auch gleich zu dritt) und der ganze Qualm weht ins Lokal. Draussen gibt es riesige Schirme, unter die man sich zum Rauchen auch stellen kann. Den Service lie\u00df das kalt. \n- St\u00fchle und Tische draussen: Schlichtweg unbequem. Unseren Tisch haben wir nicht dazu bewegen k\u00f6nne, nicht zu wackeln. Die Streben unter den Tischen machen es mir mit 1.90m fast unm\u00f6glich gescheit daran zu sitzen\n- Apfelsaftschorle ist standardm\u00e4\u00dfig Lift, man bekommt aber alternativ eine richtige. Dann aber als 0,3l Wasser und 0,2l Apfelsaft. Eher eine d\u00fcnne Sache ...\n- Was soll denn die ganze Werbung in der Karte? Da werden unter fast jeder Seite lokale Gesch\u00e4fte beworben. Wer braucht denn so was?\n- In der Karte habe ich auch (was ich vorher nicht kannte) Pizza, Pasta und Flammkuchen entdeckt. Flammkuchen? Mexikanisch????\n. Ein Kompliment an unsere Bedienung. Das Essen hat zwar ewig gedauert, aber die Dame war sehr nett und sehr bem\u00fcht.\n\n\n Update vom 29.06.09:\nWar gestern Abend im Cubanita und habe Abgr\u00fcnde erlebt. Im Lokal waren gegen 23:00 Uhr ca. 20 Personen an 4 Tischen und ca. 5 Mann Besatzung hinter der Theke. Der Service war nicht in der Lage die Bestellungen den Tischen zuzuordnen (tats\u00e4chlich innerhalb 5min zweimal passiert) und die Bestellung hat ca. 15 Minuten (4 Ramazotti) ben\u00f6tigt. Zahlen ging dann gar nicht, da keiner zust\u00e4ndig war. Wir sind dann nach weiteren 20 Minuten an die Theke zum zahlen. Dieser Service war schlichtweg nicht gut. Habe auf Grund dieser Erfahrung zwei Sterne abgezogen und kann das Cubanita vorerst nicht mehr empfehlen.\n\n\n ____________________________\nDas Cubanita ist ein verl\u00e4sslicher Partner, wenn es um einen netten Abend geht.\n\n\n Das Essen ist einwandfrei und der Service fix zu Stelle.\n\n\n Ich bin ca. 3-4mal im Jahr dort und wurde bisher nicht entt\u00e4uscht.\n\n\n Empfehlenswert sind die Pimientos Verdes (schmeckt wie auf den Kanaren, auch wenn ich mir das letzte mal h\u00f6llisch die Zunge verbrannt habe) und die Fajitas (f\u00fcr mich Tobago).\n\n\n Uneingeschr\u00e4nkt zu empfehlen - auch das Ambiente passt."
0,"I spoke with them a couple of times about setting up a class for myself and my kids but then they dropped the ball and no one returned my calls. When I called back, to follow up, I was treated as if I had done something wrong, or had not followed up correctly. She asked several questions in an extremely frustrated tone--had I ever even used my machine before, was  it in working order, etc. Legitimate questions, but asked as I were an idiot. The woman then acted as if she couldn't hear me on the phone, when I tried to reschedule. I gave up, but I was so disappointed."
1,"I have been a Jamba juice customer for years! Recently I've been coming to this location because they do half off smoothies before 10am.  The owner has decided to flip-flop on this policy that has earned them my business.  I will not be coming back, I would much rather pay full price elsewhere!"
4,"I needed an ID photo for an overseas job and it was a nightmare trying to find a place to  get it taken. The requirements for the ID photo were specific and demanding: From the top of the head to the chin must be 22-28 mm, anything else is unacceptable. I went all around the valley to places like PostNet and Walgreens explaining to their Passport photo department about the ID photo I needed and they would get confused or they would pass it off -- 5 different times. I went home and did some research on other passport places around the valley and I found Burton Studios, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThis place was so pleasant. I explained what I needed and he understood without a hitch and before I knew it we were done. At PostNet I spent more time explaining the requirements of the photo in the time it took him to take the photo and get everything right. We even had a nice conversation while the photos were printing out. It was such a headache-free experience in comparison to the other 5 places I went to the weekend before. \n\nI highly recommend this place for photos. Going to places like PostNet and Walgreens made getting an ID photo a headache-inducing nightmare, but not only did Burton Studios handle my specific requirements with ease, they also made it a pleasant experience. I'll be sure to be back if I ever need their services."
1,"Food here was delicious, i would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Yes, service was that bad. And I believe Matt our server was the owner or manager. All of our table got the feeling that we were bothering him somehow, it wasn't even busy. He would run away as soon as he dropped off our drinks before we could even ask for cream for coffee, I stared at him for 20 minutes trying to get his attention before I retired and asked another server who looked much busier than him. Same story with our food, he HANDED us our food to pass around to whoever it belonged to and ran away as soon as his hands were free- wait ranch! Everything look ok? Nope, he was gone. And didn't return until he brought the check, joy. No eye contact, smile, or thanks for coming in. We will not be returning."
4,"I've been here once, and I plan on going back. My favorite sushi is plain tuna, and Sushiya had the best I've had in a while. As far as I'm concerned, it was perfect. The other stuff was quite good, also.\n\nThe dining room is small and not exactly romantic, but the food and service are great."
2,"This place has the most uncomfortable seats ever! It made it a little hard to enjoy my meal, but the food was good so I quickly got over that. The service was great and we even got a free show... Apparently the lady behind us threw a fit because they wouldn't let her take the \""all you can eat\"" home. Seriously, people suck! But the manager handled it with class and even walked over to us to see if we were ok... We will be back!"
2,"I have been wanting to eat at MAG rest ever since I drove by it back in the days, finally we decide to eat here for Valentine's weekend since we were in town. We are seated in the Pavilion which was really nice and fun (very romantic too), reminds me of Dubai restaurants. I ordered the french onion soup which I am dying to try; it was very good, but I honestly don't think it was the best I have had, maybe it was my cup, but there was really a lot of cheese, I mean do not get me wrong, I LOVE CHEESE, but there was almost more cheese than onion broth!!!! I swear I could feel my thighs expand with each spoon of cheesy soup!!! For lunch entree I had the Warm chicken & Bree sandwich which was OK!! nothing out of the ordinary. My husband ordered the cream of mushroom (i think thats the name) which was delicious. And for lunch he had the Quiche Lorraine which was really really really buttery. My husband is not a difficult man to please when it comes to food. He never leaves a plate with food on it.  Today was the first time seeing him barely touch his plate! I am not sure if it was the eggs or the butter or the crust being even triple buttered as well, it just was not good! You can say that I am a harsh critic, but my God my husband didn't finish it!!! I could not even swallow the bite I tried!!!! I had high hopes after reading all the yelp reviews! I wish it was better, maybe the steak would have been a safer order which was his original thought but poor thing he figured he would try something different!!! LOVE THE BREAD STICK though and the atmosphere."
1,"If only they spent as much time on their beer as the did their decor... Didn't really care for the atmosphere, way too many roaming dogs off leash.  Not a fan of the beer but hope they'll get it right with time."
4,Great neighborhood bar with great Pizza.  I usually get a large pizza to-go and I am always happy with it.  Good Ranch dressing and friendly employees.  Thumbs up.
2,"I've only been to Meatheads once and it was for a show. My friend's band was playing a show and I always take time out to go hit up bars to listen to their music. I'm a huge supporter of local music.\n\nMeatheads is a small, skinny bar. At the end is where they have their concerts and they have comedy nights (so I've heard, but have not seen). It's in a strange location, in a large Wal-Mart shopping complex, shoved in between a Jamba Juice and a Panda Express. Makes me wonder if the bar had been there for awhile and then those chains just popped up later...\n\nAnyway, it's a nice little neighborhood bar. The bartender was attentive for the most part. However - the fact that this place hosts bands is just so weird to me. The tiny space just does not make is very conducive. BUT I still had a good time and maybe being crammed into such a small place had a little bit of charm, like \""oh we're all getting in here to see this band and listen to the music and it's gonna be loud and in your face!\"".\n\nIt's a bit far away from where I live and I doubt I'd ever go back there just to have a drink and hang out. But if there was another band that was playing a show there I'd definitely go."
2,"Really liked my Apple, Bacon, and Cheese Panini. The service was good and friendly and the atmosphere is nice for a bar. It even has a dining focused upstairs area for those focusing more on food than drink. Also, good fries."
0,"My flight was 70 minutes long. My wait to get my internet reserved car was longer. I was 7th in line. There were 4 people at the counters. They spent so much time trying to up-sale the people in front of me that it took over 40 minutes to get a person through the process. Even when people kept saying they were not interested they kept pressuring them. It got to be a sarcastic joke among the people in line. What made the wait longer? People went on lunch during this time. I am pretty sure one person left to check her text messages (she pulled out her phone after finishing a customer...50 minutes after I got there, looked at it then left ....only to return in 10 minutes). When I got to the counter and complained about the wait the person told me (seriously) 'If time is important to you I would chose another company'. \n\nAs I finally left I looked at the other company counters...Avis had one customer and two people. That was the busiest competitor they had. \n\nAvoid at all costs!!! \n\nIf you made the mistake of reserving a car with them and can't change the key is be terse with them. If they try to pressure you to take something you have already refused don't even speak. Just look at them like their idiots until they get the point and give you what you reserved at the price your reserved it at. \n\nIt is possible to get through the process in less than 10 minutes if you do this."
2,"What to say about GSB? \n\nTheir food is really quite good. I imagine it's even better after a night out on the town. I happened to stop by for lunch one day. I work in the area and wanted to try something new. There are about a dozen bar stools and some counters you can sit at to dine in, but that's it.\n\nMy coworkers and I got an assortment of items, which were all bigger in portion size than we expected. The food is heavy-- the kind that makes you want to take a siesta-- but flavorful, made to order, and made with real ingredients. \n\nThe flauta is huge, and filling (I recommend beef)! The chicken quesadilla is delicious and also rather large. All the meat is flavorful and it seems to be shredded on site. The homemade chips are awesome! Truly delicious, if unhealthy, food. \n\nOne thing I've got to say that irks me though, is the decor. I know, I know, we're in a college town. The inside of this small restaurant is painted cardinal red and covered in UW memorabilia. Fine. The bathroom however... Yes, your name is \""Get Some Burritos\"", but do you really have to put suggestive quotes and euphemisms all over your walls? Aren't \""that's what she said\"" jokes a little pass\u00e9 at this point? Step up your game GSB. Class it up just a touch, and maybe someday I'll dine in instead of always getting food to go."
3,"I hadn't heard anything about this clothing store, but my friend wanted to stop in here after reading about it in her Montreal travel guide.  Luckily, my friend spoke French and could talk to the sales staff to find out some interesting tidbits about this shop.\n\nIt was a really trendy shop with some great designs that you would be hard pressed to find on the High Street.  Colours were vibrant and you would be sure to stand out wearing one of them.  All designers are Qu\u00e9becois which is a great way to support local designers and give them a place to shine.  Prices were a little high but on par for designer labels and there was a sale going on whilst we were there which made things a bit more affordable.\n\nMake sure you brush up on your French before you head in here or you might find yourself missing some great items."
2,All my neighbors love this place. Great eye candy. Regular bar food. Good selection in bottle beer. Very expensive beer selection. Occasionally have beer specials throughout the week. It's a great place for 40+ crowd. Eastfield Grill is great for the neighborhood of Highland Creek & Sky Brook area residents. It makes it convenient and don't need to deal with the headache of driving downtown. If you need a drink nearby than Eastfield Grill is the place.
4,"Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all.  Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon.  Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy.  Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces.  Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb.  Lamb was way tender, excellent choice.  Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere.  Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream.  Left happy and very full!"
0,I ran into an ex-waitress of this restaurant recently and I was told that the ownership indeed changed and that the new owners were clueless.  Hence most of the staff left (allegedly).  I also heard that this place has now gone out of business.  Anyone know if this true?
3,"Cet endroit \u00e0 tout pour plaire: un menu v\u00e9g\u00e9tarien plus qu'abordable disponible jusqu'\u00e0 la fermeture, de la boisson pas ch\u00e8re (les pintes de bi\u00e8res et de cidres \u00e0 4$ les lundis et mardis = joie!), un d\u00e9cor un peu boh\u00e8me, une salle de spectacle et une jolie terrasse.\n\nApr\u00e8s un spectacle donn\u00e9 par mes amis \u00e0 la Sala Rossa, tout \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9, on avait faim mais pas envie de McDo. C'est l\u00e0 que la Casa del Popolo est venu \u00e0 notre rescousse. Si vous h\u00e9sitez, allez y avec le sandwich au miel et ch\u00e8vre, il est vraiment d\u00e9licieux! Mais on passe pour les desserts, ils n'en valent pas tant la peine. C'est agr\u00e9able d'avoir un endroit o\u00f9 se nourrir sans remords jusqu'\u00e0 tard, et j'ai bien h\u00e2te d'y retourner durant la journ\u00e9e pour boire une bi\u00e8re tranquille en lisant sur leur terrasse!"
3,"Why not 5 stars? The location. I was a little creeped out by the location and the strange building next to it. There were some real sketchy lookin' dudes hanging out over there. Parking lot was kiiiinda small, but we found a spot.\n\nOther than location, it's great! I was craving Indian Fry Bread and Googled restaurants...this seemed like our best bet. I'm so glad we chose it. The fry bread taco was faaaaaantastic (exactly what I was craving), and the posole was AMAZING! I didn't really like the chocolate butter dessert frybread; I'd probably go with honey & powdered sugar next time. \n\nThe decorations were very nice. The customer service was...decent. There was a nice Indian lady outside (despite the sweltering heat) making and selling jewelry. It was nice to look at & if that's your style she had some good prices.\n\nI would definitely go back. However, I might bring a gun or pepper spray next time. Lol."
2,"the chicken noodle soup was delicious, it had noodles, veggies, chicken, and not overly salty.\n\nthe baked rigatoni took longer than expected to get. \n\nIf it was just a tad cheaper It would have gotten 4 stars."
0,"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! \n\nWe just went to the drive-thru at this Burger King and the girl (Ashley) was so rude. We started to place our order and immediately she cuts us off and doesn't listen. We had to pull up to the window to place the order. Once we got to the window, she huffed and puffed the whole time and threw us attitude. Our order was thrown into the bag, the burgers were spilled out of the wrappers and the onion rings weren't even full. Both orders were half empty. Once we got home, we called back and asked for a manager. Whoever answered the phone wouldn't tell us who they were and hung up on us. They then called us back to harass us and blame us for the hang up. \n\nI will never go back to this location. Calls have been put into the corporate office. Will update once we see what they are going to do."
4,"Overall:\nI was extremely happy with this place. Good service, very friendly even though they were very busy, but it was a Sunday afternoon so I can't blame them of course. The environment is absolutely beautiful, I love the little lake and ducks and the people in the restruant were all very lovely people. I will definetly be back to bring my other family members along. The food was very fresh (I had shrimp tacos) and it was very good. Two tacos made me full. Prices? I wouldn't say they are over-priced, for people saying they are over-priced, this is standard for Scottsdale, even though this is Cave Creek area, a lot of us from Scottsdale are very close. :)\nI forgot to add we had to wait 25 minutes for our table, but they did warn us ahead of time, it was worth the wait. :)"
0,"All I can say is yuck. My friend and I came here for a roller derby match tonight and it was so disappointing. The good was that the place was packed for the match. The bad? Let me count the ways. The straight out of the 80's building design and decor was the first bad sign. Then as you begin to enter the building, you feel as though you are entering a dungeon. But again, with so many people there, you think there has got to be some redeeming qualities. We get inside and get some food in the \""snack bar.\"" As we waited in line, I looked around and was too terrified to touch anything. Outdated furnishings and pieces that looked as though they couldn't be cleaned if you wanted to. I bought a bottle water, soft pretzel, and order of fries. Total was $6 which I thought to be very reasonable. The girl told me 3 min on the pretzel and fries. I got the pretzel in 3 min and the fries in 15 min. I was so pissed since the match started by then. When I finally got my food, we went to find seats. That was a total joke. There were folded chairs on the rink floor in addition to the seats on the outside of the rink. Every seat was filled and people standing everywhere. So apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat. Ridiculous. The match was just okay. I thought there would be more action but how much can there be when fans are sitting on the actual site of the match?  We didn't stay for the second match, after all, who wants to stand the whole time? My advice? Have low, low expectations before coming here and it shall not disappoint."
3,"Great atmosphere, even better drinks and service.  The staff was courteous and attentive, offered great suggestions for a novice tequila drinker like myself.  Though I didn't order food, my party had nothing but good to say about the food.\n\nWouldn't mind staying in hotel afterwards, the pool looks absolutely fab."
1,"Was not impressed. I came to Revolution Ale House with high hopes of a tasty pizza and awesome beer.... Didn't happen. They do have a pretty decent beer list which was plus though! My and I friend arrived on a semi busy Saturday night. We had a seat at the bar and ordered drink while we waited for our table, which didn't take long at all. We were taken back to our back patio table after about 5 minutes. We were finally greeted by our server who seemed a bit out of it.... We were in the mood for a margarita pizza and ordered it, he told us he didn't recommend it, that it is thin like a cracker and he \""sees a lot of disappointed faces when he brings it to the table\""...um okay, not a good sign but thanks for your honesty... Soo we ordered the build your own pizza (where each ingredient cost a dollar extra) with tomato, basil and mozzarella (but it also came doused with balsamic vinaigrette like the menu margarita pizza version).. It was okay, very small and not worth the price. We also each ordered a side Caesar salad.. Bland and no flavor. It took a while to get refills and our check (our server said he got sat with a 13 top...okay understandable), when we got our check it was wrong and we had to wait 10 mins more just to get him to come back to our table... Overall... I might come back but just to hang out at the bar."
3,I've been to this upscale version of Cheesecake Factory twice. The first time I had a sashimi appetizer and grilled cheese and short rib sandwich. The sashimi was quite good and the sandwich was greasily delicious. The short ribs were insanely flavorful and moist and really went well with the cheese and bread selections. Despite being very busy the service was exceptionally attentive.
0,I had high hopes to work with Troy. He called right away after I called to set up an appointment. He came by to look at my job and said it was pretty straightforward He then said he would get back with me on a quote. After a week and multiple text messages asking for a quote he never got back to me.
4,"I recommend this place due to the cheap combos, cleanliness, fast service, quality of food, and the wide variety of the food. I go all the time with my family and it's always just as great as the time before. It's rare to actually find real Mexican food but Federico's has it 24/7!!!"
2,"This is a great place to go when you are getting those cravings late night. There is a full bar here and the prices are a little high, but then what do you expect its VEGAS! \nI usually come here for breakfast and its portioned well for the price. Can not go wrong with eggs, bacon, and toast. The service here can be better but i feel like its a hit or miss. There are times where I got amazing service and there are times it can be horrible. If you are looking for a quick breakfast bite then this is a place to go. If you want to spend your money on lunch, I suggest else where."
3,"Tough to find. It's off the street, down an alley/walkway. Can't comment on the food because they were closed for the week."
3,"I was very impressed by the customer service here. I had just gotten a flat across the street, around 5:15 so I drove over to Big O to get a new tire. Little did I know that they close at 5! The guy behind the counter was cool though and still took care of me. They didn't have the tire I needed in stock, but they were nice enough to change my flat to my spare, all for free.\n\nIf they had the tire I needed, I would have bought a whole set of 4!"
4,Great Thai Food with Good Price
4,"Amazing buffet!  We have been coming here for years.  My husband and I like to consider ourselves China buffet experts (how sad is that lol).  This is the cleanest, most consistent Chinese buffet we have been to in 20 years in Phoenix.  We always take relatives and people from out of town here.  The food is fresh.  They are always adding new items.  The sushi is much better than any other buffet.  They make you a great variety of rolls, and they don't skimp on the expensive ingredients.  On crab night they keep the crab legs coming! We have never gotten sick, and we have never had any gross out issues here.  The staff is friendly, and over the years they have gotten to recognizing us and our 4 teens when we walk in.  We are customers for life!"
0,Waited 2 hours for Pauly d on Saturday. Since when did motley Cr\u00fce concerts have anything to do with being able to cut in line???? Bouncers were jerks and they told everyone in line they are expecting tips if you think you're getting in\n\nPissed!!!!!\n\nWish I didn't spend the money on that cab ride
3,"First, let's correct a slight misconception.  This is not exactly Chicago-style pizza.  Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place.  Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.\n\nBut second, it's still fantastic pizza.  It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you).  The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's).  The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great).  I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.\n\nIt's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor.  I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out.  Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in.  And the thin crust is lousy."
2,"This place is pretty good, but it's nothing extraordinary and nothing you can't make yourself at home. I've been to both Scottsdale locations multiple times, ordered different things, and fair warning: don't go to either if you're in a big hurry because they are SLOOWW! They make everything fresh but should have more people or equipment to compensate for the time it takes. I've never seen more than 3 people at a time. \n\nThey also have a punch card but don't tell you, which I find strange. It's by the register and they're happy to give it to you if you see it and ask, but don't expect them to ask you if you want one. I've only been asked if I have one once out of more than 10 trips."
4,"I have been using their service for years and referring to friends.  Most recently our Dishwasher wasn't working.  An appliance guy showed up and said a rodent had eaten through a rubber supply line so we called Jim.  Within 2 hours a tech was onsite and looked at the hose.  The hose was simply off where it was supposed to be because the clamp broke.  No sign of rodents at all.  Their customer service is prompt, professional, and very fair rates.  I would never think of hiring anyone else."
4,I went to an early morning yoga class yesterday and it was absolutely fantastic! I was greeted at the front gate and guided to the yoga studio. Cute studio space and very clean. Carrie's class was amazing! She is a great teacher and very knowledgeable! I am already looking forward to my next class at Inside the Bungalow!
1,"I've heard of this place for some time and as a last minute choice my girlfriend and I tried it out.  We arrived about 8:15 on a Friday and were seated fairly quickly.  The place is cool.  It's definitely a sports bar (which is a plus) and the connection with a former athlete, hometown team guy is cool.  They have a nice selection of microbrews, another plus.  That's about it.  The service was slow and the place was NOT busy.  We ordered burgers and cheese curds along with our beers.  When asked if we wanted the curds to come out first, we said yes.  The beers took a bit to arrive and the food took way too long...and the curds came out with the food.  That's all fine but don't ask if it's not going to come out early.  The curds were awesome but the portion size was quite small for the price.  Our burgers, ordered medium well, came out charred and lacking flavor. We ordered the Arizona (spicy) burger and Bacon & Bleu burger expecting a big flavor.  And a surprise at the end of the evening was that the coupon that they had sent us had fine print \""subject to other rules\"". That's cool too but just tell us, don't surprise us at the end of the evening.  The jury is out whether we'll give it another try as there are a lot of awesome sports bar/restaurants out there."
0,"They just got done with their Kitchen remodel.  Food is really expensive.  It is drive through food with sit down prices and tip.  Food was not season well, portions were ok, they wouldn't  honor my full entertainment book 20% discount.  Really!!!  In this market you need all the friends you can get.  Not a good experience.  Won't be back.  I would stick with an Eribertos or the like."
2,"While heading to Tommy Bahama I was perplexed talking to my friend over the phone who had discovered they were offering a happy hour on a Thursday night. \n\n\""What? You mean the place that sells the Hawaiian shirts?\""\n\nWell yes, they do, but this one has a restaurant/bar attached to it. And they DO have a very wonderful happy hour menu. I started off with a Chardonnay ($6) and then moved on to their Mai Tai ($6). I wish I had had two Mai Tai's! It was delicious and it packed a punch! I was feeling a little tipsy. The presentation was nice too. \n\nI had the fish tacos off the happy hour menu. The tastes were delectable and even though they were tiny little tacos there was plenty of grilled fish in them. I love grilled fish tacos and I hate fried fish tacos, bleck. However they were a bit on the cool side. I think they may have been sitting for a few moments too long before being brought out. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying them.\n\nSo, those are all the good things. Here are some not-so-good things. First off there was a guy there \""playing\"" guitar. I use quotations because half the time he was not actually playing his guitar, but instead messing around with his Mac Book which was playing his music for him? Eh, lame. Next off when I was drinking my wine the bartender swooped up the little decanter she had given me along with the wine glass, well there was still wine in it! My jaw literally dropped and I stared at her in disbelief. She quickly deposited it back in front of me and I snatched it up and poured the rest of the wine in my glass quickly. I don't know if it was an accident, but either way it was incredibly awkward. Lastly, the bartender also dropped off the incorrect check for my friend and I (and then we never saw her again). A new bartender arrived who prodded us into purchasing more drinks, but then left us and never returned to see if we actually wanted more drinks.\n\nLuckily another bartender finally noticed our displeasure because I'm assuming it was radiating from us after being given a check that was #1 not ours and #2 WAY more expensive than our actual check. This bartender was very nice and quick to fix the mix up though.\n\nIn conclusion - Tommy Bahama's not just for ugly pineapple shirts anymore!"
4,I love this place. Never to many people. Almost like having a private screening.
4,"Stopped in here based on nearby restaurants on my yelp app. The 5 stars is no lie, the service we recieved from the cashier was beyond expectations for a sandwich shop. This guy knew everything about every sandwich and was extremely helpful! As if the menu posted in the wall isn't enough there are 400 options online.  WTH. No idea how the can keep all that straight but anyway the sandwiches are really good! We ordeted a meatball sub (Michael Jordan) a pat Tillman and a bear hug. I could only eat half cuz my sub was sooo big. New favorite spot! Ps.. hapoy hour from 4-7 dine in free drink and chips with your sub."
3,Small bowling alley (30 lanes). It was a lot of fun they had good pizza.  We were there for a company party which they were able to accommodate pretty well.
1,"After all of the high reviews, I figured it would be a good place to try out. As I was entering the restaurant, I stopped someone who was leaving with leftovers, that's a good sign. I asked how his experience was. He was less then enthusiastic about the food and service. That was not a good sign.\n\nThe sign says, \""seat yourself.\"" I looked for a good spot to sit and found a table near where other were seated. I found that it had food particles on it and a few napkins. One of the two only active waitresses came by and asked me to go sit on some waiting chairs. I waited while a waitress went to clean the table.\n\nOnce it was clean, she waved me over and I sat down. The seats are nice, no arms, and the temperature was quite cool on a hot Summer 100 degree plus day. Though I did smell cigarette smoke from the bar next door.\n\nThe waitress came by and asked to take my drink order. It was delivered in a fairly large cup, water usually comes by thimble size in restaurants these days, so that was nice.\n\nThen it was time to order an entree. I opted for the Two Meat Combo for $18.99 which comes with two sides. I asked the waitress what were her most ordered sides. She said the sweet potato crumble and mac & cheese. So I ordered those along with a 1/4 chicken and ribs.\n\nMy previous experience with BBQ in Las Vegas stems from many visits to Ellis Island's BBQ and Famous Dave's. Both places serve large meals for good prices. So I was expecting more than what I received and after a pretty good wait.\n\nFor $18.99 I received two ribs and a quarter chicken plus the sides I mentioned above. The temperature of sides were adequate. The sweet potato crumble was initially delicious, after some time, it became too much for me to finish. The other person I went with ordered a potato salad, which was much better. The mac & cheese was tasty. The chicken and ribs should have been super hot. They were slightly warm to the touch, not what I was looking for. The person I went with also ordered the 1/4 chicken. It too was slightly warm, but not hot.\n\nThe person I went with got their 1/4 chicken and two sides for $10.99. How can they justify two ribs for an extra $8?\n\nOur waitress was nice, the water tasted clean and the sides were good. The temperature needs to be turned up a lot on the meat served and I unfortunately ended up smelling like a cigarette."
2,"It is your traditional Olive Garden type restaurant. Service was pretty good. Food was mediocre. I ate there, probably won't go back. It just wasn't that outstanding. If you're looking for a nice relaxing place to eat outdoors, this is a pretty place. \n\nAt the risk of sounding like a fake Yelper....let me tell you about a place I found nearby that was AMAZING. Check out Rice Trax. Wish they'd been open on Sunday, then I wouldn't have had to eat at Brio. ;-)"
4,great gluten free place. And I finally got to eat garlic bread again!
3,"Located in a a basement, almost completely unmarked. The male waitstaff was dressed in black, very professional and you sort of wonder if the sleeve tattoo is the uniform. The waitress (there was only one) was dressed in white daisy dukes which didn't seem to be as professional attire for a restaurant of this calibre. The food was good and flavourful, though serving mixed drinks before a meal is usually frowned upon (it dulls the palate.) The food was freshly cooked. The menu was nice. The only hiccup was dessert, the pancakes were extremely heavy... definitely the low spot on our dinner."
4,"This store has it goin on, not the cheapest but they have everything if your on the way the airport and need some gifts fast,  Kick-ass hot sauce? Got it!  Cactus Candy? - Got it! ,  Red cowboy hat ?  Got it! - 5 foot long stuffed rattlesnake? - Got it!"
4,Ordered cupcake delivery for my sister-in-law's birthday and they were awesome!!! Same day delivery and they put together a great assortment.  Rob was amazing- top notch customer service even when we had some issues (my fault on the wrong address) with the delivery location.  Rob was able to get it to the right place with a smile!  Great job Gigi's and thank you for making her birthday special.
0,"Bad. There's tons of places you can eat on the Strip, and I felt awful being here. Food wasn't very good, either bland or really salty, and not much in between. You're better off exploring somewhere else in Caesars or Bellagio. I probably should've realized that when I didn't see very many people in here.\n\nWe also had a douchey French server that didn't seem to care about anything."
2,"Very beautiful, but very expensive!  I only had a few hours in the city so I asked a friend of mine who'd lived there for a few years where I should go if there was only one place to visit. I wish I had more time and discovered the poutineries sooner, and a bigger appetite! We left only taking in the sights, and having an expensive, diluted sangria with \""free\"" nachos which were really gross (I never knew you could screw up nachos!). I'd give this place a second chance though and check out some other parts of Old Montreal."
4,"I went to the west side Firefly location for the first time last night. I was meeting a large group, but I got there first so I had a drink at the bar. The bar was busy, but the bartender looked cool and calm and I had excellent service, he even took the time to go through some of their new wines with me and I ended up trying a malbec that was amazing. I talked with the couple next to me and they come in at least twice a week. They said they even like it better than the one near the strip, which I was surprised to hear. My group finally showed up and we were seated right away. There was eight of us total. Our waiter was so nice and friendly from the moment he walked up to the table. He recommended some of his personal favorite tapas dishes and of course we had several pitchers of the famous sangria. The entire staff was great. from the hostess, the bartender, the waiter, the busser I honestly had no complaints... Except that I ate too much ;) The manager even came by our table twice throughout our dining experience to check on us. It seemed as if the staff worked well as a team and that's what makes a restaurant one I want to go to. I will and already have recommended the Sahara location to many of my friends and plan on being there for happy hour later this week. See you there!"
4,This was a GREAT Yelp find in Las Vegas! We were wanting to try something off the strip and came across this place. Will most definately go back!!
4,"So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  After getting lost and going to the closed location, I finally found this one at market square.  I paid for parking and boy was it worth it!\n\nThe classic pastrami is too good! Crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries!  Lived up to the hype! Trip was worth it."
2,"Jiro would send you back to pounding octopus.\n\nIn Japan you only get to cut the fish after you've shown your skill with the knife. Here you probably do it in your first week on the job.  There's no way the chef cut our fish. It looked like the  tuna had been rescued from a shark attack. The uni was not the freshest. The fish selection was restricted and mostly run of the mill.\n\nOn the other hand the fish was mostly of very good quality, and the service was excellent. Prices are fair."
2,"Such mixed reviews of this place. I've been for HH a few times. It was always so busy and crowded that I honestly don't remember the food. Was just there last week and got a table. The food was good. Not anything to glow about, but it was about what I'd expect. The place itself is really nice and in a great location. I still miss Zen 32 though,"
1,"I'm just not that impressed. The menu isn't that great.  The prices are higher than they should be for what you get.  They atmosphere is fun in a \""this was designed to look like every other fun location\"" kind of way - but completely lacks it's sincerity.  \n\nI've gone twice with someone who LOVES seafood, and her favorite restaurant is Red Lobster (Ultimate Feast every time...).  Even she wasn't impressed.  It didn't do anything for her.  She said it appeared that the crab legs had been previously frozen and then re-heated too quickly (she thought maybe microwave).  I don't cook, but she does more than regularly so I'm going to trust her on that one.  \n\nWe wanted to like it so we tried once more in case it was a bad night for both them and us and decided that really, this just wasn't it for us.  \n\nTheir \""Free Crab Tomorrow\"" sign always makes me smile, but at least now I know to laugh at the joke and just keep on driving."
1,"We went a month or 2 ago.  A couple of the exhibits were closed.  They shut down an entire section (the part where you look like you're under a doc or inside a ship or something).  When I asked about this, the girl knew nothing about any sections being closed.  I told her I have photos of my kids in this section and it's completely gone.  She didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nThe theater smelled like A*S, the picture was bad, the sound was bad.  It was hot in there.\n\nI got creeped thinking about touching anything in there, I wouldn't let my kids use the interactive displays because I was afraid they would catch some virus.  It did not have a feeling of being clean at all.  The second we got out of there I went and found some sanitizer. \n\nThe interactive game at the end was broken and did nothing when you walked on it. In fact we've been there 3 times and the interactive game has never worked.  What's up with that?\n\nThe play area looked pretty beat up and dirty.\n\nOne of the bubbles you stick your head in to see inside the tank smelled like someone puked or peed in there or both!  How hard is it to clean??\n\nI mean, this place hasn't been open that long and it's already looking run down and old.  \n\nI picked up some discount tickets.  I paid $15 and got 4 adult tickets, so it was a good deal, but I certainly would be disappointed if I paid full price for this.\n\nAdvice:  Clean it up, add in some new stuff, fix everything.  Make sure it doesn't SMELL like a Jr. High locker room!\n\nI suggest you go to the Wildlife World Zoo and get a Zoo and Aquarium for about the same price."
3,This is a nice place to attend special events.  Home to the restaurants of two James Beard award winning chefs is a big plus as well!
3,"happy to upgrade my rating!  \n\nwe stopped by for some drinks and apps.  i was very happy with the cheese curds and we had a seasonal heirloom tomato with stuffed squash blossom appetizer.. the latter was just fabulous.  so fresh and the seasoning was perfect.  i wish i could eat it again and again.\n\n\naaaannndd... again i had another lovely meal.  yummy tofu scramble, though the bloody mary was a bit too far on the horseradishy side.   the cheesecurds didn't fail to disappoint, once again.."
3,"Well my roommate and I have been living at Courtney Village since October 2013, and honestly don't have many complaints about the place! my neighbors upstairs are very sweet, the staff here has always acknowledged me when I walk through the door (unless they are speaking with someone which I understand its rude to break a conversation) only negatives is the parking....if you have more then one car you are going to have a bad time.. another pro is that they are open on Sundays which is a great positive to a girl who works Monday thru Friday  and cant make it to pick up her package, all in all the negative reviews shock me because I love the layout of my 2 bed 2 bath apartment, very quiet neighborhood and I haven't had anyone \""messing with my car ( although I have a car alarm so that may be why, so honestly you cant believe all the negative reviews because each apartment complex and personality is different! I was just fortunate enough to actually have great neighbors :) I feel Courtney must have changed in 2013 because it deserves 4 stars 5 if they can ether lower the garage payment to rent it or to create closer parking spaces near us haha"
1,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed the concert I saw last night, but... While it is just a music venue and my expectations weren't set that high, the marquee failed to live up to even those.\n\nI was there with Andrew K, and agree about the fees, the line to get in, and the sticky floors. The sign of a good venue is how efficiently they handle crowds, and they fail at this. But I'd also like to talk about the bar. The servers were friendly enough, but they had tacky hand written in marker signs that read \""we can only run your card once, please start a tab.\"" When I tried to oblige, I was told their system can only handle 100 tabs so I couldn't. Ridiculous."
3,"What can I say about this place other than great energy, amazing DJ's, and the line doesn't take long to get through unlike many other clubs in Vegas.  \n\nI went for back to back nights and had a blast both nights."
0,Ripoff!!!! They advertise 1/2 off rolls on Sunday- not really... $95 later we left. Pissed off and will never go back again!!!! No wonder you have no customers.
1,"For a cheaper price, they have a larger selection than many other asian buffet places but the quality in some of their food isn't there.  I found hair in the food.  On the plus side, they have good char sui."
3,"Never thought this would happen but I've discovered a couple sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich that I wasn't too crazy about!  Don't get me wrong -- I still love the quality of the Tuna Melt which I always order, and then I get another sandwich that I save for later or take back to my man.  So far, a huuuge thumbs up for the chipotle chicken avocado and the Earl Club.  However, the Hawaiian BBQ and BLT were kind of a disappointment.  I only ate half of each.  The bacon was too thick on the BLT and for some reason smelled like peanut butter.  There's still so many more sandwiches for me to try though, so I'll definitely keep coming back when I go back to Vegas. \n\nService is still as quick as ever so don't be intimidated by a long line.  If ordering soup, check to make sure you got the right one!  They gave my friend the wrong soup and she didn't realize til we got back to our hotel room."
3,"I've heard a lot of good things about Serendipity 3 from my friends who came to Vegas on vacation, but I never had a chance to eat there until recently. Since this place was close to the Linq, a friend and I decided to eat here.\n\nThere was a helpful banner that said that the restaurant was open which was nice since it looked like part of the outside was under construction. We entered from the side and the hostess greeted us warmly before directing us to a table. The decor was a little goofy looking, but I liked it.\n\nThe menu was huge and it took a bit for me to figure out what to order. It finally came down to ordering a portobello mushroom burger with fries because I love mushrooms. My friend ordered a salad with a crab cake.\n\nThe food arrived and the first bite of my burger was amazing. My friend took a bite of her rather large crab cake and was pleased that the crab was fresh instead of frozen. Our waiter kept coming around to ask us how we were doing and refilling our water, which I like."
0,"I was gonna do a two star review but as I hovered over the one star it said \""Eek! Methinks not.\"" as a suggestion- while I feel that one star is harsh, this is truly how I felt coming into the shopping center this place is located in. The owner is cool and nice for sure.......annnnnnd I'm about to become the only person to leave a 1 star review. Public enemy #1. Here I go...\n\nThe sandwiches aren't bad but it really isn't worth the trip, in my humble opinion. The strip mall it is located in is single handedly the most desolate looking strip mall I have ever been in. ATTENTION CHARLOTTE FILM: This place would be wonderful to use for a violent movie scene. It is what nightmares are made of. Cigarette butts everywhere inside, trash, vacant window shopping, unfilled water ponds, dust, mold, token homeless/mentally ill dude- this is the fucking boulevard of broken dreams.\n\nBy all means go, it will make a good story. The baguette was great and they sell them for 70 cents. The bahn mi is nothing special. We tried half the menu. I make better bahn mi's at home- they're really easy to make and fairly cheap. They don't use mayo but rather the margarine that is one molecule away from plastic. Our group was wondering how they can get away with selling bahn mi's at $3-$3.50 a pop, and we then joked because rent is probably $100. If you decide to come, you will see why. You cannot argue with that. The strip mall being in the state it is in...You can't help but feel it is unsanitary even though the storefront looks clean. Le's Sandwiches aren't bad but they're not 5 stars. \n\nThere's no sign indicating the place exists in the front of the strip mall. ATTENTION HIPSTERS: JACKPOT! Le's Sandwiches needs to get the hell outta there and across the street into Dino's space or somewhere more reputable that does not look like the back drop for A Serbian Film. Or Hobo With A Shotgun. \n\nI hate to not fit in with the rest of the Yelpers fawning over this place...but 4 1/2 stars while some of the best restaurants in Charlotte are getting 3 1/2? Y'all are being hipsters."
4,"After an awful experience at San Antonio's we decided to try Paco's Tacos and Tequila. We have been back three times and each time has been wonderful. The beef brisket tacos are amazing, and the jalapeno infused tequila margarita is the best margarita I have ever had. Everything is fresh, authentic, priced well, and service is great! Thank you for putting this great restaurant in South Park!"
4,I absolutely love the food here.   I had the Bun Bo Hue- the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and it was amazing.  Spicy but not too spicy.    The staff was nice and it is best to go before the dinner rush.\n\nI never tried Vietnamese food before and this place made me glad I did  give it a try.
1,"Came here for lunch with a friend one day... and I guess my darn expectation ruined it for me again.  With an overall good review, I thought I would get better food.  The truth is, it's so forgettable that I forgot what I had.  I believe I had the seafood noodles in soup.  It's quite pricey for the little seafood I got in my bowl.  \n\nWith the amount of Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte, there are better options.  Amazingly the place was pretty packed for lunch.  Guess location location location."
0,"I didn't know what to expect but had hoped that with a name like \""garlic & shots\"" that maybe it was going to be fun and creative.  The $5.00 off coupon stuck under the windshield wiper window was the deciding factor.\n\nHostess was overly enthusiastic about seating us. \n\nChairs look like banquet chairs that had a cover over them.  Nicely done.\n\nThere's a lit, glass display case in the dining area that contains spent bottles of wine and champagne.  I would suggest they dispose of those bottles and find some theme for tchotchkes and/or floral arrangements to display in the case to add a little more ambiance to the room.\n\nPrinted menu on a 8 1/2\"" x 11\"" paper included appetizers, salads (?), and three entrees.  Another piece of paper was handed to us with todays specials -Fish & Chips and a Salmon entree.\n\nWine selection was okay.\nOrdered a glass and had already begun to drink it when server asks if we would like to try some shots.  \nWine with shots, no thank you.\n\nNo salt or pepper on any of the tables, but we were asked if we wanted it.  How do we know if we haven't had a chance to taste our food?!\nWas served a bullet of ketchup when requesting some for my fries.\n\nNot all servers are knowledgeable about their products on the menus.\n\nOur server picked up our coupon but didn't apply it to our bill.  When I inquired about the discount he asked if we told the hostess.  \nOur transaction needed to be voided and rerun with the discount.\n\nMusic sounded like Muzak until live musician started performing in the bar.  He played one song and then excused himself for a few so he could find the right balance (I forgot exactly what he said) for the room.  He played a few bars and sang a few phrases of various songs and then I believe he resumed his set.\n\nMIGHT give them another chance."
2,"Oh crap, I hate, hate writing mediocre reviews when everyone else writes great reviews. So I'm going positive first:\n\nThe service was GREAT! Well, the waitstaff. I'll start from the beginning: We just got back from Wet 'n Wild where I mentioned, if you read that review, I didn't bring a hairbrush much less took a shower.  We decided to visit Roaring Fork as it's on my husband's burger list and we rarely get this far north. So we drive down Scottsdale road and surprised to find it in an office building. \n\nWe walk in looking like crap with our messy boys and we are completely ignored by the two hostesses who are engaged in conversation with an older gentleman. So we walk around the restaurant and decide to go back to the hostess and see if we need to be seated. So I rudely interrupted their deep conversation and ask if they need to seat us. One of them said yes, if you are eating dinner or you can seat yourself if you want the happy hour in the bar or patio. We said we'll do the happy hour.\n\nWe went t to the patio which on this 108* day into evening was wonderful. The decor was so nice I wish my home patio looked so good and the misters were great even though by the end of the evening I was soaked. The waiter was very attentive and made a great beer suggestion. We ordered  the Big Ass Burgers for $9 and an order of Guacamole and the boys ordered mac & cheese. \n\nThe Guac was amazing, perfect with big chunks of avocado and onion, chip were fresh. The beer was served with chilled, small glasses - great presentation.   The burgers were HUGE, I didn't think for $9 you would really get a HUGE burger and Fries but you do. The burger looks great, super thick cooked to order with thick bacon, cheddar, tomato, poblano chile, nice lettuce, tons of pickles with an aioli on the side. What could be wrong? \n\nHmmm, I bite, chew, swallow, add aioli, bite, add salt. Just can not get any flavor from the meat.  This burger should be amazing. The bread is a really generic, white seeded bun so I get rid of it and used a fork and knife. Just no flavor so I both my husband and I only ate half of our burgers. The waitstaff seemed confused by our full plates but it just wasn't great and not worth the cholesterol or calories. The boys were happy with the mac & cheese and ate most of our fries. The guac and beer were great! And the service, except the host staff, was truly wonderful.  \n\nWe would probably go back as we liked the ambiance and give it another try hopefully just an off night. Total for two beers, guacamole, mac & cheese x2, burgers x2 was only $45."
2,My friend Leung's uncle own this place and that is not the reason I am biased! It is good food. It is small restaurant but they are fast!
3,"I didn't have my expectations set very high after only seeing a 3 1/2 star average on Yelp.  But I was pleasantly surprised as the tacos were good, and the happy hour was even better.  I had the trio of shrimp tacos and our table shared some guacamole, carne asada tostadas, and steak fries.  Everything was really good, and the pacing of the food was great as well.  I definitely prefer the hole in the wall Mexican joint most of the time, but the upscale Mexican restaurant has it's place and this one is a good one."
2,"Food gets FIVE STARS, Service takes two stars away. I know they are always busy, but then get more staff!  I do love and crave the shrimp Scampi."
4,"Thanks so much Mike and Jay.  You did a great job on my car.  I love it when I can refer a friend knowing that they will receive exceptional service.  You guys are so professional and do such a great job explaining all of my options.  As soon as I purchase my home, I will have you do my residential windows also."
1,"The food was very good.\n\nSamplings from Fuku Burger & 9ine were also good but not outstanding.  My wife loved the green tea mochi. \n\nThe big downer was that it was so hot this evening.  I don't understand why this couldn't have taken place later October during the evening?  There should have been more water bottles; there was too much booze and not enough H2O.\n\nOverall,\n\nI felt this event was more for the fake and plastic people of the Las Vegas night life, not serious food and wine connoisseurs.  More people were seen floundering about, drunk, rather than enjoying the atmosphere, food, and wine.\nVendor representatives spent no time explaining their products; more like them just passing them out for flavor.  The DJ, dance floor, and annoying music made me think twice about attending a \""food and wine\"" event by a pool again."
1,I have been wanting to try this place for a while and was very dissappointed. The woman behind the counter was clearly annoyed that I wanted to order. The food although very tasty was very fatty. There was very little meat that wasn't all fat. The tables were all dirty and it wasn't very busy and when I asked the woman behind the counter for some napkins to wipe one down she didn't even budge to come wipe them down. There were only two tables taken in the whole place and it wasn't busy enough for her not to be able to get away from the counter. I don't think we will be back. Didn't seem like it was worth the money for a bunch of fatty meat and indifferent service.
1,"I stayed here for a convention, and despite its majesty from outside, the inside is showings its age.\n\nFirst, the front desk is very fast and helpful, but the place nickles and dimes you for everything. I had a package sent to the casino, they charged me a $7 receiving fee... WTF!?\n\nThe casino floor is nothing special from the myraid of slot machines and gambling tables.. Rouge (bar) was a lot of fun just to hang out but the most annoying thing was that no mattter where you went, there were people handing out 'free passes' to the other night club.. By the time i made it to the elevators, i  had already been hit 4 times and had 10 free passes.\n\nSo the rooms, were typical, big bathroom and mine had a very nice view of the airport and the 'pink airplane'.\n\nNow the negatives, and one is of the 'eww' factor.\n\nFirst, I rate a hotel on the comfort of the bed, and shower head and just general amenities.\n\nFirst the bed, was very comfortable, but after the first night, i noticed that there was a smell coming from somewhere... I sniffed around, and it turned out to be one of the pillows, which absolutely smelled like puke.. I threw it on the floor and put a note on it for the cleaning crew titled \""This pillow smells like vomit, thank you very much\"".\n\nIt was promptly changed the next morning.\n\nThe second thing, and one of my wierd quirks about hotels are the shower heads. In an attempt to SAVE water they put these water saving heads on them, which really cause you to stay in longer, perhaps not saving any water at all. Mine was like a freakin water jet... Yes it had good coverage, but the pressure going through the nozzle was actually a little painful. You can't adjust the water pressure from the faucet because its one of those Cold[----------]Hot types and the head itself had no controls, so five nights of 'deal with it'\n\nLastly, the rooms are in need of just general maintenance. The faucet to the sinks liked (out of the handles), and the TV is a staticy analog tve with crappy display. I bought a movie and had to turn it off because the display was so distorted.\n\nThere is better... The 'signature' suites are really nice, but i will not be returning to the old-school MGM, there is better out there."
0,"I had high hopes for this authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison, but here's the reality of my dining experience:\n\nWe ordered three assorted tacos, a chicken gordita, a pastor quesadilla and cheese quesadillas. \n\n1. There were flies everywhere, lots of them\n2. The dining area floor was dirty, tables were filthy and sticky\n3. The help-yourself salsa bar is a great idea, but the salsas were not fresh.\n4. Waitstaff was friendly but slow - and we were the only patrons for the dinner hour!\n5. This was the greasiest Mexican food I've ever had in my life.\n6. The food was nothing special.\n\nMy search for amazing Mexican food in Madison continues..."
0,"I wouldn't even give this place a star. We checked in at midnight after a long drive excited to get some rest.. I booked a double king room when we got to our room there were 2 full size beds, if you want to call them beds, I think I would have slept more comfortable in there parking lot. Then to top it off the air conditioner made this shaking sound all night like a washing machine on the spin cycle and randomly a loud slam like our neighbor slamming there door I turned off the air but the noise didn't stop.. really enjoyable night. Last I went in the bathroom to find am ice bucket of a yellowish clear liquid on the back of the toilet..not sure what it was but it looked to be pee. I wouldn't even walk back in to this place if you paid me."
4,"They were doling out free samples of the Youth berry tea and I loved it right away, so I purchased a bag of that one as well as a bag of the Queen Of Babylon White Tea.  I normally don't even like white tea, but this one is just exceptional!\n\nMy sales person was Ambrose L. and clerk was Donovan W.  Both were friendly, knowledgeable and professional, but especially Ambrose.\n\nMy only complaint is there there is no Teavana store in Philadelphia, where I live.  There needs to be one in the 19125 zip code...please open one up here :)"
1,"Sometimes you're better off with a happy memory of something than the reality of how things are in the present. I haven't been in Madison for a while, but remember how much I liked the food and service when I was a starving student and they were pretty much the only place on State Street that wasn't serving Gyros, Burgers, or Pizza. \n\nOur party arrived around 7PM, midweek. It wasn't crowded- there were maybe three other people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes or so for anyone to greet us. When we were seated, our tables hadn't been bussed and we had to ask for someone to clean them and bring us some menus. Things picked up when we finally got a waitress to notice us. The food arrived fairly quickly- I had a combo platter of soft tacos, with mole on the side. The tortillas and fixings were good for the most part, but the beans and rice were dried up to the extent where I wondered if it had ever been cooked completely, or just sat out somewhere for a few days. After getting our food, the waitstaff vanished. No water, no follow-up, no nothing. We actually had to look around for someone to give us our bill. Well, someone else's bill. We did get things straightened out, but sheese, how can you not want to get paid what you're owed?\n\nI probably won't ever come back again if they're somehow still in business next time I'm in the area. All in all, a very disappointing visit."
2,"The food here is decent...maybe a bit mediocre. I like the variety on the menu but the execution was not quite as good. The ambience is nice, but of course you're sitting at the House of Blues! \n\nI tried the lobster mac n' cheese and it was good. The lobster was quite flavorless and could have been crab for all I knew, but the mac n' cheese was darn yummy and I could have eaten it all by myself. Except I also split it with my coworker along with a cajun jambalaya...which was quite disappointing. And a little dry and not spicy.\n\nI would come back for a show, but never for food."
1,"I don't know. Passing by this place on the way to Planet Hollywood, I thought that this place sounded pretty bomb. We decided to stop by this place to order some food to take back to our hotel, and I didn't really feel like getting a sandwich or anything, so I ordered the cevice and chips, and also their lobster bisque. I spent $20, which I suppose I expected for ordering lobster, but the quality of the food was sub-par. I kinda chuckled when I opened the container for the cevice, and there was the cevice in a small soup container with a few lonesome chips. I probably can safely say this was my least favorite cevice I've ever had... Didn't taste that great, the chunks were too big to pick up with their flaky chip, and it just looked un-appetizing. \n\nOh, and I tried a sample of their lobster ice cream.. Just tastes like vanilla icecream with random chunks in it. Probably wouldn't actually purchase it ever."
4,Always awesome
4,"I have to admit - growing up in LA I became somewhat of a Thai food snob.  When we moved to the Northwest 'burbs of Las Vegas, we were certainly surprised when we discovered Pin Kaow in a very nondescript strip mall so close to home.  Really wonderful food that easily rivals any we had in LA's Thai Town. \n\nThe NW space has expanded over the years - but the interior has always been pleasant with wood floors and tasteful Thai art on the walls.  The wait staff are in traditional-style attire and flawlessly pleasant.  We usually get the pad thai and panang curry - at a spice level of 6 or so.  The food is wonderful - with my only gripe being that the spice level seems to fluctuate wildly from chef to chef.  Sometimes a 6 is just right, sometimes the heat is barely there.\n\nNow, if only they could import Thai Elvis..."
2,"Slices is good for a East Coast pizza fix. Nice thin slices, heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas. Cheap, quick eats for lunch!"
2,"I am not generally a buffet person, but as they say, \""when in Vegas\""....\n\nBeing the good yelper that I am, I did a lot of research on the important subject of \""buffets\"" before my latest trip to Vegas.  Everyone has their own opinion as to which is the best, but Wicked Spoon looked the most unique to me.\n\nSince it was a holiday weekend, the dinner price was $47.99. I was kind of expecting to get some extras because of the holiday, but it appeared to be the usual fare.  What I found disappointing about the buffet, was that it does not have nearly the selection that I thought it would. It was large for a standard buffet, but I felt it was small for a Vegas buffet.  I have read that the carving station is the best part of this buffet, but I majorly disagree.  The sausage had a weird flavor, the ribs were very dry, and so was the prime rib.  We came early in the evening, so maybe they bring a larger selection of meat out later on...\n\nMy highlights were the salads, the poke, the gnocchi and the desserts.  The food is all presented really well, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good!  The exception is the dessert, it looks and tastes good.  I was told they have a famous pastry chef on staff, and you can tell.  Save room for the gelato!"
0,"the worst service ive ever seen! it seems they dont like tourist in there!! i was meeting with my friends there and bartender was really rude! my drivers license didnt work for her! ive been using it in every casino, bar, etc but pt's bartender seems to be soo special it wasnt good for her. she ruin our night"
2,"Went at dinner time on a Sunday night and there was no wait and we were seated promptly. Wife ordered the sweet and sour pork with a side of white rice, I ordered the chicken and rib combo with fried rice and vegetables. Food came out in about 20 min, and it was ok. Wife enjoyed her food, my chicken was dry, and the ribs were good, but not great. The fried rice was ok, would have been better if they gave you the option to add shrimp or chicken to it, but since it came with the meal that wasnt an option. The thing I don't like is 90% of the sides are a la carte so if you want chow mein or fried rice with your meal be prepared to pay $10-$15 more. Overall you can get better and that's sad for me to say as I'm a big NYNY fan. Our waitress ( who was the bartender helping out) was awesome!!!"
0,"I was here last month to purchase a pair of Shoes and waited to be served, When the server came to me he asked if I spoke French and I said no, he then was serving me and another customer walked in and he just left me and went to serve the man in French, after 20 min he came back and when I requested 5 different pairs to see the size he told me they all were not in stock and kept wanting me to buy the most expensive one, which he would need to order.  I told 3 times I did not want the more expensive ones and he laughed and said in French Les juifs and laughed, (Jews) which I was visibly wearing a kippah Jewish scull cap.  I could not believe the service here!  Salesman name was Pierre, and there were 3 employees working that day, 1 was helping another customer another was free in the back.. If they really were busy they could have called the free one from the back...\n\n I was told by others that Les Ailes de la Mode has many workers who refuse to speak English and treat those who do speak English very poorly, just like the way I was!"
4,"We have our bikes tuned up every spring from the friendly folks at Revolution Cycles, and have always been pleased with the service, quality, and value. Being able to walk there from our home is a plus, too.\n\nA few years back, they even gave my wife a milk crate when we were having trouble finding one for her. Long story short, they're good people."
1,"I went with my family and family friends, and we were all not so impressed. Food was worse than buffet food in Vegas. Show was not particularly interesting or engaging. We had been to Medieval times outside NY a few times and loved it, and both food and performance were just, well, much worse. Disappointing really. The whole ordeal was short -- less than 1.5 hours -- fortunately!  Save your money and time for Medieval Times!\n\nThe scripted hand to hand combat scene was a bit cool, but that's it!"
2,"I didn't love it. We went to the restaurant by recommendation. It was hidden as people say with no marking on the door.\n\nBecause they were full, we were not able to get a table and sat in a bar like area overlooking other guests. We were fine with it, but I don't think the other guests liked it.\n\nWe only ordered appetizers and those took a very long time to come out. We had three appetizers and ended up sitting in the restaurant for two hours mainly waiting for them. The kitchen was small and place was small so it seemed like the kitchen staff was stretched - at least that's how the slow service was explained to us. The good thing about the waiters was that they were knowledgable and gave us the information we needed about the food and what to expect with timing.\n\nFood was good, but not spectacular. I ordered tuna tartar with peppers. It tasted different than how I normally like it. I am a fan of sour flavors but this one was the natural taste of tuna with the sweet mix of the cooked pepper. Raw oysters were good and the kimchi patties were good too. \n\nOverall, the food was good. The main reasons I didn't enjoy the place as much was that it was in line with my pallet, the service was slow and from what we were told my expectations were too high."
0,"Again, Please Yelp I don't want to leave a star!!!!\n\nMy sister was in town for 3 weeks so we thought we would take her for a nice seafood dinner. We had heard that Landry's was a good place with great atmosphere. We entered and were greeted by a very nice young woman that sat us right away.\n\nWe were seated and waited about 10 minutes but that was ok since they were so busy. Our server arrived and we ordered our drinks and since we had waited we were also ready to order our food. This seemed to bother our server as I guess we broke her rhythm. I made the mistake of ordering iced tea because I never got a refill until I was almost done with my meal and I had to ask again to even get that because she forgot. The food was so so not really in keeping with all the hype we had gotten about the restaurant. Long John Silver would have been better....no kidding. The fish wasn't blackened like we asked, the shrimp were cut in half to make them look bigger on the plate and my sisters meal was mostly a bunch of fried greasy onion strings again to make the plate look full. Our server brought the check and didn't even ask if we would like dessert. Poor Service means we won't be going back."
2,"3 1/2 stars to their credit.  I like my burgers, and I like em fresh, I like em beefy, and I like em simple!  Not overdone with too much toppings that take away from the beef.  Ever heard of In N' Out?  That's what a hamburger's all about!  They do it simple...but right.\n\nCreate I tried with the fam on a whim.  We always pass by it and I've seen the good reviews.  I said to myself, \""Self...why not?  Give it a shot!\""  The restaurant is nice, clean, quite modern-y.  Stainless steel, bold colors, very pleasing.  We were welcomed by two high-school employees, and right away were asked if we had been to Create before...to which I replied a healthy \""Nope!  But Yelp seems to like you guys!\""  We were given the rundown of how it all works:  start with your size of burger, choose a bread, choose a cheese, choose your toppings (lots of em'), then choose a sauce!  So many friggin' combinations (I can't count exactly, even though yes I am Asian and yes I am good at math)...it drove me nuts!  The possibilities were endless!  So much so, they actually gave you a little pad and pencil to mark what you wanted on your burger!  Thankfully, Create has some featured burger combos you can choose from as well to lessen the stress.\n\nFor the four of us we chose two 1/2 pound burgers to share.  The first one was the 'Modernist' ($9.93) - sauteed mushrooms, avocado, tomato, Swiss cheese, and chipotle sauce.  The other burger was a 'Create Your Own' ($8.63).  We went crazy on this one!  Tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, romaine lettuce, roasted red peppers, alfalfa sprouts (I love this on sandwiches), with Pepper Jack cheese, mayo and spicy mustard!  These combos come with fries and a drink, but for a nominal charge we upgraded our fries to sweet potato fries and onion rings.  \n\nThe verdict?  Not bad!  Our burgers were cooked just right (lil' bit of pink in the middle), the bread was fresh, and the burgers were huge!   There was enough for the four of us to share.  The Modernist was very good, and our creation of a burger wasn't bad either.  I think next time I'll try a sauce with a little more kick.  The sweet potato fries were good but not as crispy as I like them.  The onions rings were great, I wish the serving was a bit bigger!  They were good dipping in a side of ranch.  \n\nIf you go to Create don't forget to try their frozen custard!  It is actually quite yummy.  They run at least 4-5 different flavors daily.  You can get scoops in a cup or cone then put various toppings on them, you can have a shake, or you can have Create's version of a Blizzard...the 'Concrete'.  We opted to try two Concretes in their sundae size ($4.99).  We got the 'Smithsonian' - vanilla frozen custard with hot fudge, caramel, pecans, whipped cream, and a cherry.  We also tried their 'Van Gogh Bananas' - vanilla frozen custard with bananas, hot fudge, fresh strawberries, caramel, peanuts, whipped cream, and a cherry.  Both were scrumptious!  I myself favored the Van Gogh Bananas because it was like a banana split.  Great way to end our meal.  Also a great way to make me start thinking about the dreaded treadmill again.  Ha!\n\nCreate is an awesome way to make a burger that's all your own.  We will most likely be back here again sometime soon.  Burgers and custard are health foods, right?  Right.  And I love to keep on a healthy diet!"
1,"This is the review for their happy hour.\n\nThe Skinny:  so-so on the verge of mediocre food (2.5) service: we were at the bar and it was okay (3) value: extremely expensive and certainly not worth the expense. Avoid! (2).\n\nI've never been a real fan of steakhouses however we recently received a coupon in the mail for $25 off $50 purchase at T-bones. The hubs previously had been there for their happy hour specials and suggested we do this because their regular menu is vastly overpriced. As well, he stipulated that we were not to go on Friday because they charge extra tax for live entertainment. Not usually one to enjoy live music with dinner (I'm more a quiet sort), I agreed.\n\nSo we get there right at 5pm and put down our order: a Beef on Weck ($19), Ahi Tuna tacos ($9), Buffalo Chicken Bites ($10), Chicken and Waffles ($10) and Lobster Corn Dogs ($10).\n\nI have no idea what they were thinking charging this much for such subpar cuisine. \n\nBeef on Weck = Beef on Wreck. It was essentially overcooked prime rib on the equivalent of a Wonderbread bun smothered in bland (thickened with corn starch) au jus. The amount of au jus just killed the dish, making the bread all weird and mucky. It reminded me of the sh*(ty recipes they made us try during home ec class from like a 50's cookbook (let's make Welsh rarebit using Velveta - nasty!). Albeit it was large and came with fries, I'd wager you'd get a better beef sammy at Arbys for about 1/4 of the price. Lame!\n\nThe buffalo chicken bites although the flavors were okay, the lack of crispiness really killed it. If you are going to deep fry chicken bites, I want to taste to deep fried goodness. Otherwise what's the point of adding all those extra calories?\n\nLobster corn dogs were also very weak = too much coating, too little lobster plagued this completely forgettable dish. It comes with two small lobster corndogs.\n\nAhi Tuna Tacos were okay. There were three small tacos, with some low grade ahi-tuna dressed with avocado. Solid but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere.\n\nThe chicken and waffles were also edible and possibly the best dish of the night. The coating of the chicken was okay and the hit of the jalapeno was nice. The waffle was nothing special and I would argue hit too heavily on the vanilla side. I'm not so sure but as a rule: vanilla + savory = bleh. 'Nuff said.\n\nOverall, given the subpar food alone - I would generally not recommend this place at all. Throw in the ripe off prices, I'd say avoid this place like the plague. (2 starred review)."
1,Went there for the thanksgiving dinner. What a mistake! Dry turkey with horrible tasting green beans. Also ordered mojitos and they were the worse I've had. I do not know about the rest of the menu but the thanksgiving dinner was overpriced and gross. The two stars are for the dinner roles and the parmesan chips.
0,"This place is so gross!  Stale bread, rude employees and a boring sandwich makes for a place we will never visit again. Sorry jimmy you will never see another dollar from me.  Go to jersey mikes it's way better!"
4,"This is an AWESOME store! He has some really great Mid-Century pieces and a ton of other really good \""las Vegas\"" style stuff. I love this place, and always do a walk through when in the area!"
2,"Noticed this place after a dinner at Pita Jungle. I have a new found love for gelato so I decided to check it out.\n\nThe gentleman working the counter must have been an owner as he commented on his wife making all the flavors. Anytime an establishment is run by an owner it tends to be great friendly service. Yay mom and pop places! Thank you for forging ahead in these uncertain times.\n\nSo they have Avocado gelato.. I've learned that if something seems super weird/crazy on a menu that its always worth a try. If it was horrible its very unlikely it would be on the menu.. unless it was brand new.\n\nFlavors Sampled:\n\nAvocado:\nThe guy told me I wouldn't be sorry for trying it and he was right. The creamy/fatty flavor/texture of the avocado was a great pairing. Gelato is much lower in fat then regular ice cream so the added fat from the avocado didn't make it overly heavy. It was very smooth, creamy and refreshing.\n\nPeanut Butter:\nBy now those poor souls who actually read my novel like reviews know my love for peanut butter. This had an amazingly strong peanut flavor and was made with real peanut butter. I didn't ask which brand but I'm guessing it was not one filled with sugar. Was a very dark rich roasted peanut flavor verses the sugar bomb type we usually get in baked goods/sweets.\n\nStrawberry(no sugar added):\nHad a nice strong strawberry flavor but was a little overly sweet like most sucralose type products.\n\nMango:\nSuper strong mango flavor. There was no guessing what you were eating. Not sure how they got this much flavor from a natural product but I don't believe they use any artificial flavoring.\n\nI ended up getting half and half peanut butter/avocado.. and no I didn't mix them.. that would be weird even for me :P\n\nOne other cool thing I noticed was a topping they had. The Costco peanut butter filled pretzels. Imagine how tasty that would be with some peanut butter ice cream or chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.. YUM!\n\nOne thing they had going that gelato spot and many of the others don't is the large size selection. There were 5 or so different sizes and ALL sizes including the smallest could be mixed. Most have a large and a small and will only do a single flavor in the small. I like that you can get as much product as you want.. cuts down on waste and probable overeating."
4,"This company is honest and fast,good job and especially Jamie is so friendly to communicate,I don't know the ohters,but I will keep using them for my garage door service."
0,"**Summary**\n       - Incompetent staff - Half of them don't know the obfuscated procedures the other half enforce to make it difficult on the customer and waste time.\n       - Availability - They randomly have no doctor in for a day. How are you going to have an optometrist location without a doctor?\n       - Pressure - They try to push the brand of contacts that will give them their commission and make it terribly difficult for you to get the one you want.\n       - Price - With insurance, their fitting prices are about $20 more than their competitors.\n**Story**\n\nOne Saturday, my usual optometrist was booked solid and I was in great need of new contacts, so I gave Elite Eye Care a try. Big mistake. I came in looking for a contact lense prescription for my current brand and a glasses prescription in case I wanted to get new glasses later. After taking the exam, they \""forgot\"" to write me a glasses prescription. I mentioned it and they apologized. Tricky tricky.\n\nThe next week I'm trying to buy my contact lenses at Sam's Club and they told me the contact lense prescription was for Acuvue 2 and not my current brand. Well played Elite Eye Care. Well played. I call Elite Eye Care up to tell them I wanted my current brand and they told me they just have to fax over a release form for me to sign and send back. I did that and due to their slow response time, it took an hour. Guess what, they sent over the exact same Acuvue 2 prescription even though I specifically told them that was the problem. I called them again and they changed their story. They now told me I have to come in and get \""refitted.\"" Unfortunately, because they wasted an hour, they were closing and I couldn't do it that day. I told them I'd come in next Saturday, and they told me it'd be fine since the \""refitting\"" would only take a second.\n\nNext Saturday, I come in and they tell me there's no doctor in. At this point the trial lenses they gave me is past due, so I gave in and bought Acuvue 2. Unfortunately, I let them win.\n\n**Recommendations**\n       - I would definitely not recommend this place unless frustration and inconvenience brings you joy."
0,"Food is microwave. Rice is hard as rock. They served me the wrong plate, I was eating thinking this is not what I expected yet it's ok and I'm hungry. Food runner then comes back and has a bit of an attitude, takes my plate and brings the correct one. \nPlate was scorching hot one second and dead cold the next. Friggin microwave. \n\nDid not finish my plate. Did not enjoy the food not the service. Lousy option at the airport. Won't be back again."
4,Fantastic food. The Sharma wrap was amazing.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean.
4,"Grabbed some take-out on my way home today... got a foot-long French Dip (which at this place is kinda like a Philly, but without onions or peppers) and some chips... would've got some fries, but i didn't want to risk them losing their crisp on the way home.\n\nFirst off, this location has been a few other restaurants over the last few years, and I liked all of them - which on one hand is great because it's so close, but on the other hand is a bummer because it's a bit of a hidden spot so I guess in the past these restaurants didn't get enough business to stay open. Hopefully that won't be the case here. \n\nHad a chat with the guys working there, and it turns out the place is run by locals who grew up here like I did. We talked about the old days of Video Roundup and other stuff in the area that isn't around anymore. They seem like great guys, so I hope this place does well.\n\nAnyway - I almost couldn't keep myself from attacking the bag on my way home as the smells coming from the container and filling up my car were intoxicating - also I was starving. When I got it home and tore it open, I was faced with two beautiful giant sandwiches... Holy shit. The bread was a 12\"" roll which ended up getting cut in half, but each half was stuffed with enough meat to probably fill the whole roll.\n\nChallenge accepted.\n\nI was pretty full after the first half, but I powered down the second half... but I didn't quite finish off the bag of chips... full-size bag by the way. Usually places give you tiny snack size bags, but they gave me a big grab size or whatever it is. Anyway - not only was it a ton of food, but it was awesome as well. Every bite was joy. I'm totally ordering from them again... and again... and again. They deliver, so I'm pretty excited about that. Even though they're like walking distance from me, I just like being able to summon food."
2,"It is a Dunkin Donuts...so it's hard to criticize...because it's a Dunkin Donuts. I have been there many times, so I can base this off multiple visits. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is mainly due to the addition of a new tv in the dining room. When I went last Sunday,  I was like oh a tv, that's nice...then I realized it was tuned in to Joel Osteen.  I find him insufferable.  Really hard to enjoy breakfast with my son, while Osteen is talking.  Why not ESPN, CNN, or Phineas and Ferb? It was very annoying.  \n\nAs far as service.  In the morning, they prioritize the drive thru.  It's not uncommon for 6+ people to be in line at a time. They will have several staff members working in back on drive thru with one person at front register,  which would be fine, except they seem to put newbies on that register.  They are usually slower and get thrown off by the simplest request.  I asked if I could sub chocolate milk for coffee. He had to go ask a supervisor,  while 5 people waited behind me. They do have several very nice, helpful employees though.\n\nThe coffee hits the spot and donuts are good.  Love the Boston creme."
4,best pool party ever!\n\n- drunk at 2 pm = typical Vegas.\n- food + alcohol + no wait for ladies room ( in the cabana area ) .\n- great house music!\n- Met a cutie got us free cabana + unlimited drinks/food. o yahhhhhhhhh!
2,"Lines are long... long...long... and I was there on a week day. Also a little bit miffed at the fact they wouldn't honor my discount code at the gate. Was unable to purchase online ticks right there on my phone because it takes \""several hours\"" to get the info to will call. It's 2013 ladies! As many as 3 major slides all shut down at one time. We did have fun though. Thank goodness only me and my oldest went this time. The lines would have been too much! Play ground/splash park is the best I have ever seen!"
2,"Although a trifle underwhelming, you're not going to go too far wrong at The Clock. Dishes are to a good standard, and the welcome is friendly. Reliable, if unspectacular.\n\nOverall, we said: \""The Clock is really pretty smart, continues to be very popular, and is a good lunchtime stop. Its offerings didn't unduly quicken my pulse, but they provided good wholesome fare, and, with the warmth of the welcome, set me on my way with a smile upon my face.\"""
0,"Horrible place! We walked in to this restaurant without being greeted stood where there for three to five minutes while 4 hostess / greeters were talking amongst themselves ignoring customers I asked one girl where do we put our names down on the list to eat . She stood there staring at me  and then I asked her if she spoke English ? She replied \""no\"" . We ended with walking out the door . I hope the one in Phoenix treats there customers better !"
1,"The quick and easy breakfast burrito (that I'm accustomed to getting at the old location) was anything but that yesterday morning when I went here to grab 4 burritos for co-workers and I.\n\nIt should have been a sign telling me to leave when I walked in and a woman was upset because she called in her order 20 mins prior and when she arrived they had not started it yet even though she was told on the phone it would be 10-15 mins.\n\nConsidering I was ordering for more than myself (didn't want to disappoint friends when they thought they were getting La Canasta and I showed up with a breakfast jack instead), I stayed.  \n\n25+mins later my order was called out and I asked if I could have hot sauce please.  I was then told \""they in there\"" so of course I looked and I found 2 small containers...for 4 burritos.  I'm close with my co-workers but not that close that we need to share 2 hot sauces for 4 burritos.  When I asked for me she told they charged for extra and then gave me two more (which I did not and would not have paid for).\n\nI would give this a 1 star, but nonetheless...the food is still decent."
4,"Total classic vegas, while it isn't our first choice (our normal hotel wanted $200 a night, I've stayed there a lot - it's not worth it) I decided to give it a shot since I knew exactly where it was. Being so close to the end of Fremont St by the stage, our room was very loud but, it's understandable down here. I'm really pleasantly surprised at how clean our room is! \n\nWe ate dinner at hash house which is an absolute must - the basic is the best! For much cheaper than we usually pay at another hotel on Fremont street it is 100% worth it. The staff was fantastic, especially Ashley at the players club desk!!"
1,"After all the hype I've heard about Pink's, it does not live up to it's raves. Maybe the LA joint is better so I may give it a second chance when I'm in LA, but don't try Pink's in Vegas.\nI got the Chili Dog, and my friend got the Pastrami Dog. The chili on my hot dog was very questionable, kinda like elementary school lunch chili what the hell kinda meat is in here but I don't care because I'm 7? kinda chili. Mushy and questionable. The dog itself? I think I've tasted better microwaving ones from the grocery store. It's bland, and just soft.\nDidn't try my friend's pastrami hot dog, but he said it just tasted like what it looks like. We also got onion rings-- after a few of them, you might want to food coma.\n\nI am all for greasy, fat food, but Pink's does not do it for me."
2,"Ended up here on saturday bc we wanted to go to Ranch 99 but were starving and i was craving korean bbq.  The place is  nicely decorated and the staff is very friendly. We ordered the Bulgogi and the seafood soup.  \n\nThe seafood soup  had all kinds of seafood, crab, giant shrimp, squid, etc. It was very tender, flavorful, and spicy.   \n\nThe waiter informed us that  bc we are only ordering one grilled dish  that they cook it in the kitchen.  That was fine with us less work and  the food was cooked better than i could have.   The Bulgogi was  super yummy and i loved all the side dishes that it came with.  Shockingly  my favorite was the  fish cake, normally i am not a fan.  But we couldnt stop eating it.   \n\nMother's is expensive for  korean bbq but the bulgogi was super yummy and i would come back again for it."
2,"I would recommend the lobster and the John Dory. I always love the amuse bouche that is presented, and the different sauces that are offered with the oysters. I don't like the fact that if you bring your own bottle of champagne they put it in the back for you at all times, don't offer you a chiller for it. I was allowed a bottle of Crystal and I assumed it would be placed in a bucket of ice beside my table at the time of my meal like I have seen with the one that are placed on an ice bucket with a holder next to the table. My bottle of Crystal was kept in the back, and it pissed me off when I told the waiter you should try this vintage, it's awesome. He told me I already tried some of yours in the back. I was really pissed, but dinner was comp'd because I gamble a lot. The food is well presented and the quality is of the highest. On one occasion when I was having clams, I got a mouth full of sand and it was disgusting."
0,"I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation.\n\nThere are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all."
2,"i came here to eat an early dinner with a buncha steak lovers.  i didnt have the steaks instead i had a pretty good salad and a side of mashed potatoes it was good! the others loved their steak! the prices were fair for a vegas dinner, there was a trio-combo which was priced perfectly and it came with plenty of food! ill def recommend this place to anyone who wants a quality, intimate meal. reservation and the wait were not a hassle at all! =)"
4,Precision did a great job on my daughter's car. It's been 2 months since installation and there are no marks or bubbles. Great customer service!
3,"Huge portions for a good price! :) Ordered the chicken and waffles, as well as the salmon benedict. The food came pretty fast and the presentation was so pretty.\n\nFour girls shared two large orders and it was good to fill us all up :)\n\nWIll be back to check out other items off their menu."
1,"My cousin and I went here for the first time today. We had wanted Sprinkles but Gigi's is just down the street from my place so we decided to go ahead and check it out. We got the Margarita cupcake, chocolate salted caramel and miss princess. \n\nThe Margarita cupcake was pretty disappointing. Both my cousin and I had gotten one. It tasted more like a yellow cake with lime frosting. Not to mention that the frosting was rolled in sugar, we had assumed that out would be salt, but were displeased when we bit into it and it was sugar. The cupcake was topped with a candy lime slice that I think was tequila infused but my cousin couldn't taste it. overall: the cupcake was way too sweet, and absolutely mundane & bland tasting."
0,"I have to agree with Shoe K.   Please don't waste your time patronizing this place.  \""All-you-can eat\"", yeah right.  More like, \""All you can eat, as long as it's not uni, ikura, hamachi, ama ebi etc.\""  This was a go to spot my buddies and I would hit up while in Vegas, but after our last visit, forget it.  The service was horrible.  I can't stress that enough.  We only received our first order of sushi (which included the aforementioned uni, ikura, hamachi etc.), and after a subsequent similar order, we did not receive.  Waiters continually asking if someone had taken our order, or the kitchen is being cleaned, again if someone had taken our order, on and on.  Total BS."
4,"I have seen Dr. Wills about 2 months ago and finally had the time to post the review. We moved to Las Vegas from LA and it took me a whole 2 years to finally find a dentist I like and trust... My co-worker recommend Dr Wills since she used him before. I called Dr. Wills with an urgent matter. My tooth was killing me. Even though they were fully booked, they made every attempt to fit me in, for which I'm extremely thankful. I absolutely loved their online check-in, saved me so my time! When I came in it was all ready, all I had to do is sign. The office staff and the hygienist were absolutely amazing. Friendly, professional, and gentle . From the time I came in to the time I was sitted in the chair, the wait time was only about 10 minutes! Dr. Wills gained my trust almost instantly. Professional, gentle, knowledge, and with extensive medical background (not just dental). I had to have the tooth extraction and Dr Wills warned me that the tooth was infected and the anesthetic will not be that effective until. I was not willing to wait a week until I complete the antibiotic. Dr. Wills agreed to perform the extraction on the spot since he had a \""few tricks up his sleeve\"". And it did work! I was not in pain, just the pulling and tugging. It was finished so quickly! He prescribed antibiotics and pain meds, which I only needed for the first 2 days. I don't have dental insurance, so the cash price was very reasonable. Bottom line is I absolutely loved Dr. Wills and his staff. I will be bringing my whole family here for all of our dental needs and recommend it to whoever is looking for a great dentist!"
4,Me and my husband stayed at the Aria resort on my birthday for the first time. We loved it. It is absolutely beautiful and clean. It is expensive but you get what you pay for.
3,"My youth is over.  S'allright as a dance club but sooooo many young people a little tooooo happy bumping and grinding on anything making me realize that that phase of my life is gone gone gone.  On the other hand, having a committed relationship does have its perks.  The waterfall is really lovely and the dancing golden girls are fun to watch...."
1,"They have been in buisness long enough now to get it right and still they fail.  The food is still pretty blah and doesn't come out they way it is described on the menu.  Twice now they have rung up the wrong price for things I've ordered and the service is basic but nothing great.  Still, eat here if your starving and don't want to eat at the buffet but if you have better options, I'd recommend choosing elsewhere."
4,they had given me the wrong dressing for my salad and i work in a very busy call center i was really mad i SPECIALLY told her what salad dressing i needed and when my co-woker brought it back it was wrong!!! im not going lie i was mad only because i was sooooooooooo freakn hungry and it was 4pm and i was on my last brain cell lol the manager talked to me and they brought me my dressing i only work 1minute away thank goodness and they gave me cookies who doesn't like cookies!!!i was soo happy after top notch service i love them seriously i do!!! best manager took care of the situation swiftly and professionally i wish i caught her name but like i said i was on my last brain cell lol im glad she is the manager she is amazing! and thanks to chris who brought my dressing and was so sweet about it!!!

2,"I really want to love this place... \n\nThey really need more hot food on the menu. The desserts are limited and standard at best. And it is a good walk from the rest of the uptown area. Went on a slow Sunday right at opening. Rex took good care of us but really needed to give space. Asking \""how are we doing?\"" every 5-10 min just gets old. \n\nA good overhaul of their wine list would be a good start. Followed closely by fixing the overly dry cupcakes. Good, but dry. Ask for a glass of milk next time I suppose. \n\nCrave could be great just needs a little nudge to get there"
0,"Wow, in contrast to all the great restaurants and pubs in Montreal, this was the pits.  Service was very efficient, until we finished our meal and our waitress disappeared for the next 20 minutes.  The blonde beer was horrible, almost a sweet and sour taste at the same time.  My wife and I challenged each other to take a swig without wincing and we couldn't pull it off.  I have tried many beers and enjoy microbrews but this was horrible.  Then we noticed a waitress taking the dirty silverware that was collected from the tables, putting them in a pitcher which I assume was slightly soapy water, wiping them off with a towel and putting them back in a tray as clean.  This was not in the kitchen, but on a side table and no rinsing.  The music from the pop videos was so loud, you had to shout to have a conversation, and it was all rap and pop crap.  Overall a really bad experience.  If you want a good pub, try Ye Olde Orchard Pub, great food and service and good selection of beers, both Irish and local."
2,"I'm feeling like adding stars...well, it's also because I'm a follower of Nobu, sushi chef. He was working at Cyro's and now has transitioned to Pisces.\n\nI'm glad Pisces added Nobu to their staff. The place was busy on a late Thursday evening: good energy, great sushi. \n\nThe bartender was friendly and even shared a special mixed green tea drink for us to try. \n\nNice job, Pisces...I'll be back..."
4,"The Valley of the Sun JCC is truly a community center.  It offers so much for any age!  From the physical activities, lectures, classes, cafe, library, social events, book fairs, school, basketball and racquetball courts to the comfortable atmosphere to just relax and visit. The upstairs gym is fully equipped and clean and pool is gorgeous.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It is always one of the happiest places to visit!"
0,"They \""tunneled\"" us from the airport to The Excalibur hotel. Our cab fare was supposed to be less than $20, instead it's $26. Lesson learned and always make sure \""no tunnel\"" or \""no freeway\"" because these days cab drivers in Vegas are money hungry and don't care about rules and regulations.\n\nLV taxi authority...what you gonna do about it?"
0,"Had some problem with my iPhone, called in the these\""amazing, life saving guys\"", got the quote and rushed to their office just to find out that I'll be charge 30 bucks more!\nNot such a big issue, but I saw that it wasn't just me, most of the customers were a \""little bit\"" confused about the prices being changed.\nFelt like they're playing catch the big fish.\nNow about the technical details\nThe screen on my iPhone 4 is a little bit elevated from the frame(there's a gap between) and the feeling when scrolling it's not even close to the original, though the guys told me they're working only with original parts!\nWhen they removed the cracked screen they must have touched something because right now the I hear the people (when talking on the phone,) very poor and the sound is \""cracked like\"", also the sensor that is actually shutting the screen off when you're talking on the phone is not working at all!\nI asked them on the phone why there is the gap and they didn't know what to tell me!\nI asked them why the phone is not turning off when is close to my ear and they told me that's a different story and they can repair it for me for another $50!\nmy question is why they didn't check the phone is working properly while they still had it?They're advertising working with genuine Apple parts, but it's just a lie to bring people in!\nAnother thing is they will charge you extra if you want the device fixed straight away, if you don't want to leave your phone in there for 3-4 hours!\n\nThey're advertising \""life-time warranty\"", but I didn't get the replacement when I told them about my problem, they wanted to charge me \"" just for the labor\"", like $30 something!\nWas it my fault their \""original Apple\"" screen didn't fit perfectly on my phone?I don't think so!\nSo, make sure you're asking the right questions when you're calling these guys and ask even more questions when you're handing the phone to them and after make sure the phone is working as it used to prior to the repair!\nHope this will help someone not falling in a little \""scam\"" repair!\nP.S.Since I saw 2 other customers unsatisfied while I was in their office, I guess these reviews are written down by the staff in there(or maybe their relatives)?"
1,"Went there this last Friday, as that's my \""breakfast out\"" morning.   Thought I'd give it a try.   The former restaurant (Blue Plate Brunchery) in this location was just \""ok.\""    This isn't much better.    Eggs were ok, and it's hard to blow it on toast, but the bacon was so overdone that I thought it had to have been sitting under a warmer for quite awhile, and the potatoes were dry and I think \""out of a bag\"" from some frozen pre-cut brand.    The plates are WAY too small, and everytime you tried to get a fork-full of potatoes they slid off the plate.    Coffee was burnt - tasted worse then the overcooked Starbucks brand.    Back to Village Inn for me."
4,"I honestly get annoyed when I hear people comparing Hakkasan to other clubs such as XS. They're two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT concepts. Get that straight.\n\nI love Hakkasan. They truly redefine the new meaning of luxury. Every execution of this club was well thought of from the design, to the dresses the cocktail servers wear, to the DJs they end up signing as their residents.\n\nYou do taste nothing short of chic and glamour once you step in. Yeah, it's dark with a lot of stairs but there are also elevators if you're not impatient to wait for it.\n\nAnd yes. It can be packed. Sardine style. But what club isn't when you have people like Calvin Harris or Hardwell spinning all night? Quit complaining since there are people that weren't fortunate to even get in.\n\nI'm still a firm believer that it's not the place, but the people that makes it fun. And if you had a horrible experience, reconsider going with different people that are willing to have a good time regardless of what the situation might be."
1,"I ordered the chicken Philly cheese steak and it came with the works but was lacking taste.  I am still trying to figure out what could have made that sandwich better.  The fries are hand cut, so that is a plus for some people, but not me.  (I prefer Steak Fries).\n\nEverything is made fresh to order so it has the potential of being a great spot in the Venetian hotel, but I just wasn't impressed with the overpriced sandwich and no-salt fries."
0,Beauty is only skin deep. Conn's service/repair facility is horrible to deal with and the salesman that sold us an extended warranty for a laptop lied about having to send a defective item in for service. We were told we could exchange the laptop for a new one if it failed and that's isn't what happened. They have had the laptop for 9 days and counting and haven't even looked at it yet.
1,"My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7.  We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer.  We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM.  After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!).  We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts.  We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk.  A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner.  She started to say \""Oh I\""m sorry but we...\""  At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \""be nice\"".  She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated.  Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot.  I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu.  We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated.  The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing.  We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta.  The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths.  There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were.  The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed.  While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again.  I myself have experienced true Italian hospitality, unfortunately it was nowhere to be found at Giada."
1,By the looks of it this place is under new management. As a result the range of drinks stocked is less comprehensive than it used to be and the decor's gone rather minimalist & sterile. Not sure that the bistro is any longer vegetarian either.
3,The pizza is decent for the price. Love their Monday 50% off every pizza....can't beat that deal. The garlic knots are awesome and reasonably priced too.
4,"Living in Scottsdale I didn't find a need to go 30 miles to get the Civic fixed. But looking at all the 5 star reviews on yelp  my friend insisted.\nThe experience was pleasant but what made it FANTASTIC  was when he(Tait?)  explains the problem in detail( which was a detached bumper) , what he did to fix it and then ASKS us  \""IS IT OKAY IF I CHARGE YOU 35$ FOR THAT?\"" \nwhoa! It's hard for me to recollect a time when a business/vendor/workshop asked me such a question....\nThat should speak loads about the kind of service you get at this place...\n\nNot to mention he suggested us checking an axle issue with the honda dealer considering it might be covered under warranty...another workshop i inquired at asked me to cough up 300$  to get it fixed\n\nAll in all this place is well worth the 5 stars!"
2,"Stayed here for my little Mother's day mini vacation. The hotel is only 4 years old so everything is fairly new and clean.  Because it is off the strip (about 15 minutes away), the air quality is better therefore much more children friendly than most hotels on the strip. \n\nThe layout of the hotel was a bit confusing. Alot of the first-time guests, including ourselves, found our way up to the casino/room elevators instead of the lobby to check in. Remember to ask for a room closer to the elevator otherwise it is a looooooooooong walk each day to get to/from the room. As far as strip view v. canyon view, doesn't matter...it's blocked by the hotel parking structure. \n\nThe standard room was a bit small but the bathroom was really nice. Large marble tub which my daughter enjoyed. Built-in small TV near the tub however, really loud bath faucet! It's obnoxiously loud when filling the tub. \n\nThe maintenance crew were wonderful. They were courteous even just passing by the hallway. It's the front desk check-in group that were the frowny bunch. \n\nGood choices of pricey restaurants as well as food court fast foods and decent buffet. KidQuest play-area to let your children burn off some steam while you gamble their college funds away.  Movie theater, bowling alley, awesome pool for kids and arcade area as well. But if you want to do some shopping, there is not much of that. There are a couple of shops on the casino level of the hotel but nothing impressive. \n\nPro: Off the strip, great staff, excellent pool.\n\nCon: Confusing hotel layout, long walk way to elevators to/from room, loud faucet."
4,"Mon amour Madhouse Coffee!!!  I never thought I would experience the taste of an authentic French Croissant again after eating one every day when living in Paris.  And then one day I stumbled into this coffee shop and was transported back in time.  Since that first magical encounter they impressed me with their Italian panini and lately with their figure friendly panna cotta.  The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly and the coffee is great.  I love to bring my golden retriever and relax 24/7.  Keep up the good job!!!!!"
4,"We were visiting the area for vacation when my son spotted this store.  We went in without any intent to purchase, to just look around.   2 hours later, as my preteen son tried every violin in the shop, the staff was still very friendly and patient with us.  In the end we made a purchase for a more advanced violin with coda bow and outfit and one happy kid as we made our way back to Northern CA with it.\n\nLater research showed we got a fair deal on a great sounding violin, very durable case, and upgraded bow.  Two years later, he's still playing on it happily."
1,"Overpriced/small portions/mediocre food! The food was pretty heavy handed on the spiciness. Not a problem for me, but the people I went with were not expecting it. There was a long wait considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Not worth it, I don't plan on ever coming back. Though it is BEAUTIFULLY decorated... The decorations must be figured into the price."
2,"BEAUTIFUL club! The place looks amazing! Drinks are typical vegas prices: overpriced. Couple of different dancefloors and if they open up tao beach at night, definitely check it out! Is it just me or is the crowd here always really Asian? Maybe it's because I'm Asian and I notice but I swear every time I come here its flooded with Asians!!! Real talk. I heart Asians but I prefer a more diverse crowd. Nonetheless, Tao is still a great club to hit up in Vegas for a good time!"
0,"Really? A free standing UPS store and you can't handle accounts nor carry shipping labels... This is not the only UPS store that doesn't do it either which is really frustrating... They refer me to go home and do it from my computer, it makes no sense why the store can't have the capabilities to do so."
0,"Wow, I had NO idea I wasn't the only uncomplaining person till I just looked at the bad reviews right now...plenty of p.o.'d people out there, Danny's.\nWell, I am stuck with about 8 tickets for free basic washes here, and when they are used up I am going to seek out another way to go than the local Danny's.\nLooks like when they got rid of the illegals that used to clean here, the business went down like crazy.  Used to get smiling faces and a clean, undamaged car back when I had it washed here but looks like that ended some time ago.\n\nBIG COMPLAINT....altho the Manager said to come back and they would actually clean the car this time (I think I'm too disgusted to even come back in there right now...):\nI did learn one thing from having my car washed--and the windows, dashboard and interior not even touched--is don't call and file a complaint with the Manager, Roger.  I NEVER complain, but there were fingerprint smudge marks on the windshield--which should be a basic to clean--when I came in and when I drove out of there!!!! \nSo, I called just to give the Manager a heads-up and maybe he should check the guy who cleaned my interior (he knew who he was right away), and this fool, Roger the Manager, tells me the guy that I spotted as the bad cleaner had a \""huge following\"" and does such splendid work and had been with them a long time.  Does he really think I am going to believe this b.s.?  Who has a \""following\"" as a guy who works on an assembly line at a carwash?\nPLUS, this is the only guy I EVER saw at Danny's who actually counted the bills I gave him as a tip when I handed them to him.  Nobody ever did that before, which tells me he just pretends to clean and collects tips all day....and Roger at Danny's lets him do it, obviously.\nThe counter girl is nice and helpful, but she is working for a flim flam Manager and the cleaner out front with the \""huge following\"" totally is uncaring and incompetent.\nRoger, I was in sales and sales management for 35 years.  Do you really think you can bullshit the Old Bullshitter?  I almost gagged on the phone with the crap you were trying to feed me.  Did you think because I am a Senior and a woman that I would buy that load?\nReally, really, really disgusted with Danny's--and it used to be my go-to place.\nAgain, when I finally rid myself of the 8 or so tickets for a free basic wash I bought they will never see my face again unless there are some major changes there.  Sad to see you go, Danny's, but you really deserve it with this kind of service."
3,"Had the salad special, the duck and the souther julip.  Bartender was really good.  They do not have draft beer, but they do offer craft beer in bottles and cans.\n\nThe salad special was really tasty; all ingredients were super fresh and complemented each other very well.\n\nThe duck was good, but the portion/slices were too big/thick for my tastes after having the salad and bread, but that's probably more specific to me than others.  My compatriots had the scallops which looked amazing.\n\nService was fine.  I kind of wish I had ordered the chicken instead, as I've heard amazing things about it, but I couldn't see how that baby would fit with everything else I'd consumed that day.  It looked GOOD from what I saw at other people's table's though!"
3,I love Bambino's. It is within walking distance from my place and they have a great $16 special-lg cheese pizza and wings. \n\nIt's not world's greatest pizza ever but it definitely gets the job done.Check them out.
4,"The Gladly doesn't officially open until this Saturday but they had a preview night for people (like myself) who work in the area.  Taking over in the spot that Ruth Chris used to occupy, I am looking forward to eating there often.  \n\nOf the small plates that they were serving, my favorites were the scallops and the duck.  Both were fantastic.  The one dish that I wasn't able to sample because it was grabbed almost as soon as it came out of the kitchen was the meatloaf.  Everyone that I talked to that tried it said it was the best dish that they tasted.  I also had the tuna and the chicken pate.  Both were good, but not great.  \n\nAs for the drinks, I really enjoyed the Thai Margarita but once I tried their Manhattan, I was hooked.  It was by far the best Manhattan that I have ever had.  I also sampled the Salute, a gin and grapefruit drink, but didn't really care for it.  They had a number of other cocktails on the menu that they weren't serving that looked very good and I can't wait to go back and try a few.\n\nLastly, the service was just as good, if not better, than the food or the drinks.  The staff was very friendly and even though it was the first time I had ever been there, or anyone for that matter, I left feeling like a regular.\n\nI can't wait for the official opening so that I can come back and try the meatloaf and some of the other cocktails on the menu.  Seeing as how I work next door, I have a feeling that this is going to be my new go to spot after work!"
0,"This place was ridiculous! I payed almost thirty dollars for two tacos and a margerita...what the hell! AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, it wasnt even busy and our server took his sweet time taking our order and at one point I saw him come out, look at us,and went back and brought me my food which was edible but for the price I payed I could have gone to a regular taco stand and fed like 3 people with what I paid for two tacos! Then I had to wait almost half an hour for the bill which by the way I only got because the manager happened to walk by and asked if we needed something. Mediocre food, poor service, and really over priced for what you get."
1,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. \n\nI went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).\n\nThe presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2\""x 2\""-- a sad display. \n\nThe chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. \n\nThis was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! \n\nWe left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness."
0,"Please believe the reviews about security you read on here. They are awful. 2nd time that they have come up to my boyfriend asking \""to talk\"" outside. FYI, if you are ever asked this, finish your overpriced warm drink because you are not coming back. We hadn't even been there an hour. We were minding our own business, had stools at the bar, no falling/spilling/yelling, just trying to have a good time when my boyfriend was approached to \""talk outside\"" by 2 bouncers. I then told my friend with us to finish her drink because he's being kicked out. She's from out of town, totally thought I was being sarcastic, until she realized I was being dead serious. She was beyond floored. Once outside, the bouncers really had no valid reason as to why he was kicked out, but my personal favorite was \""you're a big guy\"". Will not be going back ever again and I make it a point to go out of my way and tell everyone I know to never go to this bar. Such arrogant, cocky, frat boys for security. Hopefully this places closes soon and a better bar opens up that actually lets people relax and have a few drinks, and maybe even actually dance! Such a shame because the Mesa location is fabulous."
4,I love the way she colors and cuts my hair. She's even Redkin color master certified.
1,"Haven't been to the one in NYC... But this one is, \""BLAH\"".\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate, their signature thingie majiggy that was in the movie... It basically tastes like powdered hot chocolate, like the ones I used to have as a kid, frozen... Then tossed into a blender when it's being served. My GF and I shared the regular sized one for $10... It was pretty rich but the massive amount of whipped cream assisted to tone it down.\n\nOther than this signature beverage, I wasn't really WOW'd by it. I guess it's just one of those things that you just have to try and see for yourself whether or not you're going to like it since there's so much hype over it. \n\nDecor was cute and we sat outside and had a view of the street. It was a little warm but the fans kinda helped move the hot air around LOL.\n\nReturn visit? Probably, I'd like to try the food but FHC will not be on my agenda the next time."
1,"Probably some of the least impressive rooms I've ever seen in Las Vegas. The casino and Paris vibe are decent, but not happy with the rest of my experience.\n\nThe rooms are standard hotel rooms. They must've decided not to carry the Paris theme into the rooms for some reason. And there seemed to be a lot of wear and tear in the rooms. The TVs are old and the remote hardly worked.\n\nThe worst part was the nickel and diming. They wouldn't let me check into my room a couple hours early without paying an extra $25. Wouldn't be so bad, except their check-in times were like 4pm. Also, internet is not free.\n\nI guess like everything in Vegas, the whole purpose is to get you there and then slowly take money away from you. For some reason I expected more from the Paris."
1,"When it comes to sushi, I have definitely had better. A group of friends and I came here on our lunch break. We work in one of the Glendale arenas, so it was a walking-distance option for lunch. \n\nFor the lunch crowd, Kabuki is extremely deserted. As are most other places at this time in Westgate. Despite the lack of a crowd, we were only allowed to sit at the sushi bar, which was a little awkward for a group of 6, considering you have to yell across the bar to withhold conversation... \n\nAnyhow, I'm not going to make this a novel of any sorts. I ordered one of their lunch specials, which was advertised to come with 6 nigiri pieces of sushi, a california roll, and a soup or salad. I asked my waitress if I could sub out the shrimp nigiri for salmon, and she said yes but for a dollar upcharge. I agreed... For $14.99, the portion could have been MUCH more generous. The California roll was small and came with 6 1-inch diameter rolls that were haphazardly put together. The nigiri was okay, but the tuna definitely was not the freshest it could have been. My miso soup that I ordered with the meal was good, but seemed to be overpowered with tofu chunks (about half of the soup was tofu). I also ordered a side of steamed rice, which was advertised at a dollar, but the waitress rang it in as sushi rice which was a dollar expensive and not what I ordered. Needless to say, I left hungry. \n\nThe quality of the sushi is alright at best. The portion size compared to price is laughable. Compared to other places I know that have similar lunch specials, I was disappointed to say the least. I really wanted to like Kabuki, but sadly, I do not."
0,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!! Someone broke into my room around 5am and stole a purse that was two feet from me. CREEPY!!! Woke up to someone slamming the door shut, walked to see and my door was cracked open. Scary to think someone was in my room while I was sleeping. Security came in and told me the door doesn't close unless you pull the knob up!!! Front desk never mentioned anything and there was no notice on the door! Security showed me how the door doesn't close!!!!!! If they know it is a problem, WHY NOT FIX IT!!!!! This IS NOT THE ONLY TIME either!! Scroll down to read other reviews!! I wish I would have!! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!! Seriously only rated to leave this to helpfully save others the fright and frustration......"
3,"Being from New Orleans I'm never ever impressed with \""cajun/creole\"" resturants outside of Louisiana. Going in my expectations were very low and I expected bland commercial cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The flavors were well developed. It wasnt just bland heavily spicy food. It has nothing on resturants in New Orleans. But generally places outside of the Boot don't. But I'd recommend it to a friend."
3,"Pros: Fantastic food, nice little patio, excellent cocktails, Good service.\nCharlotte needs more of this vibe.\n\nCons: if you go on a weekend night, it's CROWDED. Either get there early, or choose another spot to imbibe. Bar seating is first-come first serve and the tables are for diners only.\n\nMy suggestion? Go early on a weeknight to avoid the crowds. You won't be disappointed."
3,"For years now, I have been telling my boyfriend about my hopes and dreams in life.  One that kept coming up, time and time again, was that I wanted to hug a penguin someday.  I was resigned to the fact that this would never happen - where on earth would I possibly be able to hug a penguin?  Antarctica?  Not going there.  Zoos - yeah, they have gates separating me from the huggable waddlers.  So it was just another dream destined to never come true - until my 26th birthday when my boyfriend presented me with two tickets to the Penguin Encounter at the National Aviary.\n\nI was so childishly excited when we arrived at the Aviary one Saturday.  We were early for the penguin encounter, so we explored the rest of the Aviary first.  I was surprised at how delightful and interesting it was - yeah it's just birds, but like - who knew birds could be so cool?  It's essentially a zoo for birds, which sounds boring, but it is not!\n\nMy favorite part (besides the penguins) was going in the tropical habitat room.  This trainer gathered up a big crowd of us and did a feeding demonstration which was awesome.  Only kids got to be participants - well, it was an unspoken rule, but how dumb would I look standing up there with a bunch of 5 year olds - so that was a bummer.  But wow - watching these kids throw a grape in the air and this beautiful multicolored bird swoops down to catch it.  Birds were rushing past me so fast I felt a breeze by my ears.  The air was just buzzing with life, and the trainer was really knowledgeable and gave us a great, interactive show.\n\nWhen it was time for the Penguin Encounter, i was thrilled to hear that we were the only two signed up that day.  Technically as many as 8 people can do it at a time, and I would've been so furious if there were 6 dumb kids getting all up on my penguin time, but fortunately that was not the case.  We were brought to a classroom, and sat on some low benches close to the ground.  We heard some weird honking sounds coming from behind a partition.\n\nA few minutes later, a trainer (Chris, I think?) came in, and opened a door to a little cage where our new penguin friend Elvis had been hiding.  Apparently he had been honking to alert us to his presence, and perhaps to ascertain whether or not we were also penguins (nope).  Elvis waddled around us for a while, rather disinterested, but he LOVED his trainer.  He kept plummeting into Chris's lap in this really hilarious way, flapping his wings with the sheer delight of being so close to his buddy.  To keep him still, Chris had to put a hand on his beak, and then Elvis chilled out enough for us to be able to pet him.  He was feathery, not surprisingly, and a very cute little guy.  Whenever Chris let go of him, he'd just sort of wander around and sometimes start heading away from us until Chris would go \""hey!  where do you think you're going?\"" and he'd waddle back.  Chris told us lots about penguins while Elvis tolerated our attention.\n\nAfter a while, Chris put Elvis on a table and we got to take some pictures with him.  I still hadn't gotten my penguin hug, so at one point I moved in a little closer to Elvis and he sort of tried to beak my face, as if to say \""back it up lady, we just met!\""  Learned that penguins don't really like to be hugged, and they mostly just tolerate being petted (unless you are their beloved trainer).\n\nAfter the photo op, we went outside with Chris and watched him put Elvis back in the penguin enclosure.  We watched him swim around in a showoffy manner for a while before we left.  It was a SUPER cool thing to be one-on-one with a wild animal (and an adorable one at that), but sadly my dream of hugging a penguin is not yet realized.  But maybe I should stop wanting wild animals to be like house pets, and just be content that I got to pet him at all!\n\nSuper fun day - definitely recommend the Aviary in general, and the Penguin Connection if you are a fan of the silly creatures!"
2,"EDIT-Went again on 7/28/2013:\n\nOrdered the Chicken Bites and the Steak Salad. Really good plates. The sweet potato teeter tots were crunchy and delicious and the chicken bites were crispy. The steak in the salad was cooked well and yummy garnishes on top!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe dropped by for drinks while waiting for our reservation at Le Thai. Wanted to go to Gold Spike but it was too hot and too far. \n\nReally underwhelming in my opinion. The happy hour prices seemed great, $1 chips & salsa and $4 Dos Equis drafts! \n\nBut it ended up being half a handful of stale chips with a dinky container of canned salsa and a mini mason jar of XX. \n\nI guess you can't expect much with those kinds of prices, but I just hope their servings are larger when it isn't happy hour."
0,"The exterior of my car is still dirty after going to Mermaid.  I was tempted to turnaround and ask for them to wash the car again.  \nThe staff at mermaid does a half fast job drying off the car and cleaning the inside.  \n\nWith that said, I will continue to give my service to Octopus."
