2,"This is just an ok place to come for some edible food. The food is good, actually. The service, not so much. They are not necessarily mean, just slow. More often than not we have waited much too long after being seated for someone to come and ask our drink. After our drinks come, it seems they rarely get filled and it takes way too long for the server to return even to check on us. Meh."
4,"Flying in over the Strip at night, this new structure was the first thing I saw all lit up, I knew if it was open I had to go!\n\nLocated in the new shopping alley by the Linq, you can't miss this giant observation wheel at the end. There are a few automated ticket booths along the walls down the alley along with a physical building to purchase tickets. Its $24.95 each during the day and $34.95 after 6pm, along with taxes and processing fees. Kinda pricey, but I had never done anything like this before and was willing to pay.\n\nYou buy tickets for specific times, but as this is a new semi-pricey attraction we bought tickets for the time it was then and got on right away. In typical Vegas style, you pass a bar going up, which I highly recommend as you can take your drinks up with you.\n\nIn the line you are coerced into taking a picture in front of a green screen to be viewed after your trip around the wheel. You can tell they expect this to be a big attraction because the next room in line is a huge circular room with many twists and turns for a huge line, complete with funny informative videos.\n\nAnd finally you're up! there was no line still so we were immediately ushered into our pod along with the 6 other people in front of us. The wheel doesn't stop (unless you're disabled) but it goes pretty slow so it's an easy step.\n\nInside your pod is all windows for better viewing, along with some plastic red benches off to the sides to sit and sip on your drink if you so choose. I was super excited so I stood and enjoyed the view the whole 30 minute trip. Several TVs line the top of the pod, showing you where your pod is on the wheel, how many feet up you are, and the funny info guy telling you various facts occasionally. When he's not there, some hip tunes are.\n\nAs a person wary of heights, I got a tad nervous sometimes when I looked down, but overall is was a very smooth trip. You couldn't feel it moving at all! And the views are incredible! Tons of picture opportunities, mine was clicking away the whole time. You make friends with the strangers in your pod too, wanting to take pictures with your friends without your arm in it. We were lucky enough to go as the sunset around 6:30ish so we saw the daylight views and the nightlights on our round. \n\nBut sadly, this pleasure trip comes to an end. Again, it does not stop but getting off is just as easy as getting on. The path leads you down into a photo booth to purchase your pictures if you so desire that they took in line, with various scenic back drops. And then you are in the gift shop! Tons of shirts, cups, keychains, shot glasses, and even High Roller chap sticks galore!\n\nThis is definitely worth the money, I'd go more than once if I could!"
0,Went there tonight.\n\nWorst Sushi I have ever had.
4,"Fantastic Italian right across the street from the Hard Rock.  I have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and it was fabulous both times.  For lunch, my wife and I ordered the lunch specials and not only was the food excellent, it was a great deal.\n\nOn my most recent trip, I had an epic dinner with a friend of mine.  We split an antipasto and the carbonara, then we had the osso bucco.  It was really quite memorable.  To top it all off, they had live music and the service was great.  I will definitely make it a point to eat at Ferraro's whenever I am in Vegas!"
3,"Ok this place really surprise me... It's ridiculously  good!!!! uni is clean and sweet, yellow tail melts on your mouth so as the scallop and the sea bream, shishito peppers are delicious and beef tongue yummy, everything I ordered was  so good I can't complain"
3,"Club Cafe is great.  \n\nIt's small and cozy (which works for the type of shows they do) and it's got a great vibe.  The appetizers and drinks are all good and we were happy with the beer selection.  I was also impressed with how friendly and helpful the door staff and waitresses were.  The sound in Club Cafe really was good, especially for a small venue."
4,"I wasn't expecting much from this show - for many reasons... \n\nShows (like cards) bore me to tears and I'm happiest behind a big slot machine! I go to Vegas to gamble - all I do when I'm there is gamble. And eat occasionally. And drink constantly. \n\nI hosted a bachelor/bachelorette party and we decided to see a show as a group. Again, I wasn't expecting much and already had a get-away plan ready just in case I decided to fake sick - just to go throw my money away in a big slot machine!\n\nWrong! This show was amazing, kept us all laughing the whole time. I loved the sexiness, the sinfulness and the sheer playfulness.\n\nI will definitely see this again in a few years as I'm sure the show won't change much front month to month."
1,This Fry needs to stay on top of rotation of veggies. Again the Campari tomatoes on the vine were spoil only 1/2 day. These are expensive tomatoes you would think a couple days of being okay in the refrig. This is the 3rd time with these tomatoes from Frys. The food bill are high enough that the Fry's business should make sure that the customer gets top products for their dollars.
2,"Good solid place to go if you want to hang out with friends, drink a few beers and watch 5 different football games going on at once.  Service started out a little slow when but got better as the night went on. We stuck around for 7 hours and the server never seemed in a rush for us to leave, so you have to appreciate that since 7 hours is a long time to tie up seats.  She was also pretty nice when we tried splitting the bill between cards and cash; I know how much of a pain that can be and it was a Saturday to boot.\n\nI didn't eat but one of my friends did, and the lavosh looked pretty darn good.  Judging by the way he mowed through the entire thing, I'm going to say he thought it was pretty outstanding too. It was the buffalo chicken one.\n\nYeah, the place is noisy, and peanut shells are everywhere, but it's a sports bar and that's what you'd expect there.  They also have a great selection of beers, both on tap and bottled; I hate when I go somewhere and only have a couple choices of the same mediocre beers everyone has.\n\nAnd of course, if you're hungry, try the wings!"
2,"This place was surprisingly okay...  My boyfriend wanted a prime rib special before we left back for home and we saw this as we were driving on the strip.  He had the prime rib special which he said was pretty good, and was pretty full after eating.  With all the extras it came with: soup or salad, bread, and the meat with your choice of potato style, he left pretty full.  I on the other hand had the Patty Melt, with was pretty good as well.  We really wanted to go downtown to have the $7.95 prime rib special but this was good enough.  Check it out, if you get the chance..."
3,"This store is huge!  They have all the latest Nike gear.  I'm not much into Nike to be honest, but I did go because I wanted to  check out the new Pacquiao gear.  It turns out they had a flippin' shrine setup for him.  It was pretty dope!  I did find tons of new Manny stuff, but everything was really expensive.  They also had a limited edition hoodie that he actually wore to the weight in earlier today.  There was only 108 made and Niketown Las Vegas had 30 of them.  To make things fair, they handed out raffle tickets.  If you ticket was pulled, then you were able to make the purchase at $250.  Unfortunately, I didn't win.\n\nPros:\n *  Awesome collection of pretty much everything new.\n *  Nike ID where you can customer your own gear.\n *  Very organized store and super friendly staff that is open to helping you.\n *  Live DJ\n\nCons:\n * No reception in the store\n * A bit over priced, but I guess that's normal since it's the latest stuff.\n * I didn't win the raffle  =(\n\nTips:\n *  If you need help, feel free to ask any of the associates.  Everyone I interacted with was very nice and answered all my questions.\n \nOverall, I'd say it was a good experience.  I was there nearly two hours and the only thing I walked out with was picture ( default ).                   Team Pacquiao!!"
2,"The $7 Super Gyro pita is legit- delicious tzatziki sauce, crumbles of feta, and an ample portion of gyro meat all packed on a thick pita bread. Bit of miscommunication when ordering and fries were added on to my order, despite repeatedly saying I didn't want them. \n\nService is prompt, restaurant interior is old-school, docking a star for the menu- instead of scribbling over your line items in marker when you change prices. If you can afford the rent on Fremont Street, you can afford a new menu board every decade."
4,AZ burger is da way da go!!  staffs are amazing..
2,"This is my CVS of choice because its closest to my house. Everyone is really friendly here in the pharmacy. When you go inside the service does seem to be more prompt versus going through the drive thru. \nThe one main problem with this CVS is that it has a really really really weird smell when you enter the store. It almost makes me want to gag. Not sure what it is but i've smelled it every time i've entered the store. Otherwise, this is your standard CVS nothing fancy, but clean personable staff. As long as they don't put a CVS closer to my house.. i'll be back..!"
1,"This place will definitely try your patience, food is good enough, but yet slow. I guess made to order, maybe a tad overpriced, but it's a drive thru. Live about a mile away and cringe when the wife says \"" Let's get Sonic \"" cause I know what's in store. The reviews are right. Orders are consistently wrong, the wait times, all of it. Past 10 years have been back, maybe once a month. Like I said patience will be tested, check your order before you leave the window, I have returned many times to just wait in the line again. And have found I drive a lot crazier leaving there wondering what just happened, EVERY time"
1,"My meal here turned out to be a very odd experience.\n\nThe good: \nI was greeted and seated right away, a glass of water and menu were provided immediately.  The water was refilled expeditiously.\n\nWhile it didn't smell as fragrant as Pho Nhan did when I entered, it did smell good.  \n\nI saw a mix of Asians and others (including one not-too-polite redneck farmer who talked way too loud on his cell phone at the table) but enough of the former to feel this was a popular place for Vietnamese.  I wouldn't trust a pho place full of only white people.  Scary thought.\n\nThe eggrolls were delicious!  They were more garlicky than ones I've had in the past and it was that kind of garlic that you keep taking bites of and wanting more of.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the shell was crisp and delicately flaky, the dipping sauce was perfect.  I could have eaten a whole meal of just these.  \n\nThe bad:\nAfter being seated and provided water and menu I was summarily ignored for at least 15 minutes.  THIS I'm not used to.  Someone else would have left.  The waiter was sitting a a table in full view of me about four tables away and purposely did not make eye contact or walk by, much less come to my table.  What's the problem, Dude??\n\nWell, you know what, I can usually out-stubborn anybody, though thankfully don't often need to, so I decided to sit there till Hell froze over.  Eventually an older man came out to bring another table their food.  He saw me sitting there, hands politely folded on menu, smile on my face, obviously ready to order, snapped some orders at the younger guy, who then came over to take my order at long last.  I got the aforementioned eggrolls and a bowl of soup that included duck leg and bamboo.  My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish.  The guy checked with me if I wanted the one with bamboo and I said yes, but my antennae went up.  As he was leaving the table he hesitated and asked, \""You work over there?\"" Pointing to the west.  I told him no, I was visiting from San Diego because I had a new granddaughter.  He brightened up at that and was perfectly nice after, so I can only guess he thought I was someone else initially, someone not worthy of his attention.  Working where?\n\nAfter eating the delectable egg rolls and being extremely impressed, the large bowl of soup arrived and emitted such a putrid smell I didn't know if it was from the person serving it or the dish itself.  It honestly smelled like someone had pooped in it, or in their pants nearby.  I told myself not to let my imagination run wild, thinking of stories describing slaves who defecated in their owners food, ewww. I had gone through so much to get it that I didn't want to send it back.  As I took bites and spoonfuls I pretty much narrowed it down to the bamboo being the culprit causing the bad smell and taste.  And it was not inedible, just took some getting used to.  I kept telling myself I probably had just never eaten bamboo before and maybe it's an acquired taste like Limburger(sp?) cheese, or liver.  Whatever, I ate it and while I barely made it to my motel bathroom after leaving the restaurant (don't ask), I had no further  gastronomic problems from the food, and that could have been caused by eating exotic food after having nothing to eat all day.  If the food had been \""bad\"" I'm sure I would have reacted to it during the night or next day.\n\nI'm trying to talk myself into giving them three stars because those egg rolls were so good but the more I remember sitting there being purposely ignored, the more I acknowledge how impolite and unprofessional that was so I'm going to make it two stars.  Sorry guys, next time tend to your customers.  I eat out every day and this place is very near my motel so I would have loved to add it into my rotation of eateries."
0,Well I am not a fan of sprint to start of just customer service is not a big part of there picture.  :(
3,Call early ( noon- 1:00pm) to place a carry out order so you won't be disappointed!\nThey sell out early. Ribs and chicken are wonderfu! Both slaws are good too.
2,"I used to like it a lot more and frequented Maharani while I live downtown. I love their Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Grilled Fish, and various forms of curries, especially the lamb and beef. Their naan and house made mango ice-cream top my list of favorites too. \n\nHowever, on one occasion after a meal I felt super thirsty throughout the entire afternoon, and had to keep drinking water non-stop. Not the greatest feeling after a buffet. Since then I haven't been back for a while.\n\nRecently my lab had a craving for Indian buffet and they talked me into giving it another try. The food was good, but the feeling of addiction in the past didn't kick in. There are many others in the community, my friends included, who love Maharani. Personally I don't see myself going back in a (long) while. I know this is not going to be particularly helpful but I would suggest people to go once and decide for yourself if this is for you. And it will help too to go with an open mind and try the wide spread of food they have on offer. And if you do go I will be happy to hear any thoughts =)"
1,"I've been itching to go to FEZ for a long time based on all the other wonderful reviews. I drive by FEZ nearly every day as I work just down the street.  \n\nFinally went with a buddy of mine and I got razzed more than I'd like for picking out a sub-par place! That is factoring in the food and the service. I'd probably give 2.5, 3 stars for the food. I'd give 1.5 stars for the service.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, although the service would have suggested otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was very pleasant and personable, but the time that went by before we got refills or that my dining companion's DIET COKE was fixed to a regular coke took too long. Me not being a soda drink couldn't care less about diet vs. regular but I know, I know, you soda drinkers need to have it exactly as you're taste buds know. \n\nThe food: I already had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus.  I must  say I was extremely impressed with the taste of the kisra....actually...I would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch, for sure. But I would get it to go. I wouldn't come back on a lazy Sunday afternoon b/c although I'm being lazy, I don't want the service lazy.  On to my friend's lunch...he got the All-American Burger. To me, this should have come on a sesame seed bun, what's more American other than apple pie,right?  Now I understand the Mediterranean flair that is FEZ, but it just didn't seem right to call it All-American when it's more like half-American....and his salt and pepper fries were not even warm-ish. And they tasted reheated. boo.\n\nWe both decided this would maybe have been a better time had if we were there in the evening. I think we'll give it one more try at night and see if we don't enjoy it a little more.\n\nMaybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews, maybe we came at a bad time, maybe he ordered the wrong item. Maybe I'll give FEZ another shot....but I'm not in a hurry to do that right now."
0,I liked this place and gave it good review last year.  Their  featured Thanksgiving menu looked interesting but it was terrible.  The food was cold and had to be sent back twice for reheating.  The desert was yucky and ugly.  The waiter didn't seem surprised that the dishes were barely touched.  What makes it all the more galling is that the meal was $35 per person and we left hungry.  Horrible.  We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager and he said nothing.  Happy Thanksgiving---Not.
3,Old School Vegas Gem with a little something for everyone.  Lots of prank gifts and little trinkets.  You could easily spend an hour browsing around in here.  I found huge oversized sunglasses to send my nephews for their snowmen in Michigan.  Lots of tins with different flavored mints.  Some of the adult gag gifts are great.  Lots of junk~\n\nThey lose a star for some of their ridiculous prices and no public restroom.\n\nIf you don't visit the talking parrot here you are truly missing out.  If you can't find the bird...ask an employee to show you to him. : ) Parrot doesn't disappoint!
3,lots of high end name brand shops but pretty nice
1,"Short and sweet:\n\nStaff was very friendly.\n\nPhoenix Burger - fairly decent bar burger.  Nothing to write home about.\nColeslaw - inedible.  I don't know what their seasoning of choice is, but it was gross.\nSteak Fries - pretty decent version.\nPotato Salad - wanted to try it, but they were \""out.\""  Friday lunch, and you're out? Wow.\n\nAll in all, not planning a return trip unless nothing else is open.\n\nThey must sell a LOT of beer on weekends, though, because kegs and cases were being brought in by the hand-truck-load when we were there."
4,I stopped in with some coworkers after a round of mini golf. The store is a combination mini grocer and restaurant. Great friendly service. The food took about 20 minutes but was very good and in decent portions. I will definitely stop in again to try more menu items.
1,"I went on a Monday, mid morning, to clean some heavy duty items (like couch pillows). I had seen a previous review talking about the large capacity machines so I thought is try them out.  A lot of the regular machines were out of order. \n\nThere were only 2 of the washers there and once I out my money in and my soap, the machine wouldn't start, so the lady there had to help me switch machines. The attendant was very helpful the entire time I was there. I'm not a big fan of the money card to work the machines, plus the card machine charges you 50 cents for a new card purchase. \nThere were benches and chairs and the place has free wifi. The bathroom wasn't working and there no TVs or music, so come with your phone charged or a book or something. \nAlso, the carts don't go outside so you gotta be organized bringing your stuff and out. \nLarge machine is 7.15 a load, the medium machine was 5.99 and the dryers were 70 cents for a 20 min dry cycle."
3,"We have been going to Sam's Town for years and it got much better in the last couple of years with better restaurants and a revised floor layout. The slots pay pretty well, and the atmosphere is quite relaxed. It is pretty far off of the beaten path, and it is popular with the locals. It is not \""Trendy\"", is old school comfy.\nIf you are traveling in an RV, check out the park next door. I have heard it is very convenient and reasonably priced."
2,"Cute place. My boyfriend got my dog a bone shaped birthday cake from here with her name on it. Don't worry this is the first and only time we planned on celebrating her birthday like this just for fun. She also got a stuffed Pawda purse and his dog got a stuffed Ferrari car . Great selection of goodies for the dogs. \n\nI know it's a little much, but the dogs loved their cake and their toys.   :)"
2,"I had the loveboat which was just ok. Broth was over seasoned and flank steak tasteless. I was expecting a beautiful rich pork broth that can stand on its own, but had something that resembled pre packaged ramen. The prices are good, but like other reviews, portions are small, which is ok with me. Pork belly bun did not have pork belly, but rather roast pork ( shoulder?)  which did have a nice flavor/texture. My partner had street noodle #2, which tasted like someone poured a bottle of sweet chili sauce and tossed some fried shrimp on top. This place will probably do good because of near by college crowd, but for someone looking for a legit noodle place that resembles the likes of momofuku, don't bother. I personally like their other restaurant better, pusadee's garden."
3,As always I get my favorite dishes. Mongolian Beef and Chicken lettuce wraps! Service was great. Friendly but a little forgetful. But it is all good. I am full and happy!
0,"Horrible service and lousy food. I went 3 times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) thinking that it would get better, but each time got worse. Name tags on the food were not changed from brunch to dinner, so I had no idea what half the food was. Long lines just to get in and rude hostesses. Food was not being refilled fast enough to meet demand. Never again!"
2,"i have to say ive never had their pizza...but they have really really good subs and wedgies, both baked and usually delicious. im giving this place 3 stars b/c i have tried delivery from this place several times and it has always been a horrible experience. the first time the order was wrong and who ever the manager on duty was told me to bring my food back..and i said give me a break, basically we got into a shouting match for them not doing their job right. second time order was slightly wrong and i vowed never to eat ther again. third time, i know i shouldnt have ordered a third time, the food was good but not piping hot. the delivery took an hour and half. when the delivery driver got here she didnt have change and asked could she bring it back. this obviously set me over the edge. i will give the gal credit though b/c she came back with the change. all in all these three experiences have made me never want to order delivery again. next time ill just go to subway, its not as good but its not near as much hassel. hope this helps."
3,"This place will not let you down, food wise. The dishes are excellent and the tequila menu is outstanding. After a good pirate show, I like to dine at Isla's. TI as they call it now (formerly the family friendly, no reason to go inside because the pirate show is on the front lawn Treasure Island) is trying to change its image and along with Tangerine this place is the only other thing holding up the crutch. The ambiance is a little toned down for a Vegas place but that's refreshing on Night Two especially. The service though is less than stellar. Our server knew little about the menu and even less about serving. One fun thing though is they have a Tequilier (a Sommelier, but with an expertise in Tequila) She was superb and very well-educated. Even my friends who swore off tequila in college (due to the frequency of its partnership in less than desirable indiscretions) found ones that they liked and even paired well with the food we were having. I've known about this trend in Mexican \""Bistros\"" for a while but had yet to participate. Having survived my second round of pledging involving tequila I can now say that I have a new found love this time. I hated the stuff with all good reason the first time (the plastic bottle was guilty by association)!"
4,"I walk in this place and say \""PLEASE do not hand me a menu\"". I know it like the back of my hand.  I have been here several times over many years and cannot get enough of the \""new style sashimi\"".  I get the white fish and salmon, delish!  Very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. Now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  Melt in your mouth!  Next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  Chilean Seabass is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  Black Cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. It's done right!  And believe me, I make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.  So yeah, this is an expensive place to dine but I am never disappointed.  I am not a big portion person, if you are, you'd hate it or go broke here. I love the quality, care and presentation of every dish here.  Wine list is good and cocktails are imaginative.  Service is always good here and if you don't take my word about the aforementioned menu options, the wait staff is happy to recommend and explain the dishes in great detail."
2,"I'm a little surprised at the number of Crazy Mocha franchise locations in this city.  It's a nice place, but nothing special.  \n\nPostives: The Murray spot has lots going for it like big space with lots of tables, prime location, and free internet.  Also a nice selection of teas.  \n\nNegatives: I personally have had problems connecting with the network there, but no one else seems to (at least PC users don't seem to), so I won't generalize too much.  I can't imagine their espresso-based drinks or their brewed coffee could be that good just based on the machines they're using and their brewing technique--but, I don't know for sure.  Lastly, I've found their baristas to be always bored and dispassionate.  Not what I want to encounter at a coffee shop.\n\nOverall, A-OK."
0,"This has to be the worst shipping service in history. My third time in two months that I've paid for expedited shipping only to have to wait another day to get my merchandise. This is through Amazon when using their Prime service. Maybe there is just a single truck or something? Or maybe this is a bike messenger service? Whatever it is, they definitely do not have the customer in mind. \n\nAnother irritating thing is that when you go on Amazon to track your order, it shows that it is \""Out for Delivery\"" and that is it. The next day, the same thing. I called Amazon and they refunded my shipping and contacted the company to find out where my merchandise was...guess what...\n\n\""Out for delivery\"""
4,"It was my first time here and I'll be honest, I was skeptical. I have been a \""Boiling Crab\"" fan for many years and each time I've gone to other joints, I've been severely disappointed so I've stopped trying. \n\nOur friend Andy recommended this place and seeing that we were crashing at his place, I thought we should at least try it out.\n\nI ordered 1 pound of crawfish medium spicy with their special sauce, 1 order of dungeness crab legs and both were delicious! The sauce was just right, not too oily, had a great garlic flavor. I also ordered a piece of corn to sop up the sauce. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood!"
2,"This was a quaint old-world feel French restaurant, that provided good food.  It was a very warm night, and the patio was full so we opted to sit inside.  It was slightly uncomfortable without an open window nearby, but the ambiance was very nice with the dim lights and the excellent music selection, a mix of French and English classics -- the bartender was mouthing the words of several songs, right along with the music. The waitstaff was excellent, friendly, good-natured, and polite.\n\nAs others have said, the soup was bland, but my companions seemed to love their salads.  The foie gras was small, but good.  The boar medallions were also good, with potatoes and asparagus, but they came in a very rich sauce that was a little overpowering, although tasty.  I drank a lot of water that night.\n\nThe highlight of the dinner was the desserts,  The cr\u00eape \u00e1 l'orange was excellent, and the cheesecake was very large and very rich, with a raspberry jam-like consistency topping.  Both wonderful.  Additionally, I heard great things about the flan and the almond roll, though both were very small.  All in all, it was a good experience, but with so many options for good French cuisine, I'm sure I will try another restaurant next time I'm in the area."
0,"Terrible! This was probably the worst piano bar I've ever been in! The guys were ok that singing..but when the girls who I guess are twins came out and started singing the whole place died.  Their singing was atrocious!!! When the guys sang, the crowd was totally into it. These ladies were AWFUL! and the waitresses are not a sight to look at. The waitresses were awful. We kept getting passed up on numerous occasions and the bartenders weren't really any better. I will never go back!"
4,I have been a client at Addicted to Nails for years. Love Sheera and her creativity. I will be a client for life.
0,"Day and time of incident: Sunday, April 6, 2014 - 10:40am.\n\nI'll make it brief.. ordered food, 20 minutes later, still no food. Hungry, want to get on the road asap. Decided instead of arguing for food to get refund and head across the street to In N Out. (Should of been first choice, shot my own foot!) *sigh*\n\nNot exactly sure who is at fault here, whether management or employee.\n\n  Apparently this female employee did not have the competence to add up my order and refund my money.. maybe if she was a teenager, that would of been excusable.\n  As she was pushing buttons on the monitor and looking back and forth at my receipt, she started twitching and looked liked the monitor was a ticking time bomb from how fast she was going trying to disable it from blowing her into smithereens. After a few unfortunate attempts and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund, she jumped, panicked, starting speaking gibberish and then turned around and left to the back of the kitchen.\n\nExtremely disrespectful leaving us there and would say unprofessional of her but then again, not sure if her (just assuming) G.E.D or high school diploma even covered that term. Which then points to management and the kind of training they provide to their employees.\nPoor lady, sure do feel sorry for her. Supervisor gave me my refund, ate a delicious burger from In N Out, drove back to California.\n\nCustomer Service = ZERO stars.\n\nWords of Wisdom:Stay In School Kids and Get Good Grades."
1,"Don't come here to stay the night!\n\nI stayed here at this hotel this past weekend with a group of my old friends. Checked in when I arrived on Friday to a rude bitter fat lady who yelled \""what do I want!?\"" I told her I was checking in and she grabbed my driver's license out of my hand. After I paid and signed their card I request to get a room on the 9th floor of the north tower since my friends' rooms were on the 9th floor and she wanted to make a big scene asking me \""whats wrong with the fifth floor?\"" I told her that my friends that I came up there with were staying on that floor. She gave an horrible attitude and threw my card keys on the counter at me along with the receipt not saying anything to me. I took my keys and went up to my room.\n\nYes I did end up getting on the 9th floor so I was not complaining at the moment. The room was old and outdated but the king bed was comfy and nice. I was able to get a good rest on the bed. Also a plus was that the A/C ran perfect the whole time. It was not too cold and not too hot but just right. The problem though was that room smelled and looked old, the TV had only a few basic channels mostly news and infomercials on pills that help you take a dump. Another thing that went wrong that really angered me was that the ice machine on our floor was broken. So we had to take the elevator up to the 10th floor just to get a bucket of ice. However the elevators in the north tower ran very slow and there are only two of them. So most of the time I took the stairs. I waited seven minutes one time just to go up to 10 for ice!\n\nOn the last night of my stay I Iost one of my card keys while I was out with my friends at Circus Circus. The other one was in my room. I went to the front desk where another rude lady named Josefina yells: \""What do you want!?\"" Oh I'm sorry! Am I disturbing you from YOUR time or something!? I thought to myself. I told her my situation about the key and she simply told me to my face: These things don't come cheap honey!\"" Then slammed the copy key on the desk. I also noted to her that the ice machine did not work on my floor and she just told me to get ice from 8 or 10. Wow! Really? These people act like they work for the DMV! \n\nAnd that's not all. The next morning my friends and I requested late check out until 1pm for all rooms so I called the front desk and one of the clerks answered HELLO! I asked if this was the front desk and he shouts on the phone \""was is it that you want!?\"" I told him that I wanted to get late check out on my room. He told me it was until 1pm and I told him that's what I want. When my friends and I were walking downstairs to drop our luggage in the truck and get in our last gambling rush before going back on the road the cleaning lady asked me if I was checking out. I told her until one and she simply yells: \""Oh you too!? all of you making my job harder. Stupidos!\"" Seriously did she call us stupid in Spanish under her breath!? At that point I was pissed and ready to leave that place. One I made my final call from my room to check out the lady just simply hung up the phone on me so I had to call the desk again to make sure the check out went through. She picks up and yells \""Yeah! Yeah! You already called for that! I asked if it went through and she goes off: \""I already said yeah!\"" No you didn't You just hung up the phone in my face! I told her getting pissed off at all these people. \""Well, you're checked out and your total is $$$ so goodbye!\"" CLICK!\n\nGOOD RIDDANCE was more like it! Ever heard of a restaurant in Vegas called Dick's last resort? The place where the waiters and workers treat their customer's like crap? Well One would have thought that Dick's Last Resort owned the 4 Queens! Service was terrible from beginning to end. Its like the employees hate being there. Why not get another job then!? I gave this place two stars because of the comfortable bed and Air conditioner in my room. Plus they have a really good restaurant called Magnolia's which serves prime rib dinners for only $10 and that place is well worth it. They are lucky to even get two stars out of me. The idea to have to up or down a floor to get ice is outrageously appalling! If you do stop at 4 Queens on Fremont St. go there to gamble and to try out their restaurant Magnolia's, but never go there to stay the night! I won't be coming back!"
2,"I love how you can build your own burger! It reminds me of a place called The Counter in LA...same concept but different items on the menu.\n\nSo my friend and I shared the kobe beef burger with grilled onions, sauted button mushrooms, and provolone cheese all on a whole wheat bun. The meat was cooked medium rare and it was the best burger I've had! It was so juicy and flavorful! \n\nOh and the sweet potato fries are good too!"
4,"Wonderful! Ultimate 5 star experience in Vegas! We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We loved the appetizer tower that can be mixed and matched. Oysters were fantastic. The cocktail shrimp vanilla  We sat inside the 'space ship' or 'UFO'... Be sure to request this seating during your reservation.\n\nTo begin... Cocktails: Paloma was fantastic for the tart drink lovers. Elderflower martini was better for the sweet tooth! \n\nAppetizer: Cocktail jumbo shrimp, vanilla battered shrimp & oysters... Delish! \n\n\nSalad: We split the iceberg Wedge, please note that in photo... It's only half. The bacon used was a sweet hickory smoked Wisconsin bacon. Amazing. \n\nSoup: Lobster Bisque. Phenomenal. Rich & Creamy. \n\n\nEntree: Filet. Ordered med well but the cut was too thick and it ended up well done on outside and almost rare in the middle, but it was still fantastic.\n\nSide: King Crab & Black Truffle Gnocchi- TO DIE FOR. An absolute must. Yes, I actually chose this over my standard potatoes au gratin with steak and was do glad I did.\n\nCreamed spinach was fantastic. \n\nWe ended our meal with Cappuccinos.\n\nThank you for well educated wait staff and quality service."
0,"I have been to Mad Hatter a few times. The first couple of times, it was only to order a beer off tap, so it is impossible to judge an experience off of that. However, I recently visited this establishment and ordered a few drinks and food, and the experience was so bad I was inclined to write this review (look at my account, I barely ever do this). The drink (an AMF) was the worst I had ever had, and I am used to $1 drinks at the Vine that taste like top shelf in comparison to this $6 concoction. The nachos were average at best, but the service was horrific. I was one of only a handful of patrons at the bar, and the server/bartender could have easily come to my table to take my order or to see if I was happy. Instead, I had to go to the bar to ask for things constantly. And when I asked for more lemons, he refused my request and made fun of me for wanting lemons. Way to treat a guest. I think it may have been the owner's son. He was white, tall and had brown hair. He looked like it was painful for him to be here, he probably only works there because his dad owns the joint and he can't find work anywhere else, which isn't surprising with that work ethic. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip, and I will never be coming back. What a shame, I live right by ASU. Avoid at all costs!"
0,"Alex A. was craving some Chinese food, so we headed over to the Chinese Cultural Center and decided on trying Lao Ching Hing. I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. \n\nAt first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.\n\nWe ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.\n\nI think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place. I will not be returning."
0,"I've been here so many times sometimes the service is good an sometimes it's bad. Which means that when I order the steak and eggs w/ hash browns and they cooked \""my steak to death\"" so to speak. Anyways they sometimes cook it right then wrong. Sometimes even though the price is right it's quality doesn't stand to this caf\u00e9's standards. Definitely not going back anymore. But, most of the time the waiters are really nice which is good."
3,Great place. Huge portions and very interesting food! Saw this on Man v. Food so I knew that I had to try it. What I got I didn't really like but what everybody else was eating looked amazing!
1,Came here for a night out with friends and was excited about the idea of free games. After my entire evening the biggest draw remains the free games. There area for actual games is very small as is the bar. There was a group of 5 of us so we decided to grab a table and order some drinks. Our waitress was horrible. I don't know if they were short staffed or what but after being seated and taking our drink orders we waited at least 20 minutes for cocktails. I hadnt ordered with the group bc i was late but I went to the bar came back finished my drink before she came back to take our food orders. We literally saw her twice in an hour and a half worth of eating and drinking. It was faster getting my cocktail directly from the bar. The food is ok I had the breakfast sliders which alone are decent they come with a  side of gravy which is flavorless. As a whole I wasn't impressed with Hi-Scores and wouldn't make the trip across town to come back.
2,"It's decent food downtown, but the service is lackluster half the time and the chow mein is either dry or super soggy."
1,"Came here in 2011 and they had a 50 cent beer special on Tues.  Stop by again this year during Spring Training on Tues, it was empty because the special was over."
1,"This place suuuucked! Wanted to try a new breakfast restaurant since I was tired of going to the same ones all the time, so thought I'd try this place. We were seated in a back room where the tables were literally right up against each other. There was no on right next to us so I thought it would be ok. 5 mins later they sat someone right up against us. I don't understand this... Why do hostesses think anyone wants to sit right against another full table. My back was literally 1 inch from the guy next to me. Very uncomfortable! \n\nWe ordered our food.. I got a French toast combo and the wife got an omelette and potatoes. The potatoes were tasteless.  They basically were just French fries with no seasoning. Horrible. The omelette was just bleh...  French toast was also just bleh.. Had no taste at all. The homemade sausage patties were ok, but way over seasoned. They tasted more like a meatball. Very weird. Everything was just barely ok... But far from good.  \n\nThe only thing I liked was the coffee. \n\nTotal bill for my wife, 2 young kids, and myself was over $50. Way overpriced for breakfast... Especially a tasteless one. \n\nI wouldn't recommend or go back."
3,I feel like sometimes the saucer is over rated but maybe that's because sometimes I just want a Miller Lite
4,"Its been over a year, and we can't be happier with the guys at Ultimate Lawn. We recently added some backyard chickens and they were out and about when the guys showed up. They waited patiently for my wife to round up the chickens and get them back in the coop.....after about 5 min of watching her chase them around and the chickens making a fool of my wife...the guys very quickly and efficiently gathered them up and popped them back into the coop. Thanks guys!"
4,"My first ramen, and the best! Since my first visit here I've been to other ramen places, and they can't compare. I loved the tan tan men. No other compares. I frequent this place often as it is just down the street from my house.   I also must add, it is cheap so it doesn't hurt my wallet."
3,"We really like Masa.  Pineapple fried rice is tasty, but we usually go for the 2 for $7 lunch special.  Sushi is not the most creative or even the best, but it is quality and great for this area (without driving into the city).  The owner is very kind and the staff are friendly."
0,"I love Steak 'n Shake.  I was so very excited to see a billboard advertising this location as we drove into Vegas this weekend.  We schlepped out to South Point on Friday night to get some shakes, and were surprised by the line.  No big deal, we'll just get our shakes to go.  There's a line inside the restaurant for the take-out counter, and the hostess tells us to get in line outside the doors.  OK, fine... so we wait.  And wait.  And the line doesn't move at all.  After about 15 minutes, my friend finally gets the hostess to talk to him, and she said that it would be at least another 30 minutes until we could order.  WTF?!  Have these people never worked in a take-out situation?  It seemed like they were taking an order, cooking that order, and then charging that order... not taking another order until the prior order was cooked.  I don't get it.  Literally, we saw *one* take-out order leave while we were in that line for 15 minutes.\n\nWe just wanted shakes.  There's no reason in the world why this place is so very disorganized.  We left without our shakes and ended up at Dairy Queen with friendly service.  I miss Steak 'n Shake and will have to visit one in the midwest on my next trip there - and just try to forget that there's a lame attempt at one in the South Point casino in Vegas."
1,"Looked at the rating and thought it would be exciting....but nothing at all special.  The huevos rancheros SUCKED.  Very bland, nothing great at all.  We also got some dish that was mushrooms, cheese and spinach on a bialy (but they were out so it was on a english muffin)  not bad.  But for like $10 I and tons of good reviews, I would expect more than just tortillas from a bag on the side of over easy eggs and like 2 pieces of avocado."
4,"I have had a difficult time finding a decent Brazilian waxer in Charlotte. I have had some very unpleasant experiences so\nI decided to try sugaring. Debbie is amazing. She is quick, painless & very personable.\nHer studio is clean & great availability. I highly recommend her!"
3,"We came in on a cold Wednesday night.  It was quite crowded.   We could have sat at a table reserved for others later but, had to be finished by a certain time.  We decided to wait for another table to open up, though I guess we could have sat at the sushi counter too.  Noticed others coming in for take out to avoid this problem.\n\n I got a beef sukiyaki dinner and my husband got the tempura/teriyaki combo.  My sukiyaki hit the spot.  I thought the broth was tasty and it had a good portion of beef in it too.  My husband said there was a a lot of food in his combo and thought everything was delicious.  We were both stuffed and had no room for dessert.  My dinner came with soup, salad, and rice as did my husband's so it was a very good value.  \n \n Noticed a review complaining about the service but we had no problem. The staff brought our food promptly,  asked if everything was okay and seemed friendly enough to me.  We noticed there were a lot of families with children who came to the restaurant and the staff seemed very accommodating."
2,"Just got back from lunch, and I am just not enjoying this place as much as I used to. \n\nI will start with the meh:\n\nFirst off, they raised the prices and took away the union discount. That bugged me a little, to have a discount for union members and then just take it away. Bah! Also, it was $40 for lunch, 3 burgers, fries and drinks, and that just seems high to me, especially since you can get a cheaper lunch at nearby places (Custom Built or Five Guys are great) Really for a place where you order at a counter and grab your own food when it is done, I do not expect to pay $40 for lunch. The place was pretty empty compared to how I remember it from before, so maybe other people feel the same?\n\nOn to the good:\n\nThe food was very good. We all enjoyed the burgers and fries and the toppings bar is always fun. The employees working that day were super nice and attentive. \n\nIf I was rating just the food and employees I would give it 5 stars for sure, but the high price and no more union discount irritates me enough to drop 2 stars."
1,"Nothing special here. Some lights, a DJ, a small dance area, mediocre drinks, decently priced for a place in the Mandalay Bay, and lots of sitting room.  Convenient for those staying at the Mandalay Bay or The Hotel and not too crowded (no cover, open seats available) but almost too loud for talking with friends."
3,"A great little spot.  My friends took me here for my going away party.  It is small and in a strip mall.  The gentleman, who helped us, was friendly.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  I got the tamale sampler and it was really good. I loved all three but really enjoyed the cheese/green chili one.  The prices were very reasonable!!!  I couldn't believe we were the only ones in there."
0,"Crappy service. Two parties one of 20 and one of 10 came in and management acted like it was the end of the world. They all freaked out. Resulted in kicking a family out of their table when they have already been seated.\nMy party came in, was seated. With no menu. For 5 minutes. Tell me what's wrong in this picture.\nWe tried to flag a server to order, he rudely told us to hold on. After we finally got to order, we waited another 15 mins just to get water.\n\nI am still currently waiting for my food. It's been close to an hour. At this point, their food could be the best in this world and I still wouldn't care."
3,"I know it's almost against Vegas Law for a gambler to buy alcohol in a Casino. And yes, I am fully aware that cocktail waitresses will come by as I'm pushing buttons on the penny slots and bring me free drinks. \n\nBut sometimes I just want to drink something that tastes like a Blue Raspberry Slurpee and have it get me buzzed. And thanks to Evening Call, and its Coco Loco drink, I know this is possible. And guess what? It was so tasty that I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE. And I'll probably do it again!"
4,"Of all the coffee shops downtown Barriques is my favorite, and not just because it the closest one to my house.  I usually just get brewed coffee, but their lattes are good, and they have a big variety of teas.  Their sandwiches and salad are good too(a little pricey); I like the tuna sandwich, and the hummus sandwich.  Their cookies are really good too, especially the Cowboy cookie.  \n\nI also use Barriques as my wine shop.  I can always find something I like, and the staff are usually very helpful with suggestions.  \n\nMy only complaint about Barriques is that it can be hard to find a seat during the day on the weekends and on some evenings."
4,"I truly enjoyed Stax. My friend and I happened to stumble on Stax right before our movie. I was really hesitant since I had never been here before and we didn't have much time. However, the server came up and explained the entire menu to us and made some recommendations, which we went with. We were not sorry that we did either! We each had a Wagyu and Short Rib burger and they were both awesome, but the Short Rib was the best! I was really surprised how flavorful they both were.\n\nThe service was really good too. My drink never went unfilled and the food didn't take too long. When we needed to get going, our server was fast to get the check to us. \n\nI will definitely be going back again, and I don't even live close!"
4,"Amazing remodel! Not what you would expect from outside. The service is fantastic. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating. Just had lunch with my daughters. Everything we ordered, apps, salads and the turkey sandwich was great!!! I'd recommend this restaurant and have every intention of visiting again. Just go!"
4,"\""Am I a little drunk? Maybe, but I still give it a five,\"" my husband.\n\nBright, clean, open atmosphere. Small tables for small groups and one large table for, I presume, communal dining. Very casual and delicious food. It feels healthy in here :-)"
3,"Their chicken is AMAZING! I enjoy this place and the funny thing is I had never been here until this past spring and I have been going to school for three years now. I was the one people starred at when talking about Chipotle and I pipe in that I have never been. Silence had fallen every time. \n\nHowever, now that I know what it is all about, I am a fan! I try to go all the time when I can! I enjoy their tacos. Their rice has the perfect lime bite to it, the black beans are delicious and the cheese just melts into the chicken which makes it all the more tasty! Their tortilla chips are awesome too. Some of them have a little more lime on them then others, so when you bite into it, your face puckers up for just a second, but still pretty darn yummy. I love the fact that the lettuce is always fresh too. Never a brown dry spot on it! \n\nThe serving sizes are massive and I think it is cool that they list the calories in everything on their menu for those who care. Depending on what you get, I feel that this is healthy fast food. The lines get long because of how popular they are, but they tend to have a process that makes it go pretty fast. Now all they need is a bigger sitting area and it would be prefect!"
2,"Aight...So, I gave it three stars only because the nightclub is cool. I like it because it's not a gi-normous club, but also the decor is cool. Since I dig the nightclub I bumped it up from a two to a three star rating. Now, the restaurant, bleh. The food was okay, nothing special. The only thing special about the experience was the service. Servers attire: jeans, a blue gap shirt, apron and chucks. It doesn't get any cooler than that. I wish I could remember our servers name, as she deserves recognition. Unfortunately I can't remember everything we ordered, but hey if it was awesome I would remember. All I know is, everything was over priced for the size of the portions. Some of the items we ordered:  Cuban sliders, roasted chicken, beet salad (I think), a fig flat bread (once again, I think) and of course desert and a couple of bottles of wine. meh...\n\nThe decor and ambiance is killer, I love it. And gentlemen, take note, girls bathing girls..."
2,"The food here is delicious, our waitress on the other hand was so ridiculous. She was taking pictures  with the other table after we had asked for a box and our check. She was also aware we were on a lunch break from work. She forgot everything and could care less about us. She was more interested in the guys at our neighboring table. \n\nI think i'll stick to ordering food to-go from here"
1,"Pappa deaux more like Papa-don't. The only reason to come here is the 3.95 dozen oysters. We got here super early on a sunday afternoon (4:30) and the place was still packed for lunch. Service was friendly, kitchen was a little slow, the food was a step above Red Lobster. The stuffed friend shrimp and crab was not really good at all. I guess if you live at least 4 hours a way from fresh ocean this place will have to do."
3,"Whenever I step inside LGO, I feel like I've been transported to a small village in the South of France. I forget there's a cactus population down the road and a desert mountain out the window. All I can think of is how treatfully delicious their larger-than-life muffins are, how scrumptious their cookies are and how wonderfully filling their selections like the tuna melt and wood fire pizza are. Whether I'm in the mood for a cup of coffee, a full breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, a sweet tooth craving, a delicious pizza or a bottle of wine; LGO is my go-to spot. \n\nSo my suggestion is to visit LGO if you\n\n...Like good food \n...Like a good atmosphere\n...Are looking for a place to relax and read the newspaper or magazine \n...Are looking for a place to do some off-site work during the day\n...Are looking for a family-friendly and reasonably priced spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n...Want a cup of coffee\n...Want an afternoon snack \n... Are hungry \n\nAnd when you do find an excuse to make your way to LGO, here are some of my top suggestions:\n\n- Commuter Sandwich \n- Crepes \n- Tuna Melt \n- Tuna Sandwich \n- Turkey Sandwich \n- Pizza \n- Chelsea Kitchen Burger \n- Homemade English muffins\n- Any cookie (my favorite is the apple one...I believe it's seasonal)\n\nNote: If you go during lunchtime, or on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, be prepared to go on the hunt for parking and a seat once you get inside. But don't let it dissuade you from your visit. It's worth it, I promise!"
4,"i am such a HUGE fan of forrest gump! it's one of my all time favorite movies! :]\n\nso this was my first time eating at a bubba gump and i've got to say, i fell in love with the theme. it was so interesting! there were so many signs and there were pictures and newspapers. there were also these adorable little signs that said run forrest run, and stop forrest stop!\n\nthe prices are were high but i thought it was fun. my friends and i were sat at such a bright room, and it was spacious and white! i think it was meant to resemble forrest's home since it seemed like it was back in the day. it was decorated with plates and pictures which i thought was extremely cool!\n\nthe waitresses were the nicest people i've ever met. they came every time, just to check up on us, which means, drinks all day every day!\n\nanyways, loved the place and i'll come back next time when i go back to vegas!"
3,"I took a hot air balloon ride with Unicorn Balloon at sunrise on a Saturday morning.  The experience was really cool and I especially enjoyed it since it was my first ballooning experience.  My group had purchased Groupons for this trip and we had no trouble redeeming them.  The process is pretty easy- you meet them and they drive you in a van to the launch location, and you're dropped off in the same place they picked you up.  The entire trip lasts about 4 hours, with one hour of flight time. I thought this was the perfect amount of time as I was ready to come down by the end.\n\nThe desert scenery was beautiful and our pilot, Captain Bubba, seemed very experienced and was entertaining.  Although the basket seemed small to fit 12 people, this ended up not being an issue and the ride was comfortable.  \n\nMy only concern was our landing- apparently the people who were supposed to follow us and help us land were filling out our ballooning certificates so they were late.  We pretty much crashed into the ground, bounced up and crashed back down a few times.  Luckily everyone was okay but this should not have happened.\n\nYou are also provided with a champagne breakfast after landing."
3,"Good food can take a restaurant a long way.  Not much to say about the atmosphere, but this place has great bar food.  The patio is a great place to people watch on East Blvd while drinking a cold beverage."
4,"I'm so happy I found this place! I moved to AZ almost 3 years ago and have been searching for a great stylist since then. After reading reviews here, I scheduled a cut with Deanne. She did a great job, listened to exactly what I was asking for, and was very friendly. The atmosphere of the salon is also awesome. I was welcomed with a delicious cup of Aveda tea and had a great scalp massage. My cut was $45 (including wash and style) which I thought was very reasonable. Highly recommend!"
2,"Five stars for the pie.\n\nThree stars for the service when I was there for lunch with my dad, which is what this check in was for. He'd brought his dog with on his visit to see me, so we had to sit outside. The outdoor seating area was filthy and our server rarely came out to see us. The food was wonderful, but that only partially makes up for the state of where we ate."
4,"The Mission serves \""modern Latin cuisine in a sophisticated yet casual setting\"" according to their website. Actually, I'd say the Mission serves the best meal in the greater Phoenix area with a simple and romantic flair. So much for adjectives, as there may not be enough to accurately describe this dining experience.\n\nFirst off, The Mission makes me want to \""re-calibrate\"" my other Yelp reviews as this is truly a real 5 star place. \n\nWe are staying in a wonderful 5 star resort where the concierge suggested this dining spot, but also let us know (under full disclosure) that she is employed by The Mission as a bartender. She gave us 2 tips: \""You must try the Duck Empandas and the Peruvian Stew\"". Peruvian stew is actually called \""Almejas Al Vapor\"" and consists of peruvian clam stew + rock shrimp + chorizo + pan de yucca + aji amarillo + roast corn, and is a bit spicy. I thought this was an odd choice as it's 80 degrees outside dining on their lovely patio, but we tried both. \n\nThe Almejas Al Vapor is an incredible dish. Each bite reveals a new twist and many new flavors. Unbelievable call, and no, it doesn't make you seem warmer than normal. The Duck Carnitas Empanadas are excellent and are a bit cheesy. If you like white sauces and cheese, you'll love this dish. The dish consists of duck + foie gras + orange + habanero + oregano + mushroom + queso oaxaca baked in a homemade empanada shell. Honestly, I was trying to pace myself, so I only ate a few bites of an excellent small plate..\n\nOur excellent server had her favorite appetizer and insisted we try the \""lettuce wraps\"", aka Crispy Cola Pork consisting of pork belly + cola + lime + chiltepin + peanut + pickled red onion wrapped in gem lettuce.\nThis dish is excellent and the lettuce cleverly is placed on the peanut sauce such that you only get every flavor if you eat by hand v with a fork. You'll have to try it to understand what I'm saying.\n\nAfter appetizers, I was forced to \""downsize\"" the entree and we split the Steak Tacos. The story we'd heard about this place was the Chef who is famous for French Cuisine and created Zinc Bistro always wants a \""Taco stand\"". This is far beyond a Taco stand, but you get the French influence and clever presentation, with Latin cuisine and perfect use of spices and sauces making the Mission unique. \n\nDessert time which means it's time to split the Fired Bananas. Generally, I skip dessert, but Fried Bananas is one of my favorite foods, and these are the best I have ever had. \n\nFirst, the presentation: The fried banana are actually placed in a cinamon tortilla shell. There's house-made peanut butter and Cinamon Gellato on the plate. This is all rounded off with a simple, elegant cinamon/sugar mixture (heated as a light sauce) with a few peanuts as garnish. Here's the menu's description: Fried Bananas butter + nutmeg + peanuts and dulche de leche.\n\nWe sat on the patio as our bartender suggested this was a quiet romantic spot...excellent call. There are two other dining areas, a front patio and the inside which has a large bar. Inside seemed loud and would be a good happy hour spot. The back patio was wonderful for romantic outdoor ambiance. \n\nLast, and not at all least, our service was wonderful. The server on the back patio knew all of the dishes, made great wine recommendations and was just a wonderful, upbeat person who knew food. \n\nThis place required a 2-day advance reservation during Baseball Spring training, but is well worth the planning process. I look forward to the next visit!"
2,"Here's the thing: yep, it's new and clean and lacks all of the nastiness of Wrigley, HOWEVER- make 100% sure you have ticketed seats (not lawn or the Eighteen |76 club) because there aren't any visible scoreboards!!! There's one tiny board listing inning & score visible from anywhere in the outfield. \n\nAlso, if you do have Eighteen | 76 tickets, get there early to claim seats, or perish in the blazing sun. ;)"
3,"Love CDJ.  \n\nOld school Vegas in Mexican restaurant form.\n\nPretty diverse menu, good service, and good food.\n\nI stop in whenever I get a chance."
4,Nice..
2,"I had a coupon for a free kabob so I obviously had to give this place a try. I went for the lamb kabob and a the taftoon bread. The food was made fresh and was ready in about 10-15 mintues.\n\nI was especially excited to try to taftoon bread since it's made to order. It was huge and came out piping hot. It smelled so good, but sadly I was a bit disappointed. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was actually quite dense. And as it cooled, it just got tougher and tougher. The kabab was good and had a nice flavor, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one. Overall, decent food at decent prices."
1,"Not my fav coffee place. Baristas tend to be quite pushy. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a latte. Wasn't even sure it was my latte when she called it out cuz she rattled off something incoherent and when I asked if it was mine she got snotty with me. I will never get another breakfast sandwich there again! They pulled it out of a plastic wrap and tossed it into a warmer! It more than likely came to the store frozen. If I want that I'll order from the Schwann's guy and make it myself. \n\nOverall, not impressed."
4,"Malinda's is right around the corner from home so we decided to try them out for grooming. I have to say the entire staff was friendly and Kim the groomer did a great job with my little guy. He was a little scared going into a new place, but came out happy, calm, and tail wagging. We have definitely found a new grooming home!"
3,delicious breakfast as always... one of the best breakfast spots in green valley.  the wait on the weekends seems to be long sometimes but its worth it.
2,"I have been here for a basketball game and a concert. Let me just say it's not good for a concert. They close off half the arena and leave only a small pocket on the floor for general admission. I can't imagine being in that sandwich trying to see the show. Second, they don't serve alcohol... which is an adjustment for a rock concert. Third, the seats are uncomfortable, and the rows of seats are so close together that there is no leg room. Your knees are seriously on the person's shoulders in front of you if you are 6'0 or taller.\nThe sound didn't travel like it normally would in a normal concert. It wasn't that loud, in other words.\nOn the positive, parking was a cinch. It was $5 to park right next to the arena, and the workers were helpful with the directions to the Will Call. Once inside, the security was a joke. They used a metal detector on us, and it said I was clear with keys and a camera in my pockets. Good thing I didn't bring a weapon!\n\nIt's a good place to catch a basketball game, but I wouldn't want to see another concert here."
0,Terrible Service! I do not recommend this establishment. Stopped in for a simple mani and gel polish removal. I specifically asked the nail tech not to file the polish off as it can be damaging to the natural nail. She insisted on filing the polish off. Walked away with a poorly done mani and messy polish :(
0,"This place is the Pitts (putting it mildly).we walked in after church on a Sunday afternoon,my friend's young boys wanting Denny's pancakes,we got there the place was empty after waiting a few minutes to be seated the host walked us past eight empty stalls that would have been fine for the 5 of us three adults and two young boys,she put us way in the back next to the stinky restrooms then after 5 minutes of waiting we decided to bail,mind you the place was near empty.We did not want to make a scene in front of the boys we decided to eat at an other place where we we're treated with respect,my take this place or the workers do not take well to people not like them.The restaurant was dated and it was dirty if i where the owners of the Denny's name i would make this franchise change their name,guess they don't realize that the 60's are long gone."
1,"I was hoping this place would be better. I ate breakfast there with my family and it was not the best. With such a small breakfast menu, one would think it would be served rather quickly even if its made to order. Take biscuits and gravy for example. That is a fast dish to prepare, but it still took all too long to make it to the table. The Sunshine on a cloud, was anything but. It was dry and the yolk was overcooked and far from over easy. The muffins were great and very fresh, we would definitely return for those, but we will wait a while before trying breakfast meals again."
0,Dropped my car off at 11am for a regular oil change 6 hours later not even touched. They blamed it on their oil guy calling in sick. So I guess their other mechanics can't change oil on cars. This will probably be the last time I use Fletcher's.
1,"Seriously sub par on the soft serve yogurt craze. I have been to ALL the others, and this was seriously the worst. The yogurt is SO runny.... the flavors are mostly just \""meh\"", nothing exciting, and the toppings do not look fresh at all. \n\nOn the few occasions I have been here, the employees seem to always be put out that you ask for samples. Hey-ya know what assholes? Don't insist on doing it YOURSELF then. Leave it to the customers. But do not be surly.\n\nYogurtology is hands down the best. No contest."
4,Best bbq place hands down!!!! Ive been here twice I get the 3 meat plate with double mac its so much that I always have lots of lwdtover for later!  If you are in Vegas and love bbq THIS is the spot. There is a bit of a wait but totally worth it!
3,"I crave Indian food pretty regularly and I'm happy to know that there are a number of Indian restaurants in Madison to satisfy my craving.\n\nThe samosa, vegetable pakora, paneer (cheese) pakora are decent.  However, the Aloo Tikki (small spicy potato discs) is very tasty with the right amount of spices.\n\nI LOVE Parantha (layered whole wheat bread made with melted butter) and the Maharani Parantha here are delicious and remind me of when I used to make these with mom.  You have to eat them right when they come out though because that's when they're the best - hot, buttery, crispy and tender.  \n\nThe Roti Naan is pretty good too.  Made exactly the way naan is (baked in a tandoor oven) except they use whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  \n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala is delectable.  The sauce is orange colored, rich, creamy and has nice chunks of boneless chicken (could use more chunks of chicken).  This is also spiced really nicely.  You get a choice of mild, medium or hot for the level of spiciness in your dishes.  Medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hot.\n\nThe Palak Paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy, spicy and buttery.  This is really, really good.  The only thing about the dish is that the ginger pieces were a little overwhelming.\n\nDessert\nGulab Jamun (it's like a deep fried dounut hole soaked in sugar syrup) has been my favorite Indian dessert since childhood.  Not a lot of places know how to make this dessert right.  It has to be lite and airy not dense and hard.  Maharani makes it just right and hot off of the stove!  It's delicious!"
3,I love going to the mall and it is close \nWhere I stay for vacation Yeay....!\nI will try to come here when I come to Vegas...!
4,"One of my favorites. Healthy options for breakfast and lunch. A great place to hold work meetings as there is free wifi and during the week it is not too loud. Love sitting outside on the patio. Staff is nice and service is usually spot on. They even have \""healthy\"" alcoholic drinks like their smoothie with champagne! Love the Waldorf salad, not too saturated in dressing but refreshing."
1,"This has been the first time I've been disappointed going to a steakhouse in Vegas. We had a reservation for 8 and Delmonicos and everyone almost hated their steak or fish. I myself had a halibut, but also shared the ribeye. I also had a taste of the lobster bisque. the bisque was very good and could recommend that. but as for the halibut and steak, they were very salty. our whole table said the same thing about the steak and fish. we were very surprised that we were disappointed at an emeril restaurant. maybe the chef in the back had a bad day. in the end, you wont see me here again."
2,"I went to Avenue B with my sister, whose boyfriend used to be a chef there.\n\nI was not sure if she was a little impartial towards it for that reason. I have to say, the food and ambiance was great. it is small, BYOB, and they write their menu on large chalkboards every night. \n\nWe had an apple/fennel/gorgonzola salad. I had the kobe meatloaf and she had a grilled wahoo. For dessert we shared the lavender cake with panna cota. All of it was terrific. The kobe meatloaf was especially delicious and I really enjoyed the flavor.\n\nOnly downfall- it is hard to get in (apparently you don't come unless you have a reservation) and it is quite pricey. The plates are all decorated and the portions are very small - in high end restaurant fashion. I dont mind spending $ on food when it is as tasty . . .  so all in all I would probably go back again, maybe on a date night."
0,"This place was HORRIBLE. It might have been the worst service I've ever experienced. \nWe were shunted to the side of the restaurant and ignored, and I suspect it's because we indicated we were not interested in wine. \nWe ordered two desserts. One was the Panna Cotta, and I am not exaggerating when I say it was clearly made in a dipping sauce container. It was $16, and hardly three mouthfuls. \nWe had to ask for forks, and wait forever. We had to ask for napkins, and wait again. Our coffee took ten minutes to arrive, and we had to ask for condiments. \nIf you like snobbery, bad service and wasting money, go here. \nIf you'd prefer something better with more value, better service and higher quality, go to Pinot Brasserie across the Casino. It's much, much better."
1,"My rating of HRH is somewhere between Mehh and Down-Right-Rude. The place is empty on a Saturday afternoon and you would think they would try harder to please guests and players. But instead security barked at patrons that no outside food and alcohol was allowed in rooms. Come again? Isn't this Las Vegas where we party in and out of the hotel rooms. I tried to show my friends at an empty table how to play craps, we all threw down $100 each and we got nothing but attitude from the grouppier and pit boss. Maybe that's why the place is empty - I am happy to lose my money some other place."
1,"When I first heard about Haulin' Balls, my inner 12 year old boy giggled and was determined to check it out. A few First Fridays ago, a friend and I went on a quest to find the food truck with a funny name, but couldn't find it. We asked at the info tent and they said they saw the truck pull up, but there wasn't enough room, so they left. We checked Facebook/Twitter, but they hadn't posted anything. That would have been a good way to let people know they weren't there! We ended up at Roamin' Dough and had delicious meatball sacks (she said sack.)\nThis Friday, we finally found our balls! (Heehee.) They had two types: Godfather and Zorba. We decided on the Godfather. We asked the gal how big her balls were (heehee, I'll stop now) and she said they were big enough to share. We were glad because $10 for a meatball sandwich sounded a bit high. She then informed us they were out of cheese...mozzarella AND feta. Blah. We went ahead and ordered it to share, along with some sweet potato tots.\nAre you kidding me? Ten bucks for TWO average sized meatballs on half a sub roll? It needed more sauce and the cheese sure would have been nice. The meatball itself was flavorful, but the texture was a bit gristly (granted, I am super picky about my meat.) The sweet potato tots were fine, but nothing magical for $3.\nI'm bummed. I REALLY wanted to like Haulin' Balls. It's not that it was BAD, it was just overpriced and I don't get how you run out of cheese at 8:30pm at First Friday! You kind of know it's going to be busy!"
3,"Although I've eaten there a handful of times, Bandung is my go-to take out place. There are deals you can get by ordering online, and we usually order some combination of Pad Thai, Red Curry Squash, Opor Ayam, and Lumpia for our appetizer. Other favories include Galai Kambing,Sambal Goreng Ketang, Bihun Kari, and Asse Cabe. Our only complaint about the take out is that they never give you enough rice -- one big spoonful (probably about 1/2 cup) per entree. My husband loves rice so we always have to make more at home. \n\nAlthough we order from there all the time, it is worth going there and checking it out.  They have EXCELLENT drinks. They also have clearly been working on revamping the bar area, introducing some bar food specials, etc. One time I played trivia there and it was pretty good except there wasn't really enough seating. \n\nAll in all Bandung is a unique place and a unique eating experience. In my opinion, their Pad Thai is the best in town -- and that's saying something!"
3,"We always wanted to check this place out, and we finally did after we had dinner out (somewhere else) and started craving chocolate lava cake.  Unless you are at a steakhouse, you probably won't find chocolate lava cake on the menu.  So we agreed we would go to Crave if they had lava cake.  A quick google search later, we were on our way.\n\nMy husband loved the lava cake (although he commented it was a smaller version compared to a steakhouse's).\n\nI ordered the birthday cake martini and it was AMAZING!  Tasted like you would want it to taste and was served in a martini glass rimmed with SPRINKLES.  Yum!\n\nWe wanted to sit outside on the patio, and I guess that's a good thing because the hostess said the inside was full, even though it looked empty.  I suppose reservations?\n\nThe inside does look cool and like a good place to go with a group.  It does look very \""lounge-y\"" where you could sit around a table in a large, round, private booth.\n\nI know I will take my girlfriends here for a drink when they come visit."
4,It's too bad this store has such a bad review from one customer. I have had two positive experiences with customer service here - one woman gave me a helpful tip to cut down printing costs. And if you want cheap printing for course readings - ups was nearly half the cost of fed ex and much less than office max it was kind of unbelievable. Glad I called around first!
4,"It is so exciting to finally have an excellent restaurant up here in Anthem!  Vic Vegas and his team have really outdone themselves.  Although they are still in the soft opening phase, the service and quality of food are top notch.  The views from the restaurant are incredible looking over the valley .  Earlier in the week, we enjoyed dinner there with friends.  All of the appetizers were excellent!  Especially enjoyed the calamari and the black and blue sliders.  When you sit down, they say \""welcome home to Vic's....and that's exactly what you feel like.  The mixed drinks are excellent (interesting glassware, but it's fun)!!!.  Last night we tried their  onion/macaroni and cheese soup that was delicious.   We were  impressed with the service both nights we were there...Vic was walking around and checking on how things were going which is something that all restaurateurs should do. We wish them well in this new venture!"
0,"Rude management, rude corporate, dirty carpets and roaches & various bugs!!!\n\nOk so I had an unfortunate issue with the management staff before moving in.  Read my previous review for details. I moved in and there was chunks of dirt as well as grey carpet stains everywhere. I called Rachel the customer service representative who admitted to forgetting to call me back about my customer service issue the previous week, then to cover up her mistake she said customer service at the San Portella location isn't her priority because they are opening a new location. She transferred me to Priscilla who was much more on top of things and helpful.  Apparently Kenny, on the management team, never gave us a form for us to fill out regarding preexisting damages so we don't get charged when we move out.  \n\nWhen we moved in there was chunks of dirt, grey stains all over the carpet. We made several appointments with maintenance who never came. We have found cockroaches and crickets everywhere. Dirty tile, and sticky cabinets and countertops. \n\nHopefully, after talking to Priscilla she will follow through with pest control and carpet cleaning and not forget to call me back like the other customer service representative, Rachel."
1,"This is my main spot for all sports clothing and accessories. The selection, prices, and sales are always good. But obviously, there's a reason for my two stars. I went through my bank records, and online purchases, and I've spent close to about $5,000 at dick's and this past weekend, dick's lost this business from me. \nI'm an avid golfer. I golf about 3-4 times a week and put a lot of money into my equipment and into my game in general. Yesterday (8/12/2012), a friend of mine and I go to test some new clubs to improve his game and I wanted to test out some drivers. There were two gentlemen handling the golf section on a day that was pretty quiet. No shoppers in the golf section (a few in the shoe area), no one else wanting to demo clubs, and one of the employees (the old guy) was testing out a new putter on the putting green while closely watching the final round of the PGA championship on their televisions. \nI asked the older guy to demo some new Taylormade irons. I hit about 6 shots, and my friend stepped up and hit about 3 shots. Their shot technology was good, and demo area was nice. I then asked to demo the new Cobra AMP driver that was directly infront of me in a demo bag. The older guy frowned, and said \""Well a couple more guys and we'll wrap it up.\"" I was in shock, my entire golf set costs nearly $3000 and I was demoing a club that costs $250 and was told that I can only hit a few more, before I even hit the damn club! I put down the club and said, \""with that remark, I don't need to hit this driver.\""  I asked, \""Well there's no one else waiting to demo clubs and am I not a serious customer to you?\"" \nHe said, \""Well I just have a few things going on here that needs to be taken care of.\"" Says the guy, who when we walked up was watching TV and putting on the their practice area. I'm sorry, but isn't this guy's job to sell me clubs? And let me demo as much as I please to make a $300 decision? I felt incredibly disrespected and completely judged. I spoke with the store manager, and I'll never go back here and I hope that guy learned a lesson on how to treat a customer he knows nothing about."
4,Awesome!!! if a big slice of greasy yummy pizza is what your looking for here it is. The staff is nice and the service is quick. If I lived around here it would be dangerous.
1,"I'm just not impressed enough to make shopping here a regular event.  The store is clean, layout is well organized, and the bulk section is interesting.  I do like the fact you can make your own peanut / almond butter.  However I am a big time hater of places not accepting credit cards!  I was also not blown away by the prices.  Sure some of the items I buy were anywhere from a dime or less cheaper, but some actually cost more then Fry's.  The big savings was in their off brand stuff.  However I don't care how much cheaper some stuff is, I will never buy certain things made in Mexico!  The quality is just too low.  All in all this place should be able to survive in the ultra competitive Metro Phoenix market, but they won't be a leader.  They are in the Walmart & Food for less boat."
1,"Let me assure you that there is nothing imperial or anything 'palace-like' regarding this run down hell hole. From the smoke-ridden and dingy casino floor to the outdated and small rooms, the place pretty much lives up to the adage that you get what you pay for. Interestingly enough though, there is a reason to visit the IP. Their car collection is impressive, and the awesome Hash House a Go Go is on the second floor. So my suggestion is run, not walk past the locals in the casino and enjoy a great meal or a decent museum. You'll also find a very interesting parking area under the casino, with spots marked with a 'flood zone' warning. Yes, it is true that when Vegas get a large amount of rain in a short period of time (thunderstorms), all of the flood waters flow down the hill from the west underneath the Imperial Palace. Sort of disconcerting, don't you think? The IP is now called the Quad, and, well, things aren't much better."
2,"I've only been here for drinks.  Their beer selection is nothing to write home about -- it's missing some Madison staples. (No Leines, as well as various favorite Capitol Brews, but there is Spotted Cow.) However, I have always had friendly service and a good time."
0,"Let me start by saying that I love playing golf and I have probably played nearly 50 different tracks in AZ. I love playing at Dobson Ranch, it is a great course. For the money, it doesn't get much better. \n\nThe reason why I am giving them one star is pure and simple because of customer service. The guys that work in the pro shop are ridiculously rude, every time, no exceptions. I called to try and set up a tournament for my work with over 50 players. The total cost was going to exceed $60!!! That included the round, range balls, lunch and a gift card of some sort, plus the ridiculous $1 cart fee. It didn't matter if we didn't want lunch or the gift card, it was non negotiable.  This was more expensive that courses such as Legacy, The Raven and The Foothills.  \n\nFor someone who works in the customer service industry, there is nothing more important that treating customers the right way and Dobson Ranch failed miserably in my book."
2,Been here a few times when I used to live in Maricopa. I heard people have gotten sick here before. Hasn't happened to me. But the buffet makes me pretty sleepy afterwards.\n\nFood is pretty good
0,I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a bar. I had four drinks in two hours along with dinner and the waitress cut me off. I was no where closed to being even buzzed. Was really offensive. Wouldn't come back unless I sat at the bar directly.
2,"Its was the Saturday before Mothers day and my Florist still needed an hour to finish my order so I walked across the parking lot to the Cracked Egg.\n\nIt was late morning/very early afternoon and the place was packed. The entrance isn't designed too well as today you had to wade through a crowd to get to the register and ask to be seated or put your name on a list. When its time to go you have to wade through that same crowd to pay and then again to exit.  I know bars/clubs put in focal points to force patrons to mingle with eachother or to create the appearance of the place seeming \""hot\""  I just didnt appreciate the experience this early and espically to get a couple over easy eggs.  Simply stated the store is just to small for a restaurant this popular.\n\nThe food wasn't bad but my Mexican/Jalape\u00f1o dish was lacking in flavor and that is impressive as you really have to work hard to kill the flavor of a Jalape\u00f1o.\n\nThe service was pleasant enough but once my food was delivered I didn't see my waitress a single time (she gave me my check with the food) and nobody else stopped by to check on my 3/4 empty soda so it was a good thing my jalape\u00f1os weren't spicy or flavourful.\n\nI love this franchise but would recommend going on a non rush/less busy time so you can enjoy your food prepared with all the spices and ingredients they deserve and not be ignored.\n\nParking was a little tight as well. The store is located in a business plaza and not designed for easy in and out or for large hungry crowds."
0,"Absolutely awful experience. \n\nWe got two rooms, both of which had major issues with the key cards. Not only did we get locked out and have to get them replaced 4 times, once they actually had their maintenance guy come out with some tool to reprogram the door. The next day the keys again didn't work. Upon calling the front desk and me telling them the ordeal, their reply was \""well are you putting it next to your credit cards or your phone?\"".... Oh, you mean like any pocket or purse on earth? No, not after the first four sets of keys. Sometimes it tricks you. It flashes a green light saying \""come on in!\"" But then the door won't open anyway. \n\nOur air conditioning was also broken.... In the ON position. 24/7 air conditioning. Only way to turn it off is to crawl under it and unplug it. \n\nThe rooms have no fridge or safe. The \""do not disturb\"" cards go missing every night (I had to make one). The list goes on and on. \n\nNot worth it."
4,Thought we would try this out one afternoon. I got the chicken fried steak and eggs and my fianc\u00e9 got a blt. We both loved the food!! Prices were decent! I am a budget shopper. And our waitress was amazing!! We will definitely be visiting this place again!
1,"Just don't. Food was not very good and the price was high. The \""complementary\"" beer and wine offset some of the disappointment. Next time I will hit up the burger place."
3,"I was very happy with the food here. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. I enjoyed the sauce and meatballs were excellent. I especially liked their bread. Fresh-baked bread is always a plus. My stepson had tiramisu for dessert and he said it was delicious. He also enjoyed his calzone a lot. We went on a Friday night and it was busy, but we had reservations. \n\nI will definitely go back!"
0,Won't be going back to this place anytime soon.
2,"Let me start off by saying that I'd been waiting to try this place for a while and I had very high expectations. \n\nAnd it all could have been what I ordered...but for me this place was just okay. I'm allergic to pecans so their signature dish of Honey Pecan Chicken was out....but since I just had to try their milkshakes I opted for a chocolate shake and the Panther Burger (Black and Blue) with fries. \n\nI substituted a turkey burger for their regular patty. The burger comes only topped with blue cheese but I added lettuce and onions. For me it was just too dry and I could have used a little more seasoning. But the milkshake was tasty, very thick thick and creamy and the fries were crispy and hot. But overall I'm saying A-Ok. \n\nI'm totally willing to give them another chance, order something different and have another milkshake. So stay tuned for the update!"
3,My husband and I love China Grill.  We are originall from NY and this is the closet thing we have found to what we used to eat back home.  We always order the orange chicken and the pork fried rice is really really good.  The crab wontons could have more crab but otherwise they are pretty yummy.  We havent tried alot of their items but I did have the general Tsaos once and wasnt really impressed.\n\nOverall really good Chinese.
2,I actually think the food is four stars based on the airport scale of jeebusi'vebeenpoisonedtellmyfamilyilovethem to prettygoodactuallyididntjustgoovermycaloriesfortheweekinoneday.   Just clean your tables and give us more seats. It's crowded like a frat party on a Friday night. Forfuxsake.
3,bought cakes more than 20 times in their store...
0,"On 10/26/13, my friend Stacey took her car to Danny's for a car wash only to have her $150 ipod stolen right out of her car by one of Danny's workers.  She noticed the ipod was missing immediately upon entering her car and notified the manager and filed a police report.  Needless to say, Danny's has not rectified the situation.  If that's not reason enough to boycott Danny's, I don't know what is."
3,"The fresh salsa bar is the featured attraction.  20 - 30 types daily with differences nearly every day.  The food is great-to-fantastic.  Decor is nice and the space is small and tight.  Don't expect table service - go to the counter, order and pay.  They will bring you your food.  If you are looking for white linen napkin experience, go to The Barrio.  If you want some of the best salsa and tacos in town - come here."
2,"Dear Luxor,\n\nI want to like you. I mean, come on, you're a giant pyramid. However the 45 minute check-in line on a week day (not exaggerating) and the ten minute check-in process that made the line make more sense (still serious) was painful. \n\nWhat's even more painful? Being on the same side of the hotel as the pool -- that means being forced to listen to a very loud and proud rendition of Bruno Mars and every other top 40's hit at 8 a.m.. Sometimes your guests want to sleep in. Sometimes they don't want to be barraged with bad pop music until 10 o'clock. \n\nThat brings me to my next point... the pool and hot tub are only open till 8. (Everyone told me all things in Vegas are 24 hours, your pool doesn't even stay up as late as my grandparents.) And your work out room closes at 7?\n\nI want to like you, Luxor, I really do. You can start right now by turning down the music and restarting it in an hour with something sexier like Portishead or Goldfrapp. Please and thank you.\n\nYours,\n\nNaomi"
4,Lo-Lo's never disappoints!
4,"As many time as I've been here it's about time I review this place. One word \""outstanding\"" comes to mind They do cheesesteak right and their original hoagie has all the other sub shops beat by a mile. .  The owners could not be more friendly. Great family run place."
4,"this place is no starbucks, but then again I don't think they want to be! the coffee is AWSOME and the employee's are jacked up on coffee and happy as can be!!!!! love this place!!"
3,"Some friends of ours sat through a time-share presentation for free show tickets and dinner vouchers and gave us 2 free dinner vouchers for here. We walked up just after 4 pm on a saturday and asked if we could use the coupons for dinner at that time. The hostess/server said we could and sat us right away. She was polite and spoke with a beautiul Italian accent. \n\nWe were seated at a table for 2 right along the railing with people walking by in the Grand Canal Shoppes. While we enjoy people watching, it kind of backfired on us as we were trying to enjoy our meal and a group of people that appeared to be deciding on whether or not they should eat here, walked up and stopped for a minute to get a good look at what we were eating.\n\nThe free dinner was limited to certain selections but still some nice things to choose from. My wife had yellow squash soup as her appetizer with chicken marsala as her main course. I had the house salad and penne pomodoro for my main course. I know that's just pasta and tomato sauce but I had so much meat for breakfast that day I just wanted some good old fashioned carbs for dinner. Little did I know they would also bring us as much fresh bread and butter as we could eat.\n\nWe ordered a couple Peroni beers with our dinner and I found their beer prices to be better than most places on the strip.\n\nShe loved her soup and my salad was good and fresh but their house dressing was amazing. A sweet balsamic vinegarette. I should have asked if they sold it in a bottle. My wife said the chicken marsala was great and my pasta was a generous portion with fresh basil and chunks of tomato. A cup of good coffee was also included with the free meal.\n\nI noticed on the receipt that the price of the meal would have been pretty reasonable if we did not have free meal coupons. Will stop back again and try the lasagna!"
2,"Ok I hate doing this, but I wasnt wowed at all. \n\nI had never had rice pudding in my life so I didnt have any ideas of what it should taste like. \n\nThe rice pudding was very bland, I would actually never eat it again. \nThe dude in that day, was very very nice and helpful. I give the service 5 stars but the food 2 stars. \n\nAn example is I hate cupcakes but ate one at this place because I was starving, and I fell in love. \n\nThis place made me realize rice pudding is bland and not something I want to eat again\n\nit wasnt vomit enducing so thats good. but all in all not worth a trip. \n\nI was hoping for a new treat discovery. \n\nsomething else that was a turn off was the unsanitary looking plastic containers that look like tupperware they keep the pudding in. \n\nIf I could change one thing it would be that, i almost didnt eat there because it looked kinda gross. \n\nBut they get a 3 because i didnt want to puke and the service was good. \n\nMy girlfriend who loves rice pudding said it was bland and didnt eat half of the kids size. She said it was very average. \n\nI hope they make some changes and kick up the rice pudding, like try it colder or more flavorful?  \n\nsorry but i wont be back"
1,"It seems that there are brunch people that don't mind a bit of chaos, while there are also those that prefer a bit more structure/order.  LGO caters to the former, while I am a member of the latter group.  Blasting this place would be unfair, since it's just not my type of brunch place.\n\nObjectively speaking, there was a ton of people there and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Parking was an f-ing hassle, as others have expressed.  The kitchen was rocking it, though.  The dry goods and wine selection seemed worthwhile.  Can't comment on the food or coffee...it was all too much to deal with, and had to get the hell out of there before I could order anything.\n\nIf you don't mind the high-energy brunch scene, this place is probably pretty good.  If you do, you might want to skip it."
3,"I have some $10 off coupons to burn, so I stopped in today. I usually buy a glove but with the sale rack and a coupon I can get a shirt to shorts for 15 bucks or so. Good service and the staff is always cool. The customers are another story though, every time I'm there someone is trying to pull something on them. Today a guy had a return with someone else's credit card receipt, he insisted in cash back. What world does that work in?  Kudos to the staff for standing firm and not allowing cash back. They did offer store credit, of course he refused.  And you chops with trade in clubs - stop arguing over the value.  You paid $125 for used driver 5 years ago, and now you want $150 for it after putting idiot marks all over the top line and wore the grip down to the steel?  Get real.  4 stars for the store, 1 for most of the customers."
0,"I also found this place after leaving AMC.. I've been twice now.  If you caught me after my first visit you would have heard me rave about the food and the service.  The man that served us was friendly,  the service was exceptional and the food was spectacular!  I decided to take some friends next time I went and it was just the opposite.  The lady that served us brought 2 peoples food first leaving the third member of my party hungry, staring at our meals.  Then when the pasta missing entre finally arrived, after the other two people had already finished eating, it wasn't even what we ordered.  It was supposed to be spaghetti with meatballs but THERE WERENT ANY MEATBALLS! When we asked her why the meatballs were \""mia\"".. The waitress/cook replied that it was a misprint on the giant menu in the front of the store that you order from and it would be an additional charge if we wanted them.. So we waited another 20 minutes before we got what we ordered, missed the begining of our movie and ended up taking the food to gland gave it to a nice homeless man outside of the movie theater, leaving one person in our party to fill up on popcorn while we all tried to figure out what we missed on the movie.  \nI would go back.. But only if I see the owner working.  If the lady is there.. Don't bother stopping.. You'll regret it."
2,Went there last night. I love this restaurant but last night was not an amazing experience. Started off with drinks-the Asian pear sake tini  was not a drink I should have picked. Personally did not like. Shared 3 tapas and one maki. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing. The glazed ribs and shrimp tacos were very good. Got the sexy dragon it was good but not great. Ordered dessert which was the worst experience of the whole dinner. I ordered the apple empanada. It was horrible. Worst dessert I have every had in my life. The churros were good. I have had amazing desserts there before but this was so disappointing. Also the place was not packed and our waiter obviously did not want to be working and it came across in his service. I love this place but it was not a great experience. I will give it another try knowing what not to get next time.
4,"I've been meaning to review, and even started to on many occasions, and end up getting busy and not finishing however here it goes... Naga is amazing!!! The staff there are so nice and we have always had great service. We usually order take out but, on occasion, have eaten at the restaurant. The food always tastes fresh. \n\nAs a pescatarian (vegetarian that eats seafood), I'm so appreciative that they will make dishes meat free for me and forgo using chicken broth, etc. I have so many faves here; salad rolls, pad prik king, pad thai, spring rolls, crab rangoon, basically all their stir frys. I was so sad before Naga came to town, now I have great Thai in my backyard!  \n\nI tried another Thai restaurant down the street on a Monday when Naga was closed, it was horrible, learned my lesson... Naga reigns king!"
1,"I have been to this location 3 times now and the last visit was very disappointing. I really wanted to love this place but I am starting to think it is just overpriced and mediocre at best. They have no efficient process for ordering, the line backs up, and it just looks like everyone working is struggling to get it done. They should really have a check sheet for people to mark what they would like on their salads, it seems like people just stand in front of the glass forever deciding what they want which is super frustrating when you have to get back to work at lunchtime. When I finally did get to order I chose the Cobb salad and the chicken was soggy, tomatoes were mushy, bacon was stale, and the ranch dressing tasted like something out of a bottle. A salad place should always have homemade dressings and fresh chicken since most of their menu items feature chicken, especially at $9 a salad. Overall there are many other better restaurant options for the money."
3,"I am a total dinosaur when it comes to DVDs and CDs, granted yes, I have an iPod and so forth but there's nothing like that CD sound versus those compressed MP3s. Yes, I still buy DVDs but I am old fashioned, just picked up 4 for $10, so why not! The staff is always helpful and the prices are awesome."
4,"I came here for my 21st Birthday and put together a beer pairing menu for my guests ahead of time. Sage was entirely accommodating and provided absolutely impeccable service. The entire staff was welcoming and professional- I was exceedingly satisfied.\n\nTo begin with we were brought breads paired with supple butter and Australian sea salt- the sea salt was surprisingly a standout addition.\n______\nKusshi Oyster - My favorite of the night, don't miss out on these. Trust ME. Kusshi oysters are some of the best ones around.. incredible.\n\nPacific Yellowtail Crudo- A little bit creamy, but melt in your mouth delicious\n\nI also enjoyed a Glass of  Meursault, Joseph Drouhin, Burgundy (this white wine is phenomenal) & La Fin Dumonde - Perfect with the oysters, a light and refreshing pair\n\n__\nCharred Baby Octopus Caponata- Phenomenal highlight- if you even like octopus, you will Love this one.\n\nSlow-Poached Organic Farm Egg- rich and thick, slow poached perfection\n\nBeer:\nOrval Trappist Ale \nSchneider Aventinus\n\n__\n\nFor our main course we had the Salmon, which was done with classic elegance, a dish involving a type of Manta Ray- which I found to be lacking in flavor and moisture compared to the rest of the meal, and the Lamb Cheeks ( which I recommend ordering Rare -Med.Rare. My fiance liked it more well done but I really wasn't a fan) I drank their Cotes du Rhone Clos du Caillou and Chimay Grande Reserve. Both of these were expectedly excellent.\n\nWe enjoyed two desserts, but the Canelles de Bordeaux easily stole the show, with its waffle crispness and coconut ice cream.\nTripel Karmeliet was a perfect dessert Pairing & the Glass of P.J. Vlackenberg Eiswein, \""Madonna\"" for me as a little extra indulgence was slightly thicker and sweeter than I prefer, but wonderful all the same. Another guest of mine enjoyed the Sauternes from the menu which wasn't as smooth as I was expecting. \n\nEach of the beers had its own special glass in which to pour to bring out each beer's individual notes; as it should be- My guests were especially impressed when a cover for an entree was brought to the table when one of our guests wasn't present as entrees were served. \n\nEverything about this restaurant is phenomenal- from the ambiance down to the luxurious paper our bill was printed on. I could not have had a better experience."
4,"I asked my wife if we should give this place a five and she said,  \""unless we can give it a six!\"" From the minute you step into the lobby you begin living in the lap of luxury. The attentive service, the ambience, even the fragrance is wonderful. The setting is amazing.... at the foot of Camelback Mountain. And don't miss the 4 o'clock hour of joy in the lobby. Honestly we've been in more luxurious, newer or beautiful rooms... although the 1200 ft.\u00b2 suite easily held its own among the best...but it's pretty much impossible to find anything negative to say given the way these people take care of every detail and every minute of the day and night. Hats off to Starwood and the management of this property for taking care of your guests so well. Oh by the way, we are SPG Platinum and did receive a free upgrade to our suite. Thank you!!"
1,"everyone seems to hate this place,and i do now, but there was one day when i didnt. \n\nit was my first visit to phoenix and we could walk there from my moms new condo where everyone seemed to be a midwestern jew so i felt right at home. until i went out with a friend and saw more anorexy fake boobied blondes than i could imagine in any ryan reynolds movie. and NOOOO dive bars (next time im in town- youll all have to tell me where they are). actually there was one dive bar that was great, in a strip mall that had bar shuffle board.\n\nthe one and only day that i liked the bamboo club was the first time i got orange shrimp. it was fucking unreal. it was on this bed of crispy spinach with a mild orangey sauce and i LOVED it. every time ive been back we have gone here to get the orange shrimp and every time it has sucked more and more. the last time, in june, we went to the one in tempe and it was not only the worst service and coldest air conned mofo but that spinach was soggy. shameful. i wish i could take back my first time (not the first time ive said that) though i doubt i will ever learn that this place sucks shit now and will waste a meal every time i visit:("
2,"Nice enough furniture. Salesmen pretty friendly. Not the highest end furniture but as the saying goes, \""you get what you pay for\""."
2,"Brought a client here for lunch by her request. The restaurant is beautiful inside with traditional wood carvings and Thai art throughout. We were seated asap at a booth and I ordered Thai ice tea.\n\nOur waitress who was Thai seemed not want to be there since she was unfriendly and was just going thru the motions of servicing us. I went with the Thai red chicken curry. The entree came with a spring roll, soup and steam rice. The curry was actually tasty good and contained bamboo shoots and was spicy creamy. Our waitress brought the me the bill and I had to hit her up for offerings of dessert which happen to be only green tea ice cream. I ordered a serving and it was yummy but I only ate about half of it.\n\nIf not for the mediocore service by our waitress I would definitely return here again but it would problably be on my own to test the waters again. What a shame how a negative attitude can turn what should have been a above average experience into a below average rating."
0,"Food was Pretty good, beer was cold but service was shitty at best."
3,"Great Italian food. Could be a bit pricey for what you get at this restaurant. I ordered the lobster ravioli (which literally gives you like 8 pieces or something), and it was very good. \n\nI love pasta, and this place seems to cook it well. The bread isn't that bad here either. Great service too!\n\nI have been to the one in Santa Row in CA, and I feel that the vibe there is more elegant than this one (since this one is in the Fashion Mall). Bring your family here..."
4,They serve Horchata on a stick! \n\nWell its named Arroz con Leche but it brings the milky cinnamon goodness a horchata does for 3 bucks. Great little bits of rice and cinnamon too.\n\nA bit pricey but I think the quality and taste reflects that.
4,"This place is adorable, and the tables they have inside are filled almost every morning I stop in here. \n\nThe bagels are the best I have had in the state of Arizona!\n\nI used to frequent Kokibelli, however our office has recently moved and I needed to find a new bagel place.\n\nIt seems to be the only one in the area. \n\nThey offer Breakfast sandwiches as well as Lunch Sandwiches..Pitas and salads as well..\n\nThe service is great!\n\nMake sure to visit this place if you are in the area! \n\nIt is well worth the stop!\n\nI will be adding their menu as soon as our scanner is hooked up!"
4,"I have been approached in the parking lot going to my car many times. I told my husband I needed to learn a true self defense and quick. He said Krav Maga. I love it!!! It teaches you how to defend yourself from many different types of attacks right away. It also teaches you how to be aware,( which I thought I was), but now I really am. I have even taken my daughter as it designed for all ages and fitness levels.\n   The instructors are experienced and know how to walk you thru the techniques so you learn quickly you correctly. They are constantly learning and sometimes improving the  techniques for different situations as criminals keep learning different ways to attack. \n   I would highly recommend coming to a class and giving it a try, you just might learn something useful."
4,"Went to zoo last Saturday, it was very hot so we opted to ride the train the toured the whole zoo.  Since the zoo is only open till 2pm during the summer the train was a great time saver as well as cooler.  \nWe spent a lot of time at Stingray Bay, my child loves the stingrays. The worker there was awesome, she answered and all questions.  The zoo also has area's were kids of all ages can get wet and cooled off, believe me these spot were very popular!!\nOverall a awesome time as usual."
0,"Nickel and dime for everything,  too long of a boarding time (45minutes extra time of sitting on airplane is ridicules),  usually always some sort of departure delay (who cares if you can sometimes catch up in the air -  you still sit there from the time you boarded). Upgraded first seats not worth it especially when flight attendants are talking loud among themselves the entire time on overnight flights,  also loud banging from flight attendant coverts,  no respect for people trying to get some sleep(I had ear plugs and even this didn't help).    No heads up prior of flight regarding delays,  one time monitors didn't show the delays until scheduled departure time while gate stuff were announcing it over the Airport PR an hour early,  why not give this notice to arriving customers and update airport monitors so people don't have to rush to airport.   There are so many other things that are bothering me flying Spirit that I'm going to fly another airlines even when it's much higher cost."
2,"I have the Voir Restaurant Guide 2008. It tell it's a good restaurant, the location is good. etc. \n\nI went there with a friend with his new \u00abI only eat organic\u00bb Girlfriend.  Thought her hippy insight would appreciate the restaurant focus is organic food as well as all profits goes to organization. The concept is great and the Volountering Waiter, in a business Point of view was really good. We went there on a lousy monday night, restaurant was mostly empty. (bad weather). The place itself is great the decor is nice and there's definetely enough places for 80-100 persons. We get the menu and we're automatically told some thing on the menu are missing. Better now then later I Guess, but never a good thing. I've gotten a pea soup and a duck springroll with a little salad. The taste was pretty good for the roll but the others and the other at the table we merely satisfied by their meal. Plain seasam oiled carrot salad. Really Boring and if didn't have the masserated taste of a good carrot salad. The World Cooking was to be understood especially with the theme of giving out profits but in my opinion, if you can't do world food properly just don't do it and stick to what you know. So basically, I felt the amateur way the restaurant was being manage and even though I did felt it was for a good cause, I'd rather give 100$ to a non-profit diner where it is manage by professional and paid staff. \n\nOverall, good price, ok service, so-so food."
3,"Very cool place to sit at the bar and grab a few drinks.  All of the bartenders I've met have been great to chat with, and it seems like there are always a few regulars at the bar when I stop by.  The last time I was there my buddy and I sat at the bar and were immediately given vodka gummi bears for a going away party.  Don't mind if I do!  When you sit at the bar there is no reason for you to not feel welcome here.\n\nDrink prices are very reasonable.  For three rounds of drinks for two people, our bill came out to $21.  Not sure if it's always available, but they had $3 bottles of Lagunitas Lil Sumpin and $3 of Rogue on special.  If drinking isn't enough to keep you entertained, there's a jukebox, pool table, electronic dart board, and Deer Hunter.\n\nCheap drinks, good hospitality and games make this an easy choice to either start or end your night.  If your bartender is Mario, tell him T-Bone and Carl sent you.  It won't get you anything special, but he'll know who sent you."
1,This place is for the adventurous folk. It is not very clean and the service fluctuate from average to poor. They served a very generous portion but I rather that it be taste good than big. The hot & sour soup tasted like it is been simmering on a hot plate for a while and the soup is watery.
1,We got there at 8:11 and didn't leave until 10:30 because it took the waiter at least 5 times to get Everyones order right. It took probably until almost 10:00 for everyone to get their food. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because the sushi was great and I got it after a reasonable amount of time. I would only go back here to sit at the sushi bar because they were good and the sushi chefs looked like a good time to have conversations while you eat.
3,"The Treehouse Cafe claims to make the best flatwhite in town, and while I don't quite believe that, they do serve up a tasty drop with some of the best coffee art I've ever seen in Edinburgh. They also make a delicious panini/sandwich with a selection of creative fillings, and serve it with a couple of freshly made salads straight from their deli counter. This place will keep your tastebuds interested. All this, and served with a smile. The staff are wonderful!"
3,"I love this place and live nearby so I go a lot! It's a great place of you want good cheap food. I thought it was too good to be true when everything on the menu was about $5 but the Thai iced tea, potstickers, basil rice, and orange chicken are delicious. Gave it only four starts because not everything is delicious... Good... Just not delicious, but for $5 not bad. Our favorite thing to do is buy the party size potstickers... 40 for $25."
3,"I've always seen this restaurant while shopping in the forum shops.\nAfter a recommendation from a worker at LV, we ecided to give it a try.\n\nThe service: the staff were very professional and knew the menu backwards and forwards. They knew what to recommend, and they were right. \nThe food: Crab cakes for appetizer - ding ding ding! delicious, and not at all fishy.\nThen came the salad : delicious and fresh! I've tried several of their salads, and I have yet to be disappointed. The bisque is fail-proof as well. \nThen, the pasta. It was cooked to perfection and was seasoned well. \n\nI have yet to dry dessert from here.\nI always end up stuffing myself with the entrees, that by the time dessert menu rolls around... I am ready to roll around and go to bed. LOL"
3,Mein Kumpel hat in dem Geb\u00e4ude nebendran gewohnt und deshalb haben wir immer dort unsere Pizza bestellt und diese dann abgeholt! \nGing immer sehr schnell! \nCalzone war sehr lecker! Thunfischsalat und dazu Pizzabrot auch! \nPreislich finde ich den Laden auch in Ordnung! Lieferzeit kann ich nicht beurteilen.
2,"I ended up in the northwest yesterday running some errands and decided to do some shopping nearby.  Before hitting the freeway, I stopped at this Starbucks for a quick drink.\n\nThere was only one car at the drive through.  I ordered my drink, waited a reasonable amount of time, and then was on my way.  The register critter was pleasant and the quad espresso was Starbucks to the core.\n\nThe place is OK, but I'm not here very often.  It's also one of the most inconvenient places to get in and out.  I think that of the entire Centennial Center."
2,This is one of the better Pho joints among the many scattered on Spring Mountain Road. Super casual and decent service. Note: They take CASH ONLY.
1,"Ate there Dec 29th.  Had Idaho Trout, Salmon, Rack of ribs, tendorloin and artichokes.\n\nBoth fish were uneventful, pretty bland...expensive, I have had much better for the price.  Ribs, little meat and tasted like they boiled them before they were grilled, no flavor other than some pretty lame BBQ sauce.  Tendorloin was undercooked and tough, again little flavor.  Artichokes were pretty good, cut in half and grilled seasoned very nicely.\n\nIn summary, expensive, wine list is nothing to get very excited about and like everything else expensive for what you get.  Thought we were supposed to get bread and didn't, service was OK, albeit slow at times.  Think I will wait for sometime before going back, maybe it will get better, if not they won't be around very long."
0,"The staff was not friendly at all and it is greatly overpriced, even for an airport. I waited in line and asked the lady what soups they had, she had to look into the pots and asked another worker. I stated I'd like to order the ham and swiss and she asked if I waited in line?! She saw me waiting like everyone else! The other worker ensured her I did. I tried not to let it get to me and I proceeded to finish my order with clam chowder and a bottle of water. She ran my card and I asked if I could also get a cup of hot water. They wanted to charge me  $2.88 for the cup?!?! I just spent over $20 here!! I'd understand if I didn't buy anything else and just wanted hot water but seriously?! How greedy is this company?? Not a great start to a busy schedule ahead of me."
4,Such a different experience from all the buffets in town.  Ate here with a couple of girlfriends for a bachelorette party.  The food was fantastic and so was the service.  We sat at the bar and asked the chef to surprise us - he did not disappoint.
4,"Great company and they give back to the community!\n\nDelicious and affordable, so happy to have them in Scottsdale, AZ."
3,Came here to see the new Circus Ole show and dinner.  The hotel and casino are one of the most modern on the strip and the ambiance is quite striking.   And all this at a price of course !!!  Very nice to stop in at but perhaps to spend any significant time you might consider it a place for special occasions !!!
0,"I've never skipped a tip in my life, but the service at Chez-Doval was intentionally disrespectful and quite unacceptable. On the up side, they did have really excellent grilled chicken and grilled squid. \n\nHe was clearly bothered that we didn't order 2 entrees. Our 1 Grilled Chicken entree and grilled squid appetizer was more than enough food for the two of us. We even ordered a half-litre of wine. We were very full and satisfied with the food! \n\nOne star: \nHe forgot to bring the wine before the food, then finally came around after we finished eating. We had to ask about dessert, which was \""already put away\"" and unavailable at 9:30.  He deliberately refused to come back to collect our credit card for payment for almost 20min after delivering the check. We were long past ready-to-go, so we had to just forget about the tip and leave barley enough cash for the bill on the table before walking out."
0,"Horrible customer service experience; couldn't even get past the receptionist. Refused verified insurance coverage, inaccurate cash pricing, poor attitude. Overall an underwhelming and less than positive experience."
2,"Nothin' special..just a good option when looking for a place to eat in the airport.  \nI was feeling cheap and not that hungry when I decided to stop in here, and went for their soup ($5ish).  A generous, hot serviing of Soutwest tortilla soup hit the spot and carried me over on my trip."
1,"So sad to have to give Sedona a bad review, especially since this is my first yelp review ever.  This has been one of our regular spots for the past couple years and used to be a favorite. They recently changed the menu and I'm not sure if they got a new chef as well, but our faves were gone and the stuff we ordered was bland. I used to crave the tomato soup with grilled cheese, but alas, that's off the menu...instead I got  the chicken consomm\u00e9 with dumplings which didn't even come close. I had to ask for salt which I pretty much never use in restaurants. I also got the ahi lettuce wraps which were disappointing. The bf got the chopped salad he's ordered a million times before and even that was pretty flavorless. The only good thing we had were the fries. So strange, perhaps they were just having an off night. I'm hoping this is just the summer menu and it goes back to \""normal\"" in a couple months because I'm really going to miss that tomato soup!!!"
3,"I love this place!  The room deals are great, 550 sq. ft room, 20+ dining opinions ranging from elegant to fast food.  The Orleans is 5 mins from the strip.  Really easy to get on and off the interstate hwy.  Valet parking is quick, self parking is ample, and they have Fat Tire Ale on tap.  \n\nI need to book a trip to Vegas. . . ."
0,"This was a horrible experience in the drive thru. Cars parked in line with their engines off. 4 Staff members playing inside store. The only person that was actually working was the guy on skates. 30min stuck in line, burnt food, cold food & horrible service."
2,"Lin's is a great place to go once or twice a year when you are just craving 1000 pounds of questionable americanized Chinese food.\n\nThis place is like your classic mall Chinese food, but done pretty well. I've been twice and there's always lots of food, it's usually hot and reasonably fresh, and the service is above average considering how busy it is.  The prices are reasonable--dinner is $10.69. \n\nAlso, I am embarrassed to say it, but the buffalo wings are way good.\n\nWhy the three stars? Two reasons...\n\nFirst, the customer base here is really... interesting. It's kind of like eating while sitting on the floor of an inner city Walmart. There are children running around everywhere, most of whom are poorly dressed. When I went a couple nights ago, I saw a fat 9 yr old boy with a \""YOU SUCK\"" t-shirt on, and another kid about 5 yrs old with skull and crossbones logos all over his baggy sweatshirt. To be fair, most of the older clientele are just regular fat guys grubbing out at the ol' buffet, but a fair number of the customers here just exude a lack of class. Lin's has a huge pump bottle of A1 near the \""steak\"" area. I mean really... if it's under the guise of Chinese buffet, they sure aren't trying very hard.\n\nSecond, for some reason there is this intense sense of discomfort associated with being at Lin's that I can't really explain, like you just want to scarf down all your food as fast as you can and get the hell out of there. I think it's mostly caused by the crowdedness everywhere. The chairs are pretty close to each other, the people at the buffet seem ravenous and you always have to be careful to not bump into Big Momma behind you who is snatching up all the crawfish, corn on the cob and french fries she can. Nobody goes here for the atmosphere, and usually I don't care at all about things like this, but here it's extreme and you feel very rushed.\n\nI'll go back the next time I have no regard for my health or happiness and just need to gorge myself on cheap food, because the food really isn't too bad, but I would not make Lin's a regular on my list."
2,"Food and wine were great as always, but the service left something to be desired. We were greeted and served quickly, but then our wine and water ran out and no one checked on us or removed the dishes. When we did finally get a chance to order more wine the server ran off without asking what we wanted. I guess she assumed we wanted to stick with the wine we started with, but we didn't. Dishes were not very clean. All around disappointing trip this time."
0,"Been to other Capriottis in town & this favors the least. My order is always the same & have received it consistently in other locations. My large Philly Cheese Steak did not look like a large at all. It looked deflated, squished, lacked meat and cheese. Other locations are extremely generous, taking pride in their sandwiches. This one seems to not do so. Sandwich should be divine if I'm paying $9 for it. Just saying."
1,"I'm really not a fan of this place. The interior is outdated and gave me the feeling that the place should be steam cleaned. The tables weren't very comfortable either. \n\nThe menu had a good number of options, especially if you are a big lamb-eater (which I am not). \n\nDesserts were pretty good and maybe worth visiting for, however the main course was worth passing."
4,"Just came in for lunch today, and had a great time. Wonderful, friendly service, and the hummus was yummy to boot. Had a lovely conversation with the bartender, Serena, and can't wait to come back again."
3,"Volcano Nachos. Get these and you will be happy. I finished it between me and my gf, but it could have easily been shared with 3 or 4. Ridiculous. Margaritas are ok, I got the big Rita I think, and it came with a nice cup to take home. Nice and loud.. rowdy ambiance. I liked it a lot. \n\nPlus they had pirates, lifeguards, and seamen (oh yeah) walking around on stilts making balloons. We got a shark and flower hat.. pretty weak.. should have gotten the animal or viking hat.\n\nOh and a tip... the bar is first come first serve seating.. so go and camp out some tables and don't wait in line like the other chumps."
2,Great atmosphere but the food and drinks are overpriced for what they are.
4,Luckily we checked Yelp as the main road bypasses 'old' Wickenburg.  We started with the fried bacon wrapped chiles stuffed with shrimp.  Very spicy but so delicious!  I didn't realize how big the appetizer was!  I was full after a bowl of their warm chips and the appetizer!  The chips were served with bean dip and two salsas (one which was on yummy fire)  I only was able to take a couple bites of my chile verde.  It was full of flavor!  It was delicious on my scrambled eggs then next morning.  Our server was friendly and attentive.
2,Pretty good. Nothing to shout about. Alright breakfast but it's not a restaurant you'd be clamouring for. It's decent
4,"Great place, i stop by from time to time, really friendly staff and a great DJ on friday and saturday nights!"
2,"Ate here for a late dinner. Service was spot on. Our server was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and had a sweet moustache.\nThe food was alright, we were not blown away by our entrees, but I think we ordered the wrong items. \nPerhaps we'll come back and not be so drunk from pool partying and might be able to appreciate the toned down Italian cuisine with all natural locally farmed ingredients."
1,Well..my fiance put it best as we were walking out.  It was like a very expensive freak show.  I love Cirque's and really liked the idea of one that would push the envelope a little.  But for the money...it really falls flat.\n\nWe made the mistake of going to Le Reve first...and that was so unbelievably amazing..that it probably soured us a little here.
1,"Since we had some time to kill before a show and we were staying at the Vdara, we decided to give their only eatery a try. I really had no expectations at all, other than it would probably be overpriced.\n\nWe tried the ramen soup and the chicken tacos. The chicken tacos were sweet, not too bad, but after a while the flavor was not entirely welcome. They came accompanied by chips and salsa - chopping tomatoes very finely, does not a salsa make. It was utterly flavorless...and the chips were kinda stale.\n\nThe ramen (topped with pork and a poached egg) was really gross in my opinion. There was no real flavor, but the flavors that were there were not good. I did not try any of the pork that came in the dish, but my husband did and promptly proclaimed that it was gross.\n\nThe portions are pretty big for the approx. $14 dollars you pay per dish, but the food is not worth it. They also took a while to bring our food out, despite the fact that the place was pretty much empty.\n\nOh, we also had dessert...as you can see...they were forgettable.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this place. There are other cheap places that will do a better job at filling your tummy."
3,"I think one's experience with any post office depends on the time of day you go. Having it be crowded during the Christmas season compared to 1:40p in the afternoon in mid January will be two different experiences. I must say I have been pleased with my visits thus far. \n\nStaff at the counter have been helpful and try not to rush you. That is great, except when there is a longer line. Great service can slow down the waiting time. Nice clean facility, stocked up nicely with shopping supplies. All in all, 4 stars."
0,"Watch out! The \""Buffet of Buffets\"" isn't a single place, or a chain of identical places -- it's a collection of 6 different buffet-style restaurants on the Strip. It seems to be pushed as a package deal with hotel offers (e.g., get a room for 2 nights and get vouchers for 2 meals at any of the 6 buffets). If it were up to me, Buffet of Buffets wouldn't get a listing on Yelp at all -- only the individual restaurants would.\n\nIf you go to the address listed here for Buffet of Buffets, you'll be at Harrah's, and the buffet there is called Flavors. As I write, Buffet of Buffets has a 4.5 star rating here on Yelp, which piqued my interest; but after going to the address listed and finding out it's just Flavors (and trying Flavors -- see my 1-star review @ http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:B2-LbPrmCSBbpjpMAnHAZA), I really wish I hadn't been tricked by the Yelp listing into thinking I was going to get a nice meal.\n\nCaveat emptor."
2,"Stopped by for lunch and was greeted by great-looking focaccia coming out of the oven. Based on that view, I decided to have the eggplant foccacia. It came with homemade Italian wedding soup, which was good with fresh veggies.  It also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping-- excellent!  The eggplant was good, but honestly, the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.  \nThe waitress was friendly in a casual way, and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary.  I will try something else next time, as it is worth a return visit!"
1,"Eating here made me miss Miami big time. Saturday at lunch it was pretty busy with an all-Hispanic crowd (I think more Central American than Peruvian) with lots of kids eating chicken and french fries everywhere.\n\nBut I came for the Ceviche, and that's what I ordered. Ceviche mixto $14.50 (South Beach prices on S. Polk street?) medium spicy please\n\nThe traditional complimentary basket with fried  pan de Yuca was served quickly - if you're not familiar with it the best way I can describe it is like fried dough, like a sugarless beignet with yellow chili sauce to dip it in.  \n\nBad start, the dough was chewy, greasy, lukewarm, old ... in a word awful - I didn't subtract a star because after all it's a freebie.\n\nCeviche is supposed to be as freshly made as possible, in fact the better restaurants prepare it only after you order. Here it had been sitting the fridge for days. The fish was mealy, the shrimp had the consistency of an overcooked limp noodle, the calamare and octopus was harder than leather, even the leaf of lettuce it was served on was the most wilted lettuce I've ever seen. Even the potatoes were old, I couldn't even recognize the taste of the sweet potato and had to ask if indeed that's it was. And the medium was very mild. \n\nI'm awarding it 2 stars because the Tigre de Leche sauce was pretty good - not great - and someone could  eat a meal here and enjoy if they're not picky.\n\nNo way that this type was an isolated incident, just by looking at the photos of the Jalea here: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gkmZl8WuIzVUGBLCbOIVSA/l.jpg   you can tell it was fried to death. \n\nAt Machu Picchu the bar is set really low."
4,"These guys are living the American dream.  They are experienced and certified pool guys who have started their own business and are doing a great job.  Very friendly and all in all, great guys.  They let themselves in and out without bothering, have a regular time so we know to expect them, and let us know when if there are any issues.  And... the pool looks as good as it ever has."
3,"On weekdays, bring the whole family and have a blast! Make sure you use sunscreen and reapply twice while you're on the river! Pack your cooler with some beers, plenty of water, some sandwiches and snacks and you're good to go. It's also super fun to bring a bag of marshmallows to toss at fellow tubers (it's all in good fun, and they'll throw them back at you). We saw wild horses and had really fun interactions with other people :) On weekends, do not bring your children!!!! It is a drunken mess, of both people and litter in the water. Fun if you're young and have a designated driver."
0,This place is closed. Sign says coming soon Detroit Coney Grill
2,"My sandwich was fine. The spicy meat sauce was a little runny, but the flavor was pretty good. Tried three different kinds of meatballs on my sandwich and figured I probably wouldn't even be able to tell the difference, but I could. They were all good, but I liked the classic one best. The bread was nice and soft, but didn't fall apart. \n\nThey charged a buck extra for some mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese, I thought that was kind of ridiculous, but the sandwich and drink weren't expensive by Vegas shopping mall food court standards, and it was plenty to eat."
3,Wicked tasty! Meatballs for appetizers were awesome. Then two different pizzas.... Thumbs up!
1,"I also had very high expectations for this place, went with my friend John, and we both agreed our appetizer could've been better... we had the fried tofu in miso soup, and it is an odd idea to begin with, because fried anything will get soggy after been bathed in miso soup! so we are not fans\nI then ordered the Hakata Ramen, it was ok, again nothing special whatsoever, i needed to add a lot of hot sauce"
4,"Possibly the greatest store ever.\n\nFarm & Fleet is the only place in CU that sells fasteners by the pound.  You can get four 3/8\"" nuts at Menards or Lowe's in a little plastic bag for $0.99 or you can get ONE POUND of them in bulk at Farm & Fleet for $1.50.\n\nBeen coming here all my life.  Walking through the front door still sends a little quiver up my leg.  Just as it always has."
4,The ONLY place I buy pizza in Fountain Hills!\n\nHOT-n-READY $5.00 pizza or hot wings...
4,I was looking to sell my home but did not know any Real estate agents and that is when I started searching online.  \n\nI had sent many emails contacting different agents but Connie was the first person to get back to me. She is full of enthusiasm and makes things fun.  Her attention to detail is highly commended and is one of the best real estate agents in Las Vegas.
2,"This review concerns the poker room and the pai gow tables; I did not stay at the hotel.  The staff at the poker room was nice, but they did not have a game going in the middle of the day on a Sunday.  Eventually one started, but come on, run some promotions or something to make sure you at least have one table going in the middle of the day on a weekend.  The pai gow dealers were very nice and I had no problem getting a seat while waiting for a poker table to open."
4,"Love going to their \""all you can eat\"" sushi dinner. At only $26 it is affordable and super yummy. The staff is super nice and the facility is clean. It always seems to be a bit slow, but I usually go around 5pm."
3,"I am very saddened by the fact that they have moved locations. This was a great and convenient location for my commute home from work. I'll be stopping in every now and then at the new location but I'll be missing my (almost) weekly stop. \n\n\n\nVery friendly and welcoming staff members coupled with a nice indoor and patio dining area make for a very enjoyable dining experience.\n\nThe food is very reasonably priced and delicious. The portion sizes are a little smaller than I am used to, but preferred to the unnecessarily huge portions found at other nearby Mexican restaurants.\n\nI would highly recommend the carne asada torta sandwich. I tried it after reading another user's review and I was not disappointed. The horchata is also some of the best I've had in town.\n\nI have never enjoyed their happy hour specials but it seems like great deal with Mexican beers available for just $2."
3,"Stayed for three nights to celebrate NYE in Montreal!  Check-in was easy and we were pumped to find out there was a safe, indoor (heated) parking lot half a block away for $12 a day.  Our room was clean and had everything we needed.  Perfect location to the metro and centrally located to lots of fun spots.  Everyone was super nice too.  \n\nMinor issue with a running toilet, but oh well.  And in typical hostel fashion, there was a bit of noise throughout the night as people got back from a night out.  \n\nBreakfast was toast, waffles, muffins, croissants, and hard-boiled eggs.  Coffee & juice too.  Ends at 10am. \n\nWould definitely stay here again!"
3,One of the largest Post Offices in the area and a great group!
4,LOVE the trampoline classes!! I look forward to the workouts every time and I leave feeling that I got a great workout every time. The staffs energy is very positive and encouraging. With this studio their maybe hope for me getting in shape after all
0,"I bought a safety fence and gate a month ago, still have no fence. I ordered it, waited, and was so dissatisfied. I am so glad I inspected the gate. Had I not, I would have had to pay a restocking fee. Upon opening the box, or should I say after I saw the box opened by the manager before I got there, I found the mesh was ripped. If I wanted a new one after I left the store I would have had to pay. I then handed it back and said please get me one that is not ripped, how long do I have to wait? I ordered this deal a month ago and still have nothing. I ordered the fence because I have a need, not just because. The manager Katherine has lost her attitude at this point, but it is too late. I called corporate to complain and get something going, but all they did was call the store and have Katherine call me, who did and asked why we called corporate. I cannot imagine how a company so poorly run could be so big. I know, ripping people off. They are the only ones who carry this fence so I am stuck. GO TO NPS PEOPLE!!!!!!!!"
0,"I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS!!!! I wish my two bridesmaids who went here would have done their research because this has been a nightmare!!!! First off the dresses were ordered nearly 9 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago my bridesmaids were told the dresses were \""lost\"" they kept blaming Alfred Angelo even though Alfred Angelo said the dresses were already shipped. So for 3 weeks after going back and forth with the dumb manager and whoever else works there my fiance had to take over and forced the owner to give him the UPS tracking number... after looking at the activity with the tracking number it turns out the dresses were NOT lost but had been attempted to be delivered 3 different times but every time they tried to deliver them the store did not have the payment for the delivery even though the dresses were paid in full already!! I am so angry and so confused as to how a company can function and stay open like this! They are so unhelpful and rude! Supposedly tonight the manager is going to the UPS hub to pick up the dresses so my bridesmaids can pick them up tomorrow.. with my wedding less than 3 weeks away I sure hope this is true! I will believe it when I see it. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"I got pulled into this tourist trap thanks to groupon and out of town family visiting. I didn't have high hopes for this place...I just figured it was your typical Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock Cafe style eateries. And I was pretty close. The decor is mostly motorcycle themed with some nascar memorabilia around. \n\nWe were immediately seated (6 pm on a Wednesday) but we waited for a while to be greeted by our server. When we were finally greeted, our server was quick to get out drinks and move onto the next table.  But she was informative on the menu selections and offered up what would be great suggestions. \n\nThe food came out relatively soon and looked up the par. I opted for the chicken club which tasted like it has been microwaved and between the others at the table, there was the meatloaf, kids chicken and the bbq plate for 2. We also had a 23oz beer in a souvenir glass and a mixed drink in a souvenir glass. The drinks and food were good overall but not a place I would frequent. And I probably wouldn't jump at the opportunity to bring more out of town family back here.  \n\nOne of the perks of dining here is that there is a parking garage right behind the restaurant that once you pay the $10 parking fee, you get a voucher that takes the $10 off of your bill."
3,Went looking for cleaning products but didn't buy any because it was junk. Stuff that falls apart and one time use items. Also the prices were no different then a grocery stores.  They do have quick pick up items that are not bad if you don't want the congestion of a large grocery store place.
4,"We had a ball here. Brad Garrett has this theater named for him in the \""basement\"" of the MGM Grand. If you can't place the name, Brad Garrett was Ray Romano's older brother in the TV show, Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nHe doesn't perform every night, but we chose a night he would be there. He is hysterical - very off-color, so be warned and try to stay out of the front row. If you are in the front row, you're a target. He does offer consolation to the folks he abuses at the end by giving them t-shirts and hats from his show.\n\nThere were two other comedians that also performed. Both have been on late night TV shows, but he overshadowed them tremendously.\n\nAs for the theater, it was very nice. It is not set up like a traditional theater, but more like a night club. There are tables and booths adding more ambiance. The service was wonderful, and the prices were reasonable for being a theater in a hotel. We both enjoyed a couple of drinks (one on the house). We left happy and laughing!"
4,"This review is on the cupcakes.  I am no culinary expert, I am no desert chef, but darn it, these were good.  And everyone in the office liked them as well.\n\nThe chef is very sweet, the cafe is nice.  They serve espresso here for all of you that didn't know.  I will be back for the cakes!"
2,this place is nice and more family oriented! The complex is very nice! Its away from the strip. It cost us about $30.00 to get to the strip but this resort does provide a shuttle to the strip if you like to go that route. I don't own a time share but if I did own a time share here I would be disappointed it can use some updating like flat screen TVs it still has old TVs.  Its located right next door to the southpoint casino so that was a + if you have children this place is a good place to stay since I did see children at the pool and they have a bowling alley & movies theater at southpoint!\nI love to party so I probably will not stay here again I like to hit the pool parties on the strip and be all up in the mix of the crowds!!!
3,"I've lived in Vegas for 9 years. For some reason, I had not made it over here until recently. I've been to most of the well known dive bars and pubs around town. This place has a solid beer selection. The staff is very friendly. Adam is very cool and makes you feel nice and relaxed. The vibe is always upbeat and chill. The food is very tasty! If I had to complain about anything(it's a small one)...it would be the need for a few more upper end craft beers. They have a solid selection...but with the addition of a few more Belgians or sours and it would be great!"
1,"We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much, you can't help but have big expectations. We were disappointed...\n\nHere's the thing, when you sit down at a restaurant and the table is filthy, the menus have food all over them, and they bring your drinks in Solo cups...Without a doubt, if I were still in college and needed to nurse a hangover, this would probably be a go-to place. \n\nMy husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the \""vegetarian\"" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat. Although we were dining there, the salad came in a plastic to-go box and pre-packaged dressing in a packet. The chicken was like tasteless rubber. \n\nWe checked of the \""Primanti Bros\"" box, but won't be back."
2,"I tried this place for the first time tonight.  Ordered online, which was simple and had multiple options to customize the sandwich.  The service was less than stellar.  I was greeted when I walked in, stood at the ordered online register to finally have someone ask if I was Lisa and just stand in front of me with a bag.  I had to ask for a cup and if I could pick out my chips.  The sub was pretty good, Italian sub, flavorful and tasty.  Despite the service I will visit again."
4,"Where else can you get a truly classy interior,REAL artwork that is for sale and then awesome bartenders who know your name. Be ready to kick back with city leaders,news people,attorneys,hipsters and small business owners who call downtown home. This is the new heart of the city where people will talk about \""so and so used to hangout there\"". It's hard to find, but once you find it, you won't want to leave."
3,"Sambalatte is defnitely the heart of the (Summer)'Lin!  It's a trendy and hip place to hang out.  They've definitely designed the place to be friendly for patrons to hang out because they have laptop friendly tables with outlets and lots of seating inside, outside and in nooks and crannies.\n\nThe coffee:\nThe nutella latte are hot chocolate/chocochino (?) are tasty!\n\nTip:  Look out on weekends when everyone and their mom is looking to \njoin in on the sambalatte fun.\n\nConclusion:  Hip and trendy coffeehouse good for parking your bum."
4,Loved this place!!!! You MUST visit this place when your in vegas!!
1,"It sounds like many of the positive reviews are from the lunch goers. Unfortunately, I had dinner here with the wife and quickly realized we made a mistake. When in Vegas, you have an abundance of outstanding culinary choices and we settled on Ocean One after a long day of shopping and we were just passing by and thought let's just grab something here. Shoulda kept walkin.\n\nOur server was kinda funny, though. He looked like a kid and was probably a foreign exchange student or something. Instead of waiting on us, he watched World Series of Poker on the TV. \n\nTheir 2-for-1 drink special is like any other drink special scam on the strip. Small glass and almost no alcohol. I got my 2nd one to go and it came in a kids cup.\n\nMy wife ordered a pizza. The pizzas look impressive. Looks can be deceiving. Had the basil and artichoke....and cheese. Lotsa cheese. The pizza was like a heap of cheese, shreds of old basil, and canned artichoke hearts on one huge cracker separated by the thinnest layer of ricotta cheese. Bleh.\n\nWhile writing this review, I forgot what I ordered. I think it was a chicken greek salad. The chicken was meager and the flavor was greek to me.\n\nPass."
3,"The Birthday Cake Castle is now open for tours.  Having grown up in Phoenix and just down the street from the castle I had many grandios ideas about the castle.  I was fortunate enough to tour the castle this year when it opened.  It is a great tour, however it is my reservation only.  Call now for a tour next year as they are booked up through the year.  It is a must see tour when coming to the valley."
3,"Pretty good! They have many vegan options if you ask! Waitstaff is friendly. My friend ordered the chicken marsala, but said there was too much fat on it. I ordered the garlic noodle dish, minus the shrimp. Even the half-order at $5 was too generous a helping, but sooo very good. There were approximately 15 other people at our table, as it was a friend's birthday dinner, and everything looked phenomenal, really. I'd definitely like to go back often if I wasn't so distant from chandler!"
2,"Pretty good Chinese food, and they deliver in area (our only other option is pizza). \nI really like their egg rolls and wanton soup. My partner usually gets the orange chicken but she says she likes the kind from panda express better. \nI would give them another star but delivery is always 45 minutes and they are never able to take a credit/debit card for the last 6 months."
0,Has to be one of the worst drive thru I have been too on a Sunday night Around 9pm it took me 35 min yes you heard correctly 35 min to get some tacos the drive thru only had 5 cars in front of me too that's the worst part
3,A nice quiet airport with plenty of shopping. The womens restroom has a bathroom attendant and is very clean
2,"Decent place for cheap fun. I would never specifically go here for a night out. Rockhouse is more like the type of place that you always walk by on the strip. Most of the time, you don't go in. But every now and then, you decide to give it a try and you end up with a nice diversion.\n\nThat's what happened to my cousins and me on Christmas Day. As we walked by, they told us it was free entry and open bar for the next hour. Come to think of it, I don't think they ever charge a cover to get in, but the open bar appealed to us. We had just come from The Chandelier and Mandarin Bar, so we figured we would balance the night out with a little dive bar style action. Even with the open bar, the place didn't attract a ton of people. We ended up just sitting there, drinking a couple of concoctions, and then leaving.\n\nLike I said, it's a nice little diversion."
0,"This was my third visit since this summer. The theater is in a beautiful mall called Town Square. The concession stand, restrooms and theater have no standards for cleanliness. I assumed the first visit was just one of those days but the second and third time is no excuse. I second guessed purchasing anything from the concession stand. Looked like a health hazard. The restroom looked and smelled like it hasn't been cleaned or restocked since my first visit in June. The theater we were told would not be ready for another 10 minutes for cleaning only to find popcorn in the seats and scattered on the floor. I would hate to see what it really looks like with the lights on. I wanted to burn my shoes when I got home. Shame on the management for allowing low level standards."
0,"DON'T ORDER THEIR DRINKS!!!!\n\nA basic house margarita at this place costs $15.18 and there are no prices on the menu.  We were shocked when we received the bill and were told that this was indeed the standard price and not a mistake.  After complaining to the supervisor about their unethical practices she was ambivalent and basically told me she was powerless to make it right and to talk to call the corporate office to complain.  \n\nI feel sorry for the nice waitress or anyone else working here as they are forbidden \""by restaurant policy\"" to warn customers who don't ask about the price of a standard drink."
2,"Came around noon with three other friends on a Saturday.  Guess we beat the rush because we were seated right away.  The service is nice when the waitress is at your table, but for a place that wasn't so busy, I'd say it was a little spotty.  What was exceptional, however, was that when we ordered our Salted Caramel (spiked with Bourbon) shake and said we'd share it, the waitress automatically brought it out in two glasses, which was thoughtful. \n\nIn terms of the burgers though...My friend and I got a Shrooms  (mushrooms, brie, caramelized onion) burger and a Double Yoi (pastrami, egg, swiss cheese, slaw) to share.  The burgers are super oily and unfortunately, the beef patties seemed so sadly underseasoned.  It was so so so underseasoned that the burger probably would've been just as good without the patties.  Sad.  The Shrooms came out on top though- the Double Yoi ended up being really heavy, even with the slaw.  I liked the ideas behind the burgers, but felt that the execution wasn't so great. \n\nThe fries are pretty bomb though, so if you come, get some for the table to share."
1,Not that bad it was alright. Nothing too special from all the other hotels. Wish the rooms were a bit brighter in color but not like i stayed in the room alot anyways.
3,"Cash is king at this cavernous, dusty Rockabilly Theater. Or Bar. Or Club. Or whatever.\n\nBathrooms are drafty, at least the ladies', since its basically an ad-hoc shed propped against the back wall (awesome), like an indoor outhouse. A mix of brand-new beer and race signage is mixed with some rustier relics - car hoods, old clocks (the only one accurately telling time is the one behind the bar to the left), old taps (funnily, the tap collection lining the soundbooth dwarfs their actual draft choices of Bud Light or Bud Light). I stick to the (2 dolla) tallboys or the high life. Cheers.\n\nThere's a 6 foot tall rebel flag a-gracing the backstage. The lights make it glow bright red. Snacks consist of Fritos and Doritos in the tiny bags.\n\nMake the drive on the weekends and its eye candy - shelf tops, huge eyelashes, red lipstick, leopard print, bouffants and tightly cuffed jeans. I don't know much about the 'billy kids these days but I know a handsome crowd when I see one. Wide age range. People seemed friendly even though I looked a schlub by comparison in my old T and sweater.\n\nBut the bluegrass nights are the bigger draw for me, on the 2nd and 3rd Wednesdays of every month. No cover, just a tip jar made out of an old pegleg standing on the stage. Good, long sets. Kinda empty, so it's echoey and peaceful. Sweet."
4,"After the buzz on this dude, I had to check him out. All I can say is get there before he moves to a much more expensive room down the strip. IMHO He will soon demand a much higher ticket price at one of the fancy schmancy casinos in the Central Strip area. He is beyond talented and so is his band. I think he could outshine Michael Buble' down the road.\nThis is the same showroom that Danny Gans started his ascent in and it is a roomy and nice showroom. The only caveat......we were being blasted in our seats by the volume and bass of the speakers nearby. Next time, we will ask for a better seat in the center of the showroom. \nIn spite of sound problems, we will be back. GO SEE THIS KID!"
1,"We ordered the shawarma plate & a sandwich here during lunch hour for around $13. The food was so-so considering there are a lot of middle-eastern options around the city. The lady at the counter was a pusher - quick to tell you what you \""should\"" order. We also found the ambience a bit dingy for our taste."
2,I've never had korean mexican fusion before.  It's an interesting concept.  I had some burritos and nachos.  Food was decent. Service was ok.  Overall a 3.
2,"Came here for lunch today with my coworker. As I perused the menu I didn't see a lot of options and the prices aren't the best I've seen. Service was standard and efficient. I ordered the beef and lamb shawarma and my coworker went with the chicken shawarma. \n\nThey cook everything to order, which makes it take a little longer to prepare than most places, but it's worth the wait for freshness. The food was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but it definitely hit the spot. They serve generous portions and we were both stuffed after our meals."
3,"Hit or miss here, depends on who you \""get.\"" But, there's one stylist there who doers a meticulous, thorough job, so I keep coming back. It's about 5 minutes away from my house as well, so that's a huge bonus. Always a good idea to call ahead... Who likes waiting for a half-hour plus-some for a trim? I don't. Place is clean and pleasant, I usually have a coupon too for the $10.99 hair cut. What a deal."
1,"I was originally put on to going here by a good friend of mine last year and had forgotten about it until just the other day. I decided to take my girlfriend here on our date night and it was easily the worst decision I had ever made.\n\nWhen we first arrived, I could tell there was going to be a problem from the get-go. The \""server\"", if you can call him that, was sitting in the main part of the restaurant, on his phone, and seemingly begrudged that we had stepped in the restaurant. \n\nAfter being unable to give me any direction or recommendations whatsoever, I ordered two BBQ Chicken sandwiches with a potato salad side and a garden salad. \n\nThe food came quickly, but I was quite dissatisfied with it.\n\nTo start, the bun was literally too soggy to pick up. The meat was WAY too watery, which I'm sure was the culprit for the soggy buns. When I say soggy buns, I literally mean that my girlfriend's tiny fingers were able to puncture the bread with extreme ease. The sauce was actually quite tasty, and is the only reason that I decided against giving a 1 star review. It wasn't until after I discarded my meal that I figured out more sauce was available behind the drinking fountains (serviced with probably the poorest selection of soft drinks I have ever witnessed). \n\nNext, my potato salad was literally the most repulsive thing I have ever put in my mouth. I don't know if it was expired or if it was simply the mix you guys use to season it, but you couldn't have paid me to take more than 2 bites out of it.\n\nLastly, there were fly's hovering around my meal the whole time. I understand you are going for the whole \""barbeque theme\"", but when I go to eat at a barbeque restaurant, I'd like to imagine that I am not outdoors in the middle of a night by a buggy swamp. It was literally that bad.\n\nI don't know if this is an isolated incident, or a commonplace thing at Honey Bear's, but I highly doubt I will be back any time soon. I am quite disappointed, because I had always heard such good things about it."
4,Good place! I chose this  place after reading the reviews online. I felt safe taking my suit into this place. Walid was professional and provided good customer service.\n\nI got my suit altered for an interview in just two days (granted I had only couple of minor alternations). But he delivered the suit a day before he promised. \nWhat I liked was I got a text message from these guys as soon as my suit was ready. \nPlace was busy but Walid still catered enough time to each customer.\n\nservices I got done: shortening pants and shortening sleeves (total $40)\n\nI'll definitely choose this place again.
2,"If you need art & and crafts stuff this is a solid bet... Unless you need a lot of arts & crafts stuff. They have a wide variety of things but they don't stock a large quantity of any of them. Need 2 or 3 photo frames on the cheap? You are set. Need 6 boxes of DIY orange floral wedding invitations? You may be SOL, but here's one to get you started. \n\nThe employees are always super friendly, which is a plus but it only mildly takes the edge off the fact that I still have to drive across town to another Michael's."
0,Its always something with this location they have the rudest staff i have ever come across in my life and this review is to cover the six or seven times i have been here over the last two years..........I guess the only reason i went back was too hope they had a staff change but I'm always disappointed their air conditioning is always broken so its usually muggy and sticky  (but don't worry the staff has already aired the owners dirty laundry and said they are too cheap to fix it) So if i don't leave because of that its usually because the servers are sooooo rude i have to leave.  I have called for to go orders several times and they either don't answer the phone or whom ever does makes me feel like the biggest inconvenience i just hang up....i think i have actually only stayed one visit out of six or seven ...i finally reviewed them today because once again i call for to go and i called three times and the first time it rang and rang the other two i got hung up on after a few rings BUT!! The Dennys on Charleston and Torrey pines super awesome every time i will NEVER return to this location
4,"A Charlotte gem. Walking into Paper Skyscraper, you feel like you're in a small town card and gift store, except not. PS is classy. This hot little shop has a complete library of new and classic books, knick knacks, the best card selection you will find in town, and great paper to wrap your gifts (even the ones you buy for yourself because you will find something for yourself here among the toys, jewelry, kitchen items, chocolates, journals, etc...). Plus, there's a naughty little section with wonderful scented massage oils and other \""behind closed door\"" activities. One warning, don't expect to be in and out--I often find hours disappear as I wonder through."
0,Don't waste your time and money like I did. Look up mark fugit orthodics. He custom makes them for your feet at less than 200! I'll never get my money back on a product that helped minimally and made other parts numb.
4,My first time at Film bar and I will definitely be back.  The event was a success and I enjoyed the yelp perks.  Lindsey does a great job greeting everyone as they walk into the door.  The setup was great and the atmosphere was awesome.  \n\nI loved the small trivia questions in the beginning and whoever turned them in first with the right answers won free tickets to Film bar!  A bag of candy to start the movie and I had never seen Raising Arizona.  The event was great and Short Dog Leash provided the dinner.  At $6 a dog you can't beat the great taste and service.\n\nThanks Lindsey!
0,"We have tried to enjoy a meal here on two occasions.  Disappointed is a kind comment.  How can you call yourself an italian restaurant and not be able to make sauce.  Its as if there are no spice in the kitchen at all when they cook.   When we mentioned it to the server, he acted as though the sauce is always bland.  No one cared.  We will not be back."
4,Best. Cheesecake. Ever.
0,"One star is only for the decor of a Chinese noodle restaurant. Don't be fooled by the high ratings of this restaurant like my family did. \n\n** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**\n\nLet me advise you why not to come here:\n- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.\n\n-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.\n\n-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out \""hi, excuse me!\"" while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn't forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. \n\n-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, \""gratuity is included\"". No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.\n\n\n-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they're dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.\n\nThis is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time."
1,"So damn bland. The chips were nothing spectacular although i'll admit to the speed at which they were served. The atmosphere was loud and very fitting for the hard rock hotel but everything left me with buyers remorse. Drinks were $12 and for that price - yes, i expect mediocrity. The margaritas were weak. Weaker than weak. What a bummer - because you need to get a buzz going to at least tolerate the tacos which were too soggy to stomach (if they were able to make it into the mouth before falling apart into a pathetic pile of questionable ingredients). Flavors were unspectacular and as my father said \""like an expensive version of Chilis.\"" Save yourselves the frustration of a costly letdown."
3,"Great food, I had the swordfish (Roy's speciality), perfectly cooked and the sauce was great!! I do not give a fifth star because:  1. They do not have a good beer selection \n2. The ambiance could be better (cheap materials and smells fish all around) \nBut it is a great spot for a nice dinner!"
3,"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side \""Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni\"" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)"
2,"This is strictly for the space, and SLS should stand for small little space, this place is small! Cramped at best. Well done and looks nice but not a lot going on. I just went in there cause I live right across the street and thought I'd do a walk through. It's very well done but SMALL. Ill update my review when I try a few restaurants :) I'm excited to try bazaar and the sushi spot! And to see the foxtail pool!"
1,"I am heartbroken. I've been here on four previous occasions and every time the food has been impeccable and delicious. Had I reviewed The Vig Uptown on one of those prior outings, I would have easily given it four or five stars. The atmosphere is funky but classy and the staff are all nice and welcoming and attentive. This time, sadly, the food did not measure up. I had the carne asada on a potato pancake and while the flavors were spot on, the steak was so overcooked it was like more like jerky than steak. My boyfriend's french fries were both cold and stale. Ick. It may have been an \""off night\"" but unfortunately overcooked meat and cold fries should never have made it out of the kitchen. Someone should have been running quality control. I will come back to The Vig, eventually, but sadly I can no longer rank it among my favorite spots in Phoenix."
0,"This restaurant is fucking stupid. Food is extremely bad and the server's attitude is really bad. We came to eat at 6:30 and our food was coming in 7:00, last time, they charged me 18 more dollars and they do not want to refund it to me . I will not go to that fucking place again. FUCK."
4,"Love this place. Perfectly portioned meals in small, medium and large. Not to mention 21 day challenge is awesome. U only have to pay for the food not the nutritionist advice. They make everything fresh and super easy for u to go in and pick up. Great drinks too. Healthy versions of soda that tastes like soda but without the bad additives and sugar. I will keep coming back!!!!"
2,"If you've never been to Tao, the decor is lovely and the attached nightclub makes people watching an experience,otherwise, give Tao a miss. It's loud, pricey and the food is only so-so. Be especially careful of the trendy dishes like Chilean Sea Bass or Kobe beef, the Tao chefs do not seem to know how to work with quality protiens and we were very disappointed.\n\n*Edit - I received a very nice response from the folks at Tao asking us to return and give them another chance. I am not sure when I will be back in Vegas, but I do have to give them credit for good customer service."
1,"We got the calzones here. The dough was good, but there was waaaayyyy too much Ricotta cheese in them. I'm a huge fan of cheese, so for me to say that is saying a lot. I'm tempted to give this place another chance and try the pizza, but the prices are a little steep....I mean it's pizza, it shouldn't cost 50 buck! I'm glad we had a coupon from restaurant.com We'll probably give it another try for pizza when we get another coupon. From what I've had, I don't think this place is worth the price, I'd rather get a cheap whole costco pizza."
1,"Ate at the Coronado location today.  Had the Vampiro Pastor. The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.  \n\nThe special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor."
1,"Warm welcome.clubby atmosphere suits occasion. Sad salad. Good drinks. Amateurish wine list ,Politely hostile waitress. Assurances of USDA prime = 6/10 Smallish ? 20oz.? Porterhouse. Pathetic dull pink rewarmed Prime rib.\nDessert very good.No relish tray.Try ClubA in NYC or BobR's backyard for charcoal grilles organic free range grass fed corn finished bone in\nHeaven . Avoid this place."
3,This place has the best wings and on Thursday for football special they have a prime rib dinner that is incredible . The service and general manager chris are all very friendly and professional.
2,"So after being here for almost a year, I am pulling her out. The staff is cool but I think it's a little pricey. I wish that they would work on lowering the tuition but they wouldn't. So if you plan on coming here expect to burn holes through your pocket. \n\n\nMy daughter has been coming here for 2 weeks. I know it's a little early for a review, but I'll make sure to update this review in a month. So far I love that they actually do things with the toddlers. This place reminds of Bright Horizon. I think this place is a little cheaper. I love that there is a curriculum. They have circle time and when I picked her up today, the teacher was blowing bubbles and the toddlers loved it. The other day i picked her up one of the teachers was playing blocks with the kids. For now, I am very satisfied. I'll check back in and let you all know how much she has learned. Which is one if the main reasons I moved her here. STAY TUNED! :)"
1,"Great food and atmosphere but two rounds of shots for 5,  a plate of fries and 2 games of bowling came out to 360.00!!!!  I would NEVER go back here. .. way over priced. .."
3,"We've been here twice since we moved to the Burgh. It's convenient, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is pretty good.\n\nThe veggie burger was too soft and salty, so on our second trip here I got the king salmon burger and it was muchhh better. I wish the buns were not so soft, maybe they could grill them, since the veggie/fish burgers are not very firm. \n\nWhat makes this place for me is the sides! I love the fried pickles, they have the perfect crunchy shell and the pickles themselves are tasty! Onion rings were good but not amazing, I really enjoy the dips you can select for the fries. \n\nI got a beertail last time I was here and it was pretty good, not too sweet so it goes well with the food!\n\nNot the best burger I have ever had but it's good and we've never had a problem getting a table."
0,I'm sure the food and desserts are great...but I just needed some water. I was totally dehydrated. I think it's a bit much to charge $5.41 for water.
3,"What a quaint little bistro this is! \n\nWe made reservations to dine with some friends for dinner.  There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy.\n\nWe started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake.  They were good!  Not over the top but still good.   This was served with mixed greens,  At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table.  It was just ok.  It was kind of mushed and dry.  For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about.   I  can see why...  Delicious and tasty!  The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish.  The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok.  I wish there was more of a pesto flavor.  \n\nThe service here is impeccable.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating.   \n\nOur entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out! Thanks Bernards!"
2,I love the products they sell.  I am consistently less impressed with the staff.  There is usually only one person per section who has a clue.  I try to find that person when I have questions.
4,"Great, authentic Northeastern Thai Food! Careful on the spiciness! Yes, they do have a great Khao Soi!"
3,"We dined at Nine on Nine on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. We appreciated that the hostess was accomodating- our table was originally near the door and when we requested to be moved it was no problem.\n\nOur waitress, while overall pretty good, was very slow in coming to the table to greet us and take drink orders. I ordered a cosmo and it was made Perfectly- I only wish the glass had been filled instead of the short pour I got.  \n\nThe food is very good. I had the special lamb chops and, while a little more fatty than I prefer, were tasty and cooked to my specifications."
2,Stay outside not inside!\n\nI came here and was highly impressed with the outside lounge/dance area. There was a glass area where you could see all the way down below you. The view from the outside is tremendous!\n\nThe place is dark and the bar is also rather small too. The interior nothing special to write about because there really is no dance floor.\n\nThis place is really a lounge/bar than a club. Good place to start but not to end.
2,"Stable crew, good food with good value, great neighborhood casino.\n\nHere's what you get at this Montana Meat Co.: Steak & Eggs , burgers, salads, and appetizers and even a surf and turf special menu all moderately priced. Quality is really good. Bloody Mary menu is pretty strong though that's where the profit margin is ($8 each). The people that work here are stable and have been here for quite some time. It's nice to see the same group of people working here.\n\nThe atmosphere is hipster/modern with exposed eye-beams and subdued colors in the dining area. Good selection of tuneage. While this is probably the closest neighborhood casino and 24-hour place that serves breakfast closest to Rhodes Ranch and Mountain's Edge, it attracts large groups of families with small children with the chaos and distractions that follow.\n\nAll in all, this Montana Meat Co. deserves a good review for good value and selection of food and a stable group of staff that try hard and care.\n\nHere's what you don't get: if you think this place is the Bellagio, Wynn, or Caesars Palace... you've come to far off The Strip. If you are pressed for time, McDonalds is right down Blue Diamond. If you think you are the only person in the world and deserve the very best in attention and pampering, Beverly Hills awaits you and baybee this ain't Beverly Hills. If you want an $80 meal with a Groupon 2-for-1 and tip on the discounted total, you might be happier going somewhere else.\n\nAs for the rest of us that appreciate this place for what it is and is not, we'll enjoy the Devo and Donna Summer and Steak & Eggs and neighborhood gambling."
1,"Blech! Eek! Yuck! Went here last Saturday with my compadres, Myles M, Kristin S and a few others. We had been day drinking substantially and still thought the food was barely edible. Having grown up in California, I am completely aware of the variety of \""Mexican food\"" that exists. I've had true authentic food with cactus, Americanized Tex Mex like they serve at places like Chevy's and drive-through places like Filiberto's, and I'm ok with eating at the less authentic end of the spectrum. That being said, I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients, to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money. And the food at Macayo's is none of those. \n\nThe special shrimp burrito we got had a decently spicy sauce, but the tortilla was soggy and greasy. The Spanish rice was the worst I've ever had. My friend's \""grilled veggie\"" fajitas were overcooked, mushy, STEAMED veggies like carrots and broccoli. What a curse to be a vegetarian in this joint! The house salsa was OK but I've had better from a jar. \n\nThe only saving grace of this place was that it was crowded and lively on a Saturday night (always something I miss dining in Central Phoenix). The pitcher of margaritas we got was also decent and not too sweet. \n\nSorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review. Macayo's sucks and I'm not afraid to say it."
3,Another romantic spot.  I haven't been in a while... but I have always enjoyed my meals in the past.  Southwestern influenced cuisine.  Beautiful patio.  Great service.
3,Good traditional Mexican food.  Quick too.\n\nExcellent shredded chicken!
1,I expected more from this place. Not worth the trip if you're on the strip.
4,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
4,"Honestly, I walked out of the show... and was at a complete loss of what to say. This guy was simply amazing. He is a comedian, singer, impersonator, ventriloquist, puppeteer and manages to combine all of them into one very entertaining and greatest hits-type of show.\n\nIt blew my mind that he was able to sing a duet of \""Unforgettable\"" with himself while impersonating Nat King Cole's voice, while also maneuvering a puppet interacting with him and the crowd and simultaneously impersonate Natalie Cole's voice for the puppet's portions of the duet AND inserting smart aleck comments between himself and the puppet during the breaks in the song (Do you understand that? Does that description make sense? That's the level of talent integration I am talking about!!!). He does this with multiple puppets... each with their own history and personality. Again... amazing.\n\nHis ability to impersonate voices is incredible. I have heard that he has many songs that he is able to perform on alternate shows, but a few of the highlights on the night I went were:\n   - Adam Levine from Maroon 5 (Really Makes Me Wonder)\n   - Cee-Lo from Gnarles Barkley/GooDie MoB (Crazy)\n   - Marvin Gaye (Let's Get it On)\n   - Etta James (At Last)\n\nHe even performed a nice little Michael Jackson tribute in which he sang \""Billie Jean\"" and, incredibly, \""Ben.\""  I point these out because all of the aforementioned have particularly unique voices that can be identified and recognized... but he nailed them all.\n\nHe also seems to be a very down to earth kind of guy. He doesn't emit that \""superstar\"" vibe and seems to be very humble. There were a few times during the show when there was so much going on between him and the puppet characters he was playing that he would mess up a little. It was funny because he would have his puppets make fun of him or have the puppet say something funny like, \""It's weird but I just cannot seem to talk whenever you start laughing.\"" It could be due to the fact that he is still new to all this, however, during his show he mentioned the fact that he has been doing this type of routine on his own and way before \""America's Got Talent\"" for at least 15-20 years. So, maybe a \""regular guy\"" finally made it.\n\nThey say timing is everything and, with the passing of Danny Gans, Terry Fator happened to get his timing right. But timing can only get you there, talent has to really kick in and maintain you. Terry Fator definitely has the talent to back up the fact he has not only replaced Danny Gans, but the \""Danny Gans Theatre\"" has been renamed the \""Terry Fator Theatre\"" as a tribute as well.\n\nHands down... he is a must see."
3,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Been here about 5 times, tried a few different things  ok here goes the shrimp tacos and brisket tacos - deelish! The hushpuppies - best I've ever had. The burgers - omg the burgers! So juicy and tender. The onion rings - amazing and perfectly seasoned! The brisket would be my favorite, but also can be hit or miss. The ribs are great and the pulled pork - best thing on the menu and that's saying A LOT! They also have great drinks specials each night!"
0,"I will never be back. I was rushed to order when at about 12:30 only three people were at the restaurant. Then when I ordered the lunch special they forgot to bring my soup. Whoever said the hot and sour soup was terrible was dead on. The meat doesn't even taste good in it. \n\nThe orange chicken tasted like ketchup or vinegar. The fried rice was not good. \n\nThe service was rushed and unfriendly. I can go to a place and eat even if the service isn't good.\n\nThe food was terrible. The only decent thing I ate was the egg roll and wonton. Not sure if it was just the cook, but even the staff seemed as though they were arguing. \n\nAnd to top it off my fortune cookie had no fortune when opened. It seemed as bough it was the icing on the cake. When all and all I am mostly disappointed in my lunch choice."
4,"Consistently the best \""purist\"" BBQ in CLT. Meat is cooked over **real** wood in a pit I would be proud to have in my home (yes, I am a BBQ freak). Wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake.\n\nMost/all the BBQ posers these days cook with gas or electricity. It ain't the same folks. Before you go into a BBQ restaurant, drive around back. Woodpile? If not, keep driving. Is the wood neatly stacked? If so, be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at 4AM isn't typically neat with his pile. Does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours? We've got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically, but has a smoke-emitting stack- kinda like a smoke-sign. I refuse to set foot in the place on principal.\n\nHickory House does pork, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken may be good (can't say), but this **is** North Carolina, folks. The only BBQ worth having in NC is pork. Never order french onion soup at a chinese place, I say. Go to Texas if you want beef.\n\nAs others have said, this place is a nondescript, brick, rectangle in an area of North Tryon which has seen better days. Ever heard of the Hidden Valley Kings? Lock your car and hide your valuables. Speaking from personal experience, here.\n\nThis is one of those buildings I wish could talk. The restaurant obviously started out as a road-house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in \""the woods\"". I bet it has a ghost or two roaming around. Looks like the kind of place your parents' doctor/lawyer/accountant met his receptionist for \""overtime\"" work back in the 60's.\n\nPersonally, I am partial to their chopped BBQ sammich, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. \n\nIf you're lucky/blessed/living right, your sammich will have some crunchy \""outside\"" in it. You can get the sammich with or without slaw- your choice. I alternate.\n\nBrunswick stew is worth driving across town for (I do).\n\nThe hushpuppies are not health food, but they are addictive. We start out with an order as an appetizer. Don't know where they come from, but they will contribute to my early demise, I'm sure.\n\nIf you're like me and despise MBA-driven, vinyl restaurants, Hickory House ought to be on your short list. This is the place I hold up as the finest example in CLT of the way BBQ is supposed to be done. Even if the food wasn't 5-star, it is worth a trip just so you can tell your kids about it someday. There are fewer and fewer of these places left every day and we'll all be poorer when they're gone."
0,"Horrible business, went to location on Rancho to get a oil change. Notice upon check out they did not use the correct Manufactor Recommendation 5w30. I asked the guy at the desk to correct the problem. He got the manager, manager said, \""I will have to charge you for another oil change if that is what you want\"" my comment back was, \""you need to follow the directions they place on the chaises of the vehicle, and not just use any old oil you have laying around your shop.\"" At this point the manager was yelling at me in front of his customers and I was yelling back because the manager Jesse is not a real manager. I was told to contact the Pecos location by the front desk guy and I did, the manager at this location was just as bad as the location I went to-yelling over the phone at me. Needless to say if you are looking for a quality mechanic, try another mechanic and skip Royalty because if they could read they would be using the right parts for the right job."
3,"I've been here twice for lunch, and it's very good! I love authentic Mexican food and this definitely hits the spot. The price is good, too. I hope La Palapa sticks around because Southside was in need of a good, authentic Mexican restaurant. It finally has one!"
4,"If you want to go to a dive in downtown Madison, then you definitely should check out Paradise.  There's 2 reasons why Paradise gets a 5 in my book:\n\n1)  They have cheap beer.  Speciifically, the $5.50 PBR/Leinenkugel pitchers are a steal.\n2)  The \""ambience\"" is top notch.  It attracts a great and varied crowd, with people of all ages and income.  Also, they play metal music really loudly all of the time.  So, if 80's thrash is your thing, then you'll feel welcome at Paradise.\n\nThese 2 points alone very easily help me ignore all of the shortcomings of paradise:  The lack of decor, the food not being very good, the sort of weird layout, etc. etc.  But they don't matter to me, because that isn't what I come to Paradise for.  I go to Paradise to get away from the fancy drinks and yuppies that inhabit most other bars in the area, and to welcome the simple pleasure of drinking domestics to hard rock music."
2,"First thing I have to say, is believe all the other reviews when they talk about the amount of food you will get here!  The second thing I have to say is that everything is average.  Crazy Otto's excels with service, as it is extremely quick, attentive, and efficient.  We were able to have breakfast in under 30 minutes.  That's a good thing for me.  The food however is just average at above average prices.  I got bacon, eggs, toast, and hashbrowns for my meal.  I was served a massive platter of food that I knew I wouldn't finish.  The bacon was okay, but unfortunately some parts of it were burnt.  The eggs (scrambled) were actually really good!  They were light and fluffy and very tasty.  The hashbrowns were no good.  I never get good hashbrowns unless I am at Matt's.  I was pleasantly surprised that nothing felt very greasy.  I probably won't go back because there about a million other places just like it and I would rather go somewhere new."
4,"Yelpers, \n\nIt's taken me a year to find this place. Back then, I (wrongly) thought that every haircut was the same, so why not go for the best price?? Trust me when I say that didn't turn out well. Seriously, I've been to just about every haircut place you can imagine in Scottsdale and this one is by far the best. Nodari is hair cutting prodigy. Come here if you're looking for skilled, professional barbers. Thanks again!"
2,Very good choices and portions from the lunch menu. Would return for a quick lunch if I'm in the mood for Thai close by. I would search elsewhere for a favorite Thai place though.
3,"Wow Paint Monkey is a such a great time.  What a ball, what a blast.  My sister who is very artistic and who loves to paint accompanied me to the Paint an Easter Bunny class.  I found the experience to be really nice and Joe is so charming. This was a children's class and everyone's paintings turned out amazingly nice. I think I over heard a guest say that she had been back three times.\n\nNext time I am going back for BYOB!"
4,"Wow... a decent priced meal in Vegas...and it was GOOD!  This is a great sandwich shop!  I love hot sandwiches, and this has to be one of ...if not the best I have had.  it is in a great location, just between the Miracle Mile shops and the Casino in Planet Hollywood.  I suggest making this a must stop for a bite! YUM!"
0,Do not rent from this people!!!  I had a car booked through expedia and went to pick it up.  I was told that in economy they only had these tiny deathtrap cars left so Sergio suggested that I upgrade to something bigger.  When I went to pick up the car I saw that it wasn't true... they did have something other than these tiny cars in economy.    He had lied.  After I had driven off... I looked at the ticket and realized that they had charged me $220 more to upgrade... I'm ending up paying  around $450 for a two day rental.  Unbelievable!
0,Do not go to Red Rock...staff there gave my room away and refused to get me another room when I arrived late after telling them I would arrive late.  I paid for two nights and they took my $ (with Groupon getaway).  Then they would not give my money back or give me a room for the 2nd night after I arrived and told them I was arriving on 2nd night.  Red Rock and Groupon are unethical businesses.  Go to another hotel and Do Not use Groupon Getaway deals...buyer beware....jack in San Diego.  E
0,"They gave me the worst service I have ever gotten. I call up and ask for a pick up. I give the cross streets and that I'm going to an apartment. The guy asks me where to multiple times in an annoyed tone. So I say why do you need to know more? He responds for the cab drivers safety like I'm going to kill him or something. I then say a scottsdale apartment and he says that's all your going to tell me? I say do you need me to be more specific?  He says well we can't help you for a scottsdale apartment and refuses to send a cab, but I notice that this for scottsdale can company  so the reason isn't that I am too far away.  Wow what an asshole. This how you get people to pay you. I heard that they pay for excellent reviews which makes sense since they have 4.5/5 stars on Google yet they have no customer service"

My bros and husband have been here before, but we're too drunk to remember if it was good :/\n\nThere were a few people waiting, but we were quickly taken in. The place is buzzing with people and waitresses taking order and passing out food. \n\nWe ordered their ICHIZA Ramen DX (miso soup based ramen), chicken skewers, fried mozzarella cheese (wrapped in egg roll wrapper), pork 'n nappa (stir fried pork with shiitake mushrooms), and chicken bowl with egg. I enjoyed everything minus the chicken bowl. The chicken tasted like it was just microwaved and then they dumped scrambled egg on top. There's nothing to rave about. It's just OK.\n\nWe came here after a looooooooong drive from LA.

2,"Out of the many Chinese restaurants in Waterloo, Jia Jia Lok  (JJL) is one of the few that does not specialize in Northern or Szechuan Chinese cuisine. \n\nBeing a regular there for my four years in Waterloo, you do not go to JJL for the ambience or the service. You go here to get a good, simple and hearty meal at an affordable student friendly price. An added bonus for those of you who understand Cantonese is listening to the banter between the husband and wife duo of the establishment. \n\nThe food is exactly what you would find at the Hong Kong equivalent of a greasy spoon: Baked Pork Chop with Tomato Sauce on Rice, Satay Beef on Rice, Spicy Eggplant and Minced Pork on Rice & Fried Chicken Noodle soup. Portions are pretty good for it size and is pretty filling. Lunch specials are offered Monday to Friday with set dishes and comes with a soup\n\nNote: Cash Only (BMO, RBC, Scotiabank ATM are at King and University). Closed Saturdays."
3,"Gas is decently priced but if you are a smoker, one of the best priced around."
0,The owner is incredibly rude and not a nice personality. My server was good and food was greqt..in spite of its location next to work I do jot want to return for how the owner treated me. And I witnessed him prohibiting an easy substitution requested by anothwr customer. ..who she and another guest walked out following this. Menu even suggests willingness to provide menu requests and substitution.  It is too bad the owner has such a foul personality and doesnt respect his customers.
4,My go to for Pho and Goi Cuon!  Been coming here for YEARS before they got packed for winning best of on New Times!  Legit place.  Come for Authentic Vietnamese food. Prices are ridiculous in an affordable way and veggies are freah.
3,"This is a nice little resto / Bistro that is also a bring your own wine.  The menu was between fine dining wanna be and a comfort food diner, but still good.  The crowd was a mix of young trendy to older locals.  \nWith reasonable prices, good location and a friendly staff I'm sure I'll be making another visit in the near future.  check this place out if your in the neighborhood."
2,"Ok, so Cricket Pavilion, is what it is.  I've been there a few times through out it's time and have seen some great concerts there, but man, does this place need a make over.   Let's start with the outside, I felt like I was pulling in to an abandoned Drive In Theatre about to make out with my girlfriend in the back seat.  The walk to the gate was full of 3 feet weeds and there was zero landscaping. A small group was, \""tailgating\"" on a mound full of weeds and rocks, I thought, wow, they are desperate.  The concession stands haven't changed in about 10 years and the pre-concert activity was non existent.  The concert was still great and I still had a blast so I can't say it was all bad, it's just time to make it a little bit nicer."
2,Worth a look if you are in the area. It is weird to think that all this lies below the huge solid buildings that are at street level. \nThe guide did his job well and was very entertaining. Didn't see anything of the paranormal variety but perhaps the ghosts feel the same way I do about American tourists.
4,I have been getting my lashes done here for a year now and I love it! I get so many compliments on my lashes. The service is great and the atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. I've had just a couple scheduling issues but everyone worked really hard to accommodate me. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
3,"Great place for salads...BUT falls short of its parent company Panera. Unlike Panera, Paradise does not offer, nor do they have bread selections with their salads, with the price about the same. Additionally, unlike their parent company Paradise does not offer a pastry at a reduced price (99-cents) when you purchase a salad and drink. Good place to eat, but disappointed if you are thinking about Panera."
1,"I had high hopes, but alas, they were dashed.  Although the flavor was good, they skimped on the ingredients.  Plenty of bread, of course, but unfortunately, like all chain sandwich joints, there was only a tiny bit of meat and cheese.  In fact, when I opened the wrapper there was no filler visible at all - my sandwich simply looked like a loaf of bread.  Only by peering at the cut end could I discern the miniscule serving of beef.  Even Subway (which does not taste as good) does better when it comes to quantity of filling.\n\nAnd of course it goes without saying that the sandwich looked nothing at all like the photos on the menu, with their hearty portions.\n\nNot recommended unless you fancy paying $8 for a small loaf of bread.\n\nOtherwise, the service was good and the restaurant was clean."
2,"Please god, show up at least semi buzzed so you are distracted by the filth that is the Essen Haus.  Then order up a boot of beer for you and your friends.  Skip the food in general, but the soft pretzels will do in a pinch if the copious amounts of beer have endangered your stomach.\n\nthe good:  their excellent selection of German beer, boots of beer and kitschy polka bands\nthe bad: everything else, including the kitschy polka bands"
4,"Danny's always does a great job. Their staff is friendly and accommodating. Their lobby is so fun..some much stuff to look at and enjoy. My kids love the toys. My car every time looks great. Once you go there I promise you wont go anywhere else...cobblestone, weiss guys...don't waste your time."
3,"My only complaints are that I wish they had longer hours and that the parking signage situation was worked out. \n\nI know when I'm working later into the evening I don't want to have to drive out of Garfield all the way down to C.M. in Bloomfield and deal with the clouds of cigarette-smoking hipsters and the other choice (not really a choice) is Starbuckos near Whole Foods - forget that! \n\nThe coffee is awesome, the people are awesome, and they have a great place there - open, inviting, free of clutter but not sterile-looking - inviting I guess it the right word for it. I can't say enough about the coffee too - it's so good! I've taken several friends that are big-time coffee aficionados there and they love it too! \n\nThey also have some food which I've had limited experience with but they source it all locally which is great!"
0,sisig is good but the service sucks and they have NO refills...i know it's a Filipino bar but seriously this is NOT the fckn Philippines! quit being CHEAP!
3,"I hear the commercials on Barry Young in the morning all the time and decided to make the drive out today to give the place a try.  I had expected it to on the upscale side because of the advertising that they do, but the place has a bright but divey feel to it,  That is fine with me.  The place was clean and I wouldn't hesitate to bring my family.\n\nMy friend and had the 2&2 with iced tea.  They have fresh brewed sweetened and not sweetened.  The tea is good but not fantastic.  The burger was nice, the patties are a little thin but not ridiculously so like Freddy's.  \n\nThe fries are a thicker cut natural and fresh fry.  They are light on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside.  Above average for fresh fries in the area but similar to Five Guys (but not with the ridiculous amount you get at 5 Guys).  \n\nThe food was cheap at under $14 for both orders.  There is beer, they have cans of San Tan beers, some of the macro brews in bottles and Bud and Bud Lite on tap.\n\nThe owner was working the counter and seems like a nice guy that is putting out good product."
0,Ehhhh. Couldn't get a med rare cut of prime rib to save my ass. It was all med-well to well. Gross!
0,"Although the food was very good at this restaurant, it is likely that I will never return. Upon my visit, I mentioned the broken chairs to the manager. (I recently lost the end of a finger in a broken chair at a restaurant.) His reply to my concern was that he would put it into the \""whatever it's worth column.\"" I cannot support a restaurant that is not concerned for the welfare of its patrons! Good luck if you go!"
1,"I stayed at the encore from 07/4/2013-07/8/2013 this is hotel is gorgeous in and out I I'll definitely not say anything negative about that... My few complaints are the way I was treated when I went to a craps table here. I was sitting at a slot machine enjoying a beer when I heard a lot of cheering going on at a craps table so I decided to go check it out and maybe jump in the game.. When I go over there and start watching the pit boss asked this \""high roller\"" I guess if he was going to Make a bet and the exact words that came from this guys mouth was \""yeah I will make my bet when you get this as*hole outta here\"" (he was talking to me but I didn't even know at first) then the pit boss asks me to leave and says its a \""private\"" game... \n\n1. There were no stantions blocking it off\n2.No one said anything besides this douche who was dressed like a slob\n3. All because you have money doesn't mean you talk to people like that especially a paying guest\n\nThe pit boss then Denies he called me a \""as*hole when everyone clearly heard him!\n\nI'm basically told the guy (the shaggy dude) if he wanted to find out who a real ahole was we can go outside and he just stood there ...\n\nThat's my MAIN complaint.. They did nothing to fix the situation you don't let people be treated that way who are paying over 1000 dollars to stay there...\n\n\nOverall the hotel charges WAY too much for EVERYTHING like come on 19.65 for two coronas at the bar? What are they smoking ... I refused to pay that..\n\nThe room itself was really nice .. 21st floor strip view.. Can't complain..\n\nOverall my opinion save your money and go somewhere with LESS RESORT FEES... These hotels are getting insane.."
3,Great food and awesome service.  I ordered the appetizer sliders (wasn't too hungry) and got a huge portion - 4 sliders (cheeseburgers) with fries.  My associate ordered the appetizer size mussels and commented they were the best he's ever had (and he's had them all over the world).  Inside was a little noisy.  Generous outside patio space was quieter.
4,This location is right near my house and I had broken my phone the night before so I was dreading coming in here worrying about how much I'd have to pay before walking out the door with my iPhone.  David helped me when I came in this morning and he did an excellent job.  He helped me be creative with the upgrade and provided fantastic customer service.  Informed me on different options they offer and told me about their new alarm system packages they have.  I've been an AT&T customer for over 12 years and I'll continue to stay with AT&T.
3,"Really enjoyed seeing the Cubs play here, great park with really friendly fans.  If I can't see my favorite team at Wrigley, this is one of my two number two choices.\n\nClean, decent food and great sight lines.  Like the location right next to the river and we hit fireworks night which sold the place out.  The neighborhood around it is a bit sterile, no real feel to it but it's young.  \n\nHad a great visit here on our ongoing tour of MLB parks.  This one merits a return visit."
3,"We visited this restaurant a while ago. I found the setting to be really comfy and fun. I shared a few dishes with my partner. We ordered a few noodle dishes, which were delicious, but not something I can remember a few months later. The pork belly buns were a little different than others I had tried. Overall, it was a really nice environment in a trendy area."
3,"Ive been here numerous times. A good place for consistent food and drinks when shopping or errands on that side of town.\nThis review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us.\nWe were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready. \nThey handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?"
4,"We looked out our hotel room window to see this pizza shop staring at us. We called down and found out they will delivery directly to our room, bonus!!!!!  We ordered a medium ultimate meat pizza and it was huge and yummy. We also got the garlic knots, OMG!!!!  They were so good we had to order them a second and third night."
1,"Both bars served terrible drinks. One didn't wash the cleaner out of the glass enough, the other didn't seem to notice the mixer was flat. If you want to tolerate awful remixes and bad drinks this may be an option. If you want a decent drink in a good (not desperate) atmosphere, stay away! Never going back again."
2,I stopped by this Goodwill located on Southern Ave and Stewart on 9/23/2011 to donate some items and discovered that it was closed. They moved to 1046 S Country Club Dr. (480-844-0906). The new location is next to Bookman's on the NW corner of Southern Ave and Country Club Dr.
1,Not impressed with the food. The food really lacked seasoning and taste.
2,"Being a beer lover, I had to try this place on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is German themed, with a large beer garden where you eat at communal picnic tables. There is also an indoor area that is much less charming.  If you are reserving a table, be sure to specify if you want the beer garden.\n\nOn the night of our visit there was a German accordion band playing, which provided a lot of (kind of corny) entertainment though it was a bit loud. The band obviously has a few fans who come regularly wearing their t shirts and at times get up to dance to the music.\n\nThe beer was good, I especially liked the Penn Weizen.  We tried a few others that were ok but not memorable.  As to the food, the fresh pretzel with beer cheese was a good starter. For the entrees I would recommend the Polish Hill Plate, which came with kielbasa, perogies and sauerkraut. This item was  far better than the breaded pork schnitzel which I found to be greasy and too large a portion of meat. The sides of applesauce and red cabbage were only so so.\n\nOverall, a fun evening, I think that one visit will be enough, but we enjoyed it for what it was."
3,This place has a nice balcony. It's by no means the classiest of clubs but not the sleeziest of clubs either. I'd go back. The heat lamps are great and it has a nice view of the strip. They could use some more seating and parts area little over crowded.  It's a fun place to go dancing with the girls.
1,The food is so-so to average ....... and then it falls off the cliff .......\n                             The prices are OVER-THE-TOP !!!!\n       *This is an EGO DRIVEN Restaurant\n       *Signs all over the place ....... about The Food Network\n       \nIf you have an yen for an OVER-RATED experience ....GO\n                    You won't be disappointed
3,Easy in and out. has Diesel. Truck stop in the back if you need to park for a while (or fix your freakin truck in my case). Great little typical truck stop store. Some slot machines (right outside of the restrooms...who thought of that? My kids didn't want to leave them alone) But the real cous de gras? This location has a DUNKIN DONUTS inside. READ: Dunkaccino! For the win!
3,Love this place. alough they need to stay open later and stock beer from the rear of cooler so you alwasy get cold beer.
3,Decent quality food and plenty of variety
2,"Its huge yes lots of music and food, however I found that merchandise just kept repeating for the most part. Yes the old days it was a lot of blankets on the ground. Yes it had some junk, however there were treasures to be had. Comics, sports cards collectibles. All kinds of fun stuff you didn't expect. Not so much now!!"
3,"I love Mimis Cafe! Even though the menu has changed they still have great recipes and salads I can't avoid. My husband personally isn't a fan, but I've become very good at talking him into coming to Mimis at least once a month ;-) Funny enough, he always loves the food and it is usually pretty quiet. It's nice too, to see the same faces working there over the years. I've been coming to this location since it opened :)"
1,I can't explain what draws me to Amir. I have tried several locations and I leave disappointed every time.\n\nI ordered the falafel plate and the falafel are cold. The accompanying salad is nothing special. Just some iceberg lettuce and a few tomato slices. The hummus is pretty good but the garlic sauce is nothing like traditional middle eastern garlic sauce but more like a garlic infused mayo. \n\nI've decided to stop torturing myself with my bad choice so I'm going to toss it and find another place to have lunch.
4,"Great food, espcially the crab legs and stone crab bisque. Service was excellent across the board."
0,Don't go! The service is awful and the price is pretty high. Please be careful the amount on the bill before you sign it. They will automatically charge you 18% gratuity without your permission; even you only have three people dining. They should be shame of their service and very high gratuity.
1,"The steaks were excellent, but the sides were terrible.  Small and too salty, the potatoes tasted like instant.  The Caesar salad was extremely lemony. The service was so so.  We asked for more bread, it never came.  We felt rushed even though the restaurant wasn't even half full."
0,"If you are a hunter, get your hunting gear ready because this is the place for you! Devil's Martini North is an excellent Puma and Cougar hunting ground. This desert watering hole attracts these two populations in full force. Watching them interact in their natural habitat can be highly interesting, to say the least.\n\nOh, and although they are in their natural habitat, these species are far from \""natural\"" themselves. It seems as though many of them have had mutations and augmentations due to a disease called \""lack of self-confidence\"". This disease has spread rampantly throughout this 40+ female population, and male hunters of all kinds come to watch.\n\nGet my point? Devil's North is worthless. It's located in a North Scottsdale strip mall (near a Safeway nonetheless), sometimes they have a cover (they should pay you to come here) and what really cracks me up is that they have valet parking... yet there is an overabundance of spots since it's in a strip mall!\n\nThe patrons here are laughable. You know those guys that wear men's shoes with a heel? They come here. And you know those 50+ women who think that they are a \""sexier\"" version of Samantha from Sex and The City? They come here too.\n\nThere are two visually disgusting occurrences that I unfortunately witnessed here - both perfectly describe the atmosphere. The first was a group of 30+ women, dressed like sleaze balls with obvious plastic surgery enhancements on display, trying to act like strippers on the dancing platform, while their 50+ husbands with orange fake tans sat on the couches nearby watching them. PUKE. The second time, it was about 8pm and the music inside was bumping. No one was on the dance floor. Well, except for two highly intoxicated 20 something girls bumping and grinding on each other while making eyes at the male hunters watching them. DOUBLE PUKE. Some patrons here are so sad that that the people watching isn't even amusing. \n\nIt's great that they have 2-4-1 drink specials but the drinks aren't anything special. I am embarrassed to admit this, but I have also eaten here as well. Don't do it. The service is average, nothing to write home about. I've waited ages for drinks/food when it's not even that packed.\n\nOh, and this place is so \""classy\"" that you are not allowed to wear a baseball hat inside. Riiiiiight. Yet cougars dressed as whores are allowed to run rampant through this place? Methinks not. Pass on Devil's Martini North. Save yourself from visual torture (unless you are a hunter)."
0,"I was excited to find a place close to home that was casual and decently priced. I ordered the Chicken Greek Pita, which tasted nothing like a Greek Pita. It was pretty much, chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce with some sort of a mayo sauce. I didn't even finish it and I was starving. My friend ordered a GRILLED Chicken Salad and the chicken wasn't even grilled. The bowl was so small, all of the salad kept falling out onto the bar-top. He also didn't finish his meal. It's also a pet peeve when restaurants make you pay for your sides. \n\nAll in all, I will not go here again."
4,"I go here frequently. There are few restaurants who I feel make food better than I can, but this is one of them. My favorite are the Kijafa Cherry crepes, the apple pancake, and the Swedish pancakes. But honestly, every item I've had here is top quality. \nI just wish they were open later so I could get this stuff for dinner as well."
0,"I read about the high scoring reviews on Yelp and decided to try it but was sorely disappointed. The food is relatively authentic, but much more of a \""home-style\"" than restaurant style. My biggest gripe is the food/price value of Miu's which is exceptionally abysmal. A 2 person meal ended up almost $50 for some appetizers, main course and some soup.\n\nPlease note, as I ordered in Chinese, I don't exactly know the English names used in the menu and even the Chinese names listed may not be exactly the same as the menu, but should be quite close to their dish name.\n\nCong You Bing (Scallion Pancake) - Extremely oily, no crispiness whatsoever and quite small. Almost certainly from a frozen package at about $4. Head to the frozen section in Lee Lee's or Mekong Plaza supermarket if you want a superior version (seriously).\n\nDan Dan Mian (Dan Dan Noodles) - Some cooked noodles resting above a spicy sauce (about a couple tablespoons worth) and you mix it up yourself. There's literally nothing else, no meat or soup just some green onion. Tastes okay, but not okay enough for another $4. This dish takes me back to my college years, eating cooked Top Ramen with mixed in Sriracha or something. Cost me about 20 cents.\n\nGuo Pa Soup (Sizzling Rice Soup) - Served as a relatively small bowl of soup and a plate of loose scorched rice. Imagine a clear broth with 2-3 shrimp pieces and 3-4 pork pieces with some mushrooms and veggies, with a side plate of baked loose rice krispies that somehow lost his marshmallow friend and couldn't combine into a block. Now maybe that sounds kind of appetizing, but in a decent restaurant this is normally served as a large block of scorched rice, resembling that of a Rice Krispie treat. You then are supposed to pour the soup on top of said rice block and it's supposed to snap crackle and pop as a savory soup/krispie combination with lots of meat and veggies. Instead, at Miu's you sprinkle this rice dandruff on your soup like some sort of liquid breakfast from another dimension. The meager amount of meat in this dish is mildly amusing until you remember you're out $8 for the privilege.\n\nMa Po Doufu (Ma Po Spicy Tofu) - Not bad tofu, spicy as expected. This was the dish I had least problems with during my experience, but it's pretty hard to screw up tofu mixed in with some spicy sauce. This is almost breakfast cereal levels in terms of  difficulty of \""construction\"" so I'm not sure if I should be thankful I got an okay dish or sorry that I had to pay $8 for it.\n\nXuan Rong Bai Ji (Garlic White Chicken) - We ordered half a chicken which would seem like a lot of food, which came cold-cut with some garlic sprinkled on top. The garlic mixture on the chicken tastes very similar to Chino Bandido's Emerald Chicken (if you're familiar with that). Usually in Asia when you order this you get very few bones and big chunks of all white meat. This was not the case and a majority of pieces could be described as some bones trying not to look naked by covering up with cartilage and some meat. This was the final nail in the coffin as this was certainly less than half a pound and costs a HILARIOUS $15 dollars. By far and away the biggest rip off from a restaurant in recent memory and the fact that this dish alone costs the same amount as eating at Pacific Seafood buffet is quite the accomplishment in an exercise of separation from reality.\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed in the meal I got for about $43 after tax, then after tipping, it's basically $50 for 2 people. The portions were small, the food was mediocre, prices were extreme and the service was nothing to write home about. Atmosphere? Pretend you're eating in a white walled living room with some Chinese lanterns/fans hung about with 80s-90s chinese music in the background. Makes me feel like I'm eating at a Grandma's or something.\n\nThe kicker is the fact that each dish was so small for the price you paid, which makes you feel like a huge sucker. I at least expected the dishes to be big for the price, as in superior places like China King. Speaking of comparisons, I could've gorged myself at Pacific Seafood buffet for $15-16 per person and I would've come out on top over this place. Don't believe the hype and don't pay to try unless this place cleans up their act. You're paying Scottsdale prices in Tempe with portions from a homeless shelter."
0,"I had a layover in Phoenix on Friday, September 21st so I decided to get some food from Paradise in order to take on my next flight. I ordered 1/2 of the southwest ceasar salad and 1/2 turkey sandwich on wheat in addition to a lemon poppysead muffin. I ate the muffin and salad with no incident. On the plane (after takeoff), I unwrapped my sandwich  and wedged inside the bottom portion of the bread and otherwise not visible unless the entire sandwich was unwrapped was a huge STAPLE. I couldn't believe that there was a staple inside my sandwich. If I had not unwrapped the sandwich and examined it (to determine if there was mayo on it) I could have been seriously injured by ingesting this at 30,000 feet. Take a close look before eating anything from here."
0,"Terrible! is best way to describe the experience at Gado Gado that had me leaving after the appetizer course. After picking through a mixed green salad that was half rotten and slimy greens, I returned the \""homemade\"" salsa that tasted like tomatoe puree out of a can because \""it had no pepper in it.\"" The owner of the restaurant came over and insulted me and said that if I wanted hotter salsa I should have stayed at home. I ultimately walked out and found a great restaurant two doors down at SANTE, which I highly recommend."
1,"Why was I surprised, after all this place has many two star review. I guess because I've eaten here before and thought the food was pretty good. But there's more to a restaurant than the quality of the food. So briefly here's my prob with this place. \n\nFirst, they raise their prices when they feel it's appropriate - Christmas week. Yes, the week, not the day. How do you justify with no additional menu items? Next, Naan is part of the buffet and good but dry - most buffets serve fresh naan at the table. There was no patek paneer - I know, amazing huh? Finally, the plastic silverware was just too much. $15 buffet with plastic silverware!"
4,"My sister & I got services done here and the service is pretty amazing.  In speaking with the owner, who gave me an amazing deluxe pedicure with a hot stone massage, they are fairly new and are striving to provide top service at the traditional nail salon price points ($25++ for a pedi).  They certainly care about if you are happy with your nails and feet and do not let you leave until you say so!  Location is in the corner plaza where 7-11 is, go check them out and get beautified!"
2,"Phew!   All of these Yelp reviews had me seriously worried about arriving at PHX and renting a car, but thankfully, the experience was [relatively] seamless.\n\nI am rather flexible when it comes to rental cars - give me one that gets me from A to B safely, has satellite radio or Bluetooth for music, and is clean. If it happens to be a fun, red sporty version of the above, then all the better!\n\nRed Camero for same price as a Geo - okay.\n\nDrive through check-out was efficient, as was the drop-off.  10-15 minute basic shuttle drive between Hertz & PHX (no wait at either end).\n\nHowever.......with only 3 people in line, and 2 more at front with Hertz reps, a wait of more than 10 minutes seems ridiculous.  Seriously, folks, you are renting a car, not adopting a child.  When another Hertz employee walked through the waiting area, we asked what the chances were to have the \""live help\"" - none, evidently, as the wait was even longer for your digitized live lady as it was for the actually-live people right in front of us.  Okay.  Then it turns out that Gold Members can pass through this absurd process, go downstairs following the non-existent signs and find your name on the board.  Yes, this is what I'm used to.\n\nExcept name not on board.  Damn.\n\nWalked inside the \""Gold Members Only\"" (oh, why do we have to be so pretentious?!), and someone came out to help with \""are you a gold member\""?  I so wanted to ask what the secret password was, but my companions were getting a bit testy.  Yes, I am; just want a car.  \""Is your name on the board\""?  Okay, even if it was, and I was oblivious to the members-only board process, would it hurt you to look my name up anyhow?\n\nNo, not on the board.  \""Oh!\""  Now we're getting serious.\n\nName searched; found; car assigned; directions to car given; car found; check-out; drove on.\n\nTake home message: Sign up to be a Gold Member (it is free), call ahead to ensure your reservation is current (I did so, after reading these reviews), and you should be good to go.  Or, if you don't have to rent a car at all, this is always a great option :-)"

1,"First time we went on this trip the service was great and the food was great too.  We were seated quickly, got our drinks and food quickly.  Loved the Drive Thru Burger.  The Royal Burger was good, but not as good as the Drive Thru Burger.  Don't waste calories or money on the fries.  Just order another burger.  The Nutella Shake was good but not excellent.\n\nMy husband liked our burgers so much that we went back the next day.  It was truly a Jekyll and Hyde type experience.  Everything that was good the day before was awful the next day.  The service was horrible.  We waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and put in our order.  Then about 20 minutes later our waiter comes and tells us that all hell is breaking loose in the kitchen and that it is going down in flames.  They are losing orders and that he had no idea when we were getting our food.  Finally, 1 hour after we arrived, we receive our burgers.  They were just ok...it was like we were in an alternate universe.  Just yesterday they were fantastic and today they were just ok.  So disappointing.  \n\nWe won't be going back.  If they could guarantee that the food and service would be as good as the first time we would go back but since the second time was so awful it just isn't worth it."
3,This theater is at a great location. It is surrounded by restaurants and little shops for a great memorable date. In front of the theater there's a lovely fountain that looks magnificent at night. The little area is also surrounded with lighted trees.\n\nThere's plenty of parking on the side of the theater with lower level parking as well. The theater always seems to be busy so the extra parking is great. \n\nThe theater is always clean and the staff is really polite. Some of the rooms are not upgraded though. I've been to rooms that have had great seats that rock back and then there's some other ones that don't have the upgraded seats and some of them are ripped. I posted a picture so check that out. \n\nIf you want to get a chance to try this theater out for free then there are always free screenings being held here so keep your eyes out for those tickets and contests! No screening on the weekends though :\\
2,"It was decent and quick but nothing to write home about. I thought the Pho was a little over priced at $7.95 but maybe that's me being a cheap ass and expecting Orange County Westminster Pho prices for lunch. The place was huge but hardly anyone there when I say down for lunch at 130PM. Anyway, if your in the mood for pho and are in the area, it's worth stopping by but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
0,"We planned ahead to have dinner here and made reservations the for 6:15 PM before going to the 7:30 PM showing of Dreamgirls at the MAC. \nArrived around 6:20 and was seated immediately. The place was crowded and the service seemed to be a bit slow. We all ready knew what we wanted so we ordered our meal at 6:30 PM. \n\nMy wife and I sat and conversed over hot Jasmine tea. Some time had past and the server came to our table and told us that it would be another 10 minutes before our order would be ready and do we want to wait. I looked at the time and it was 7:10. I told him 'NO, void our ticket. So, we got up and left for the theatre. \n\nIf they were on Top Chef, I would have told them to 'pack your knives and LEAVE'.\nThe food is excellent there, but if you can't produce in a timely manner, then WHY even open.\n\nI think their problem is that they possible have one chef and when the restaurant is crowded, there is NO WAY they can keep the patrons HAPPY.\nThere was a another table with two ladies and they were able to eat just the appetizer.\n\nI hope the owners of the restaurant are reading these comments from YELP because they have to open their eyes to see they are above the heads and NEED to hire another CHEF in the kitchen.\n\nIf there was an option of ZERO stars, that's what I would have rated them."
4,"This is a very late review... \n\n... adian  (sp?), the owner, was very nice and accommodating called around 6 pm but due to unforseen events I came in an hour and half late and he still able to accommodate me smilingly :))\n\nTony... oh. Tony! He did an amazing job with my ombre nails. He actually listened to what design and color I wanted and he executed so beautifully and it with such perfectionism. \n\nOverall, I was really impressed with the service  i got and the end result. I already told my coworkers to come here and they did and they had the same marvelous experience that i had. \n\nanother plus, they open 24hrs. So it's very convenient with me since I work nights and sleep during the day. \n\nFYI: if ur planning to come after 7pm call first and let them know."
0,D-Termination Pest Control sent me three invoices over a year old - two of them were $60 each for two bed upstairs condos - I disputed the charge as it is high.  D-Termination would not adjust as they said they sprayed the outside too.  The outside of a building with four units??  I didn't order that but I have to pay for it??  I do not recommend nor will I ever use them in the future.  Hope that $40-$60 that you overcharged me is worth the future business of a property manager.
4,"Last night I just wanted a quick bite. Being a regular cutomer, I went to Tommy V. To my surprise my bartener, Tabor, recommended a special for the evening. It was called Choppio Frutta di Mare--absolutely delicious--the fish was so fresh. They usually dont have specials, so I was estatic to enjoy something so different and awesome. I hope they continue to have more specials."
4,"First time to use PreFlight and was very satisfied.  Fast, efficient, & reasonably priced. Plenty of parking and when you pay in advance, check out is very fast and simple. Will use them any time I have to fly."
2,This is a solid bar. \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and other stuff. The area downstairs can get a touch crowded but all in all is actualyl pretty comfortable and nice place to while away some time. \n\nWould recommend not sitting near the door in winter as it gets a touch breezy. \n\nIt has started doing food. I had nachos. They were positive. I shall go back.
2,"I used to be a pretty big fan of WF, but I just can't justify spending so much money at the grocery store.  Now I only go there if I need something I can't get anywhere else.  I like their vegan pizzas, though."
1,"Thin, square (that's their gimmick 'our pizza is in a square shape') dry chain-resteraunt pizza that's forgettable. Salads also uninspired."
3,My hair was badly in need of a new dye job.  Lawrence was very attentive and did a fantastic job and gave me a great hair cut!  Price was very reasonable as well.
0,"I wouldn't even give this restaurant one star. The service is so bad, didn't even have time to review the food! Came in with a group of 12 - 4 of them were children aged 6 and under. The restaurant was empty. Took five minutes to get seated. Another ten minutes to order our drinks. The waitress did not smile and say one word to us. She was miserable and did not even smile or say hello or welcome. MAJOR ATTITUDE. We wanted to order the childrens food ahead of time. The waitress, first time talking to us, said the children had to sit at a separate table. What! Two of the children just turned four and clearly needed assistance eating! She then chimed in and said because we were cooking table top BBQ we all had to order the same thing! A couple of the guests did not eat meat so they wanted to order something else. She said it was not allowed. Her tone was not pleasant at all. We got up and left. That was the worst service I have ever had - I don't know how they stay open for business. The are plenty of other Korean BBQ places. Save your time, gas, money and dignity and DO NOT GO!"
2,"Nice red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing, but all the cupcakes had too much icing - sugar and fat overdose!! The guava and cheese pastry wasn't great."
4,"Service is friendly and quick! Everything comes at a timely manner and all the food is fairly priced. Although it's a little small, it's really amazing! The pasta is incredible!"
2,"The food was GREAT.  Since we were there for restaurant week, we were able to enjoy a sampling of their items and loved everything (ceviche, nachos, mahi mahi tacos).  The service was okay.  The food was so good that I really want to give it more stars.  I never thought decor and energy of a place would be such a turn off but sadly, it was for me and Distrito.\n\nMy main issue with Distrito is that the decor is too colorful and busy.  It also seemed too casual (i.e. outdoor seating of picnic tables) given the menu seemed a bit more upscale.  We were seated at a small table inside that had a bright pink glittery top. Alone it would have been super cool but it was too much to take in with the multi-colored and differently designed walls and tables around us.  We asked to move to a table with a normal top which was a table too large for just 2 people.  A couple of the walls and the bungee cord divider reminded us of Easter Basket designs which was strange.  Overall, the place is a bit of an eye sore.  \n\nThe energy level in the place was very low but it was a Monday night and the bartender said it's much livelier Thursday-Saturday."
4,Cornish Pasty if you were a woman I would take you out and treat you right. I would send you flowers and write you love notes. I want you to bear my children and grow old with me. CP call me sometime I miss you everyday we are apart.
3,"Love this place!!!...my jaw did drop to the floor when I saw the ridiculous line, but the wait was worth it!!...Tables were supposedly ALL BOOKED and the hosts wanted to get tipped on top of the $50 covercharge for guys and $20 for girls. The inside of the club is sooo beautiful..almost slipped on the dancefloor a few times though...~\""~..the best part is the pool...I got to soak my feet when they were about to fall off....and the breathtaking view you get of your surroundings...definately a must visit spot in vegas.."
1,"Parking there is a pain in the ass. The ever popular MPD wasted no time in ticketing 10+ cars parked around the corner. The signs read, no parking between 10 PM and 5 AM - hrm, seems be aimed directly at the Bar business. WTF.  Perhaps the obnoxious, money grubbing city of Madison could consider issuing *warnings* first, or make the tickets a nominal fine, like 5 bucks. Oh, we can't do that and still fund the liberal bike boxes, can we ? Or buy snow making machines. So instead of wisely spending money, they'll sock it to people out and about. Way to go Madison. \n\nThe bar itself is fine, plenty of room, except, the bathrooms - they should put in MORE! There were girls in the men's bathroom waiting to use the stall."
4,"I'm going to go ahead and say this is a world class bistro.  But emotionally prepare yourself, because you're going to pay for it.  This was our biggest fanciest meal of the season, and totally worth it.  I ate this meal literally last October, and I still totally remember it.  \n\nThe wine and whiskey list is wonderful and thoughtful.  We started with an appetizer that included mushrooms and a soft boiled egg on polenta and we were already besides ourselves.  We also shared a fantastic little green salad.  Then I had a piece of fish that melted in my mouth with expertly prepared veg, and Mark had pork that he literally was getting emotional about (I know, we are the biggest food-loving nerds ever.  Don't you want to hang out with us?  Don't answer that.)\n\nAfter dinner we went to the bar to have another round and enjoy the cozy atmosphere.  We chatted a little with the chef and just in general felt welcome and comfy.  Love love love love love\n\nAbout the month or so before we went for the weekend to Montreal Food & Wine did a feature on the city's food scene with the usual suspects like Joe Beef and Au Pied de Cochon, and I think Kitchenette was conspicuously missing.  It definitely stands up to some of the raddest, most interesting food I've had in LA, NYC, SF, and all over Europe (back when I had a glamorous job, before I lost my mind and went back to school.)\n\nSo crack your piggy bank and make your reservation."
2,"This place has a couple things going for it, location and its lunch specials.  The food is mostly typical grill fare.  It isn't exceptionally innovative but it meets expectations.  With a little time and the humility to act on recommendations from the Yelp community this place could be another Arcadia fixture."
0,"Progressive insurance does not pay their claims.  I was rear ended by a Progressive insured driver.  I was told by a Progressive agent to get an estimate - which they OK'd - took the car in for the repair when they told me to and then refused to pay.  They are no better than the other company that advertises \""We keep you legal for less.\""  What that means is that you pay the low premiums and they refuse to pay claims!  They are not even within the Insurance Consortium.  Beware!"
1,"Longhorn's motto is \""Welcome to the West\"" but they seem to be more of an east coast chain that has just recently started expanding out this way. This particular location still has that new-restaurant smell on it (even though the carpets were pretty dirty - it looks like this location is popular with families that have a lot of messy kids).  All the decor and finishings looked very new. They have a contemporary feel with nice hardwood and slate tile everywhere but then they throw on a heaping load of western inspired kitch. The atmosphere left us expecting more of a west Texas, mesquite grill but really I would categorize their menu as more of a typical Midwestern steakhouse.\n\nWe started off with a bad first impression since the hostess gave us a fob and asked us to wait in the bar for a table for about 15 minutes. I didn't understand why it would take that long since I could see several empty tables from where we were standing. I got the distinct impression that they were hoping we would wander into the bar and spend more money but since we instead chose to hover around the hostess stand our actual wait was only about 7 minutes. Other than that, the service we received here was very good. Our waitress was really sweet and friendly and very attentive. If only the food had been better, this might become one of our regular spots. My salad was mostly wilted iceberg lettuce and I really didn't eat much of it. My husband's Caesar was a little better but still sub-par. We both ordered steak, assuming that was their specialty. Hubby got the porterhouse which came swimming in melted butter. The mashed potatoes had been likewise shaped into a volcano mound with butter overflowing out of it. It grossed me out just to look at it. He of course ate it all but I just don't know why it needed that much butter since a good porterhouse is well marbled and should have plenty of fat already in the meat. For my entree, I ordered the 7oz fillet. This too had butter all over it but no other seasoning whatsoever. It was very tender but almost too much so. I know you are thinking how can a steak be too tender but it just really affected the texture in my mouth in an unpleasant way. The steak turned to mush after a few bites. They must use a meat tenderizing powder or else they pound the crap out of it with a mallet before cooking. Since the steak was so flavorless, I don't think the tenderness came from the quality of the beef at all. My side dish was the sweet potato bites and in contrast these were pretty darn good. I could have skipped the steak and salad and just eaten a whole plateful of those. Still, I have had sweet potato tots at a sports bar that were equally delicious so I think that is just my love of sweet potatoes talking and not really a selling point for the quality of the food at Longhorn.\n\nI do like the fact that this place offers a good variety of food. There are many options for side dishes and you can add on additional ones at a reasonable price. Also, they have chicken, ribs, and pork chops in addition to the steak. But I would rather go to Firebirds and pay a little more for a meal I know I will love if I am in the mood for this type of food."
0,"Horrible experience resulting in thin, uneven eyebrows.  To have two workers say, \""your eyebrows don't look that bad\"" was the icing on the cake.  I will never come back."
1,The food was ok at best and a bit pricey.  The location of the restaurant is in industrial area off the strip and small.  Even though the restaurant is small there is plenty of room to sit comfortably.  The staff was ok but the food does take a while be brought out.  The restaurant has an offer on Yelp for a free desert if you check in.... make sure you let them know prior to finishing your order if not they will not honor it.  I told the gentleman at the register just as he gave me my total and another guy who was standing behind him said I should have told them earlier.  He made no attempt to honor the offer he just waited for my payment.
0,"If only the food and service matched the looks!  \n\nWhile it looks plain from the outside, Mijana is large and open inside, combining a fairly casual atmosphere with near fine dining visual appeal.  If I was basing this review on the look of restaurant alone, with its tall ceilings and long family-style tables, it would certainly get a 5 star rating!\n\nHOWEVER, Mijana is probably the most over-priced and over-rated restaurant in the entire area!\n\nWith Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food not as popular as Italian and Asian fare, many of Mijana's close competitors shut their doors in response to these tough financial times and I can only guess that this lack of options/alternatives is responsible for Mijana receiving any positive reviews at all!\n\nI have eaten here 4 times.  Twice I went with family, two other times I went with friends to see one of the weekend evening dance specials that people I know were performing in.  While I commend Mijana for supporting local dance talent, the restaurant's primary concern should be supporting the paying patrons!  After 2 tries, my immediate family refuses to return and my friends, except for the ones dancing, have not been back!\n\nEach of the 4 times I have gone, the service has become more and more dispicable and the food has only become less and less edible.  \n\nThe reheated pans of low-grade and truly off-tasting ingredients at the buffet only seem like a \""bargain\"" for the price until you actually try it.  What doesn't get eaten one night seems to get reheated for the next night's dinner service and the next, etc...\n\nThe food off the regular menu is way overpriced in relation to the quality that ends up on your plate.  The dishes are unoriginal and, despite the fact that the stereotypical Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern fare should be predictable, the only thing you can count on is that it's bland and will probably be cold to the touch by the time the server finally brings it to your table!\n\nThe waitstaff is almost always insufficient (a cost-cutting measure by a greedy owner?) with only 2 servers (if you're lucky) working most weekend dinner services.  Speaking of service, it is consistently the slowest I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  Additionally, food items do not arrive together (members of my group were often served at different times and TWICE we didn't get bread for our Hummus appetizer until AFTER we completed the main courses, even though we made the server aware) and that's just the start!  \n\nBringing any issues to the attention of the floor manager simply results in a dismissive attitude and no results...if he is in a GOOD mood!  When he's not, he'll treat you like a dog.  The way my mom and I were spoken to when we asked about drinks (after a 25 minute wait at the table without even water to sip on) was appalling!  And, the servers could care less.  They don't \""serve\"", but they sure don't hesitate to express their upset when the tip is lacking.  You will not leave feeling even remotely appreciated or valued as a customer, I guarantee it!\n\nIf you do decide to dine at Mijana, prepare yourself for a long, expensive night of substandard food and the worst customer care in the Valley!  Unless your friend is dancing there that night or you want to torture your most hated in-laws, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...anywhere else!"
4,This was the beat buffet I've been to in my entire life! The group I was with were not fans of buffets (fancy swanky type) but the y loved the bellagios take on it! We went Sunday for the brunch buffet and the lines are extremely long! You can get line passes from the casino office if you're nice and you ask the right people and move to the invited guest area instantly! The French toast was to die for and beverages are included in the 25 dollar price. You can add endless champagne for just 5 dollars more. This buffet was worth every penny.
4,"AWESOME SERVICE!! MY CRV WAS FIXED AND THEY ARE SUCH NICE PEOPLE!!!\n\nI came in today to get a new power steering pump installed.. Frank welcomed me and he already knew what I was coming in for (I called in ahead). I brought in my own after market pump and they installed it for me with no problem. They told me it will take about 2 hours to get it done but the mechanic, Shane got it done earlier than expected.. I had to wait for the car to get fixed because I couldn't get a ride, so the fast service was greatly appreciated.. My steering wheel is no longer making a noise!!! thanks to jacks and sons.. \n\nI just got home and realized that I need an oil change.. I'll most likely be back soon!..=)"
3,"My wife and I, along with a friend, decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner at 7:00.\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that this is where Stanford U. was holding their pep rally. Place was buzzing with Red and White and shirts with large printed letter 'S'  or 'STANFORD' .\nWalking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was tolerable.\nWe started off with the Waldorf Salad which was AMAZING. The dressing was just the right amount.The acidity in the dressing was just enough to wake up those little taste buds. \nAfter about 20 minutes, the waiter apologized about the service being slow and would comp my wife's wine.\nWe hadn't realize that the time was flying by, 40 minutes had passed and the waiter came over with the dessert menu and said that our whole meal was being comp because they hadn't gotten our main course out to us. He said to go ahead and order dessert and coffee. \nWhen our entrees appeared, my wife had the Roasted Half Chicken which was cooked just right and I had the Herb-Marinated Pork Chop which was cooked medium well. The Apple-Thyme Chutney was sparsely place under the chop, Wishing there was more. The Sweet Potato Mash was wonderful. Our friend had the Filet Mignon which was cooked medium well. He had no problems polishing his plate off.\nWe finished our meals with our Starbucks coffee and apple cobbler which was huge. Even though our meal was comp'd, the food was excellent and we will come back to try it for breakfast or lunch.\nI just found out by reading another review that if you want bread, you have to ask for it."
4,"Thank you to Yelp for this recommendation.  The food was outstanding, especially the Duck Empanada with Foie Gras, as well as the Braised Short Ribs.  Sorry Gabi, but when I eat out, healthy food goes out the window.  Although the portions  on the plate seemed small, we were too full to eat dessert."
1,"We went for a birthday dinner celebration with a party of 9. We called ahead and made reservations with no problem. The atmosphere is great! I loved design of the ceiling in particular. The menu was good and the food was equally good. No disappointments here.\n\nService. Sigh...service was a big let down! We sat at a table and watched a booth next to where we were seated turn over twice before we even received our bill. We honestly felt like because 18% gratuity was automatically being added to our bill (for parties of 8 or more) that the server wasn't interested in making sure we were having an enjoyable meal. \n\nWe had a problem getting separate checks, which I can understand, but all-in-all this is a restaurant I will never go back to and I would not recommend it to anyone. \n\nThe manager, who was apologetic and nice enough, brought a round of shots for the table to make it up. We left the shots. If you wanted to make it right, you would have acknowledged that this could have been avoided had you been walking the dining room to check on the tables instead of manning the host desk and chatting with the 20 something year-old hostesses. I realize it's a difficult job to manage a restaurant, but at least make an effort. Try being proactive instead of reactive and expect that a round of shots will make it right.\n\nI went to Mon Ami Gabi (across the strip at the Paris) for lunch the following day and I was blown away by the service! Fix--you need to remember that people pay for more than ambiance and food, we expect service too, and in absence of that, we will go elsewhere.\n\nThumbs down FIX and do yourself a favor and go have a drink or a meal at Mon Ami Gabi and take notes...take copious notes!!!"
1,"I do love the quick service and delicious food.  McNuggets are my guilty pleasure.  Today, I went and ordered a large iced tea unsweetened at the drive thru.  Another bonus is the $1 drink.  However, the tea was not fresh.  It was gross and I threw it away.  Shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day!"
0,"I've been a loyal Bookman's customer for years. But lately the book buyers at  their Phoenix location have become condescending. Especially the men. I had a bad experience with a short guy with a long, full black beard with grey (?) in it. My family members don't want to trade with them any more. I was the last hold-out, and I don't think I want to either."
3,"One of the best breakfast, lunch spots in town. (at least that i've found) The only one I like better is...well I won't say.  But staff and food are always good.  Wish they had longer hours, that's my only complaint.  I'm a breakfast type of guy and this place hits the mark.  Huge selection even though I always get the same thing.  When I do get adventurous and try something new I'm rarely disappointed."
4,we call it the crack house because they have to be putting something in it to keep you craving for more. Unbelieveably delicious. I'm about to run out right now and get me some more. love love love my caniac. One love. xoxoxo.
2,"If you are looking for something to do, take a break from walking the strip, or take a break from gambling, come watch a movie here!  The theater is really old, a little difficult to locate, not visible from the strip (on the side of Denny's), and the theaters are super small, but hey it gives you something to do other than the usual things in Vegas.  \n\nPrices are movies are definitely a bit pricey.  Staff at the front seem to be friendly.  Not much more to say about a movie theater.  :)  Enjoy."
4,Best Italian food in town! A must if you enjoy special dishes.
4,This is my new favorite place to eat. I am very picky when it comes to my meals. The customized my breakfast skillet into a taco salad. The food is amazing. I no longer want to stop at fast food restaurants. Appetite Xpress food gives satisfaction to quick and delicious food.Try it out! You won't be disappointed! P.S wifi and outlets included...
0,"I have used this business for 2.5 years. They are always trying to get into your pocket and there is always additional work needed.\n I was so fed up with them and their practices and always nickle and dimeing us too death,  this year we purchased 2 new vehicles so we have a warranty and don't need the service of a repair shop besides the servicing dealer!"
0,"I was so excited for The Grind to open down the street from my house. I heard excellent reviews of their Camelback.\n\nA huge let down. Not the best burger. The Grind has a high bar to raise with Local Bistro, Tavern Americano, and Cold Beers and Cheese Burgers in the neighborhood, who all have AMAZING food, service, and burgers.\n\nThe burger was nothing to rave about and the fries were decent. \nI was not impressed by the menu of options either.\nI was especially dissatisfied with the staff.\n\nThe staff:\nThe manager bad mouthed Tavern Americano when they first opened. I found this to be unprofessional and arrogant.\nThe bartender bad mouthed SOL Mexican Cocina after telling her that's where we ate earlier that evening.\nNot sure what the manager and bartender were going for by bad mouthing other neighborhood restaurants to my friends and I but they definitely lost a few customers that were trying  to give The Grind a second chance.\n\nAtmosphere:\nNot sure what  vibe the owner wants, but besides a new name, staff, and menu... it still looks like the old place, Jasper's Peak. \n\n\nI was told they wanted to appeal to a younger crowd, stay open late, and be the neighborhoods lounge. A neighborhood lounge would be AMAZING! I picture something similar to Merc Bar. A burger lounge, open late, an awesome DJ, great drinks, and great hip crowd.\n\nI see lots of potential for improvement all around and hope the pull it together. I love supporting neighborhood restaurants."
2,I had the tuna tar tare and it was not that good they put a little bit of tuna and a gigantic amount of guac on it not to mention it was pretty tasteless
0,"Are you kidding me?\n\nFair warning: I am super super annoyed right now....\n\nI bought a Groupon for this place August 29, 2011 for some underarm hair removal (yes, I'm too lazy to shave my pits) because it was a good deal and close to my home.  When I called for my initial appointment, they did not have anything available until mid-February.  Really?  Fine - I booked.\n\nThen they moved.  Now they are about ten miles from me.  Okay but annoying. \n\nThe first session went well.  There was really no wait time or pain.  I was in and out quickly and booked my next appointment.  \n\nAt the next appointment, they were able to complete one side (one armpit).  Then the machine broke.  It just wouldn't start back up.  Instead of them squeezing me in for the three minute treatment in another room with the other machine, they told me to call and reschedule the appointment.  Again, annoying, but things happen.\n\nThe next appointment to get the other side done was within two weeks but I had to wait in the lobby for a while for my appointment.  Then there was confusion on the client being called back - there were two Katherine's and since I'd been waiting longer and the other Katherine didn't get up, I assumed it was me - of course it wasn't.  When I got back into the room, it turned out that it was the medical office that Simplicity shared an office whith that had called me back.  They brought me back to the waiting room and apologized for the confusion saying they weren't allowed to say last names because of privacy reasons.  What?  Never heard of that.  Whatever.\n\nMy next session is scheduled for May 12th.  Today I get an email that THEY'VE MOVED AGAIN!  Now they are nearly 20 miles from me.  WTH??!!\n\nSo I called, to make sure that I understood the email correctly, that they had moved again (of course no one had told me that they would be relocating during any of the sessions or phone calls).  They confirmed that yes, they did move today.\n\nI very politely said to the girl (she seemed VERY young) that I found this a little annoying that they'd moved once again.  She explained that it would be so much better now since they were not sharing an office anymore and relying on others.  She did NOT apologize. I asked well who can you communicate that to, that I've had to be inconvenienced with the equipment not working and now them moving further and further away?  Is there someone that you can let know?  She told me she would put a note on my file.  I said well, that's fine but will anyone see it?  Then she said, well I'm not really sure what you want to get out of this.  WHAT?!  I said well, all I'm trying to do is lodge a complaint with someone who would care that I've had such an annoying experience but it doesn't appear that is going to happen right now, so thank you.  She told me to have a nice day.  LOL\n\nI still have 4 more sessions to go through for my entire treatment.  I'm pretty bummed so far and can't really recommend this place.  I'm not even sure if the treatment has made a difference yet since I've only had two and supposedly it takes up to six.  :("
3,"Walked in for the first time Monday evening around 9:00 PM, large pizzas in the window and chose Spartan and Herbivore one each to go. Had it re-heated in the big oven which I didn't expect to be done (had the image I needed to microwave myself).\nTasty, huge, and quick, which is a great deal after a long day. I refer to myself as being always hungry and eating more portion than my male coworkers but was not able to finish two pieces.\nGentleman behind the counter seemed shy but very kind. Will try on another time of day with other dishes too.\n4 stars with expectations for future revisit."
4,"LOVE LOVE LOVE !! I cannot get over how much I enjoyed my dinner at the Wicked Spoon.\n\nThe individual servings is such a great idea. The portions are just right, and if I want to go back for seconds, or thirds, I can. I think it's a great way to make sure I do not get more than what I can eat because I hate wasting food. Plus the individual servings keep the buffet neat. The only con is that you are very limited to how much you can fit on my plate.\n\nA macaroni and cheese station !? What a great idea !! I can add whatever I want and it never seems to fail me.\n\nThe bone marrow is delicious. I cannot get over it. Seriously each time I went up for a serving, I always helped myself to some bone marrow. I would go there just for that.\n\nThe mushroom risotto is mouth watering, especially with the wine reduction sauce.\n\nThere's so much I want to comment about and just thinking about Wicked Spoon is making me hungry !!"
3,"Great ambiance.  Very chill, very bright, and even more hipster than cagibi."
0,"I had a molar break the day after christmas (2012). It was a bit painful, so instead of calling my regular dentist I called around to the first place that could fit me in. \n\nIt took 5 visits for my crown. That doesn't sound like much, except one of those was because the crown they ordered didn't fit, so they proceeded to drill it more, until it fit even less, and had to order a new crown.\n\nAfter EVERY appointment I would spend the rest of the day (sometimes days) finding little bits of dental debris in my mouth, such as molding plastic, tooth bits, glue chunks, and excess plastic from my temporary crown. \n\nMy first visit, the dentist gave me my injections then left for half an hour, which by then the anesthetic had begun to wear off, so what did she do? More injections and another half hour break. This happened again, then she finally started drilling. I could still feel it, but I had given up. At her rate my tooth wouldn't have been done until the following christmas. \n\nWhen I finally received my crown, it was placed, and I thought it felt odd. For the first month I tried to convince myself it was just my gums trying to get back into place. For the past 3 months I've realized I probably shouldn't be able to fit floss UNDER the crown. And guess what?? Today it came off while I was eating. Oh, and my jaw hurts constantly because of the crown. \n\nI will be calling my old dentist asap, hopefully the temporary glue I have to get at walgreens will hold me over. \n\nOne more thing, this place is more expensive than other dentists. They managed to blow through all of my insurance allowance just taking care of this. To compare, my regular dentist pulled 2 wisdom teeth, gave me a cleaning, filled 3 cavities, and gave me a crown, and I still had insurance left over."
3,"Great place, a must go if you're in Pittsburgh. The service was lacking, but the sandwich was amazing. Fries and slaw on everything!"
2,I went here for Valentine's day and it was a good restaurant but not great if you want to compare it to some of the top restaurants in town.  The appetizers and entrees are good.  I would recommend the pastas since they are fresh and handmade.  The service and atmosphere were nice but for what I'm paying I could think of a few other restaurants that I would have better overall experiences at.
2,"I don't understand the draw of this place. The atmosphere is fun and staff are great, but the food just isn't that outstanding. I had three tacos: carne asada (meat was tough), shrimp (tastes like algae), and I can't even remember the third which is a bad sign. Also, the prices are such that you're paying at least $1 per bite. I much prefer Phoenix Burrito House which is a better value and has tastier food! OK, I will say the sopapillas here are delicious. I'll give them that."
2,"Had the Roosevelt chicken pan seared. Taste: good. Seasoning: okay (needed a little salt). Consistency on one of the chicken cutlets was a little chewy.  Food came out timely. \nBartender (I ate at bar): cute as can be and friendly, yet not exactly attentive considering only 4 other patrons at bar. He did ask how the meal was but didn't see him again until I was finished.  I needed salt & pepper.\nI'd recommend it as a place to check out.  Unsure if I'll return."
4,"I am really, really loving this new restaurant and must admit I am kinda addicted.  That being said, this review is probably a little altered.  \n\nHonestly, I am not sure what I love the most. I have been there three times now, from a weekday to a Happy Hour and I haven't had any issue with parking.  The wait for a seat was minimal, and the patio was inviting as the bar was fun, and the tables are sooo cozy.  \n\nThe cocktails are GREAT. I am addicted to the one with Ginger, but I can't remember the name of it.  I love the wine being on tap, it's eco-delicious.  I enjoy the company of everyone at the restaurant and I seem to see people I know there most often. The bartenders are a delight, they introduce themselves and talk a lot about the menu and choices, etc.  Even the owner/manager person (whoever she was) came by and asked what we thought of the meals, drinks, atmosphere, etc.  \n\nI also love the wall of tapes, and watching families bike in and get ice cream and sit in the floral decor of the comfortable patio with cute kids...very inviting. I could see bringing a date here (alas I am married now, so my date is my hubby), but I would also bring my parents and my son here.  \n\nI loved the Halibut, the Kale Salad, the snacks, the Sausage Sandwich and I can't wait to go again and try more.  With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist, the burning of Richardsons,  the crowds at Postino, the valet only at the Vig, the lack of fresh salads at the Garage, cold (warm) food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks.  Move over Hula's, SENS, Hanny's, TMI, Rokerij and CIBO! :-)"
3,"A friend recommended me to visit here, and I'm glad I did! At first, I underestimated the size of the arepas here; though they're not huge, they pack huge content and are pretty heavy. Our arepas averaged about $5-6/each. We got a wood fired chicken, pork butt, wood fired beef, and an order of plantains. The wood fired beef was super tasty, while the pork and chicken were a bit salty.\n\nI've never had arepas before, but I became a huge fan after trying these. The \""bun\"" was made of a cornmeal that was grilled, and it was stuffed with a LOT of tasty meats/veggies. The Venezuelan hamburger was filling and also came with two sauces. The pork and chicken arepas got a little wet from the juices inside and started to fall apart towards the end, but were still good nonetheless. The plantains were spot on; warm, toasty, sweet, and delicious. \n\nI'd definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. It's worth a visit and you will want to try everything!"
3,"This place is solid for happy hour. It has a small dining area and a mom and pop feel to it. As others have mentioned, the food is good not great. However, I tend to also look at value for the money. The pizza has delicious thin crust due to the type of oven they have. Toppings are mediocre, they tend to put a lot of sauce and not enough cheese. That said, do you know a better slice of pizza for a buck? I don't. They have very good wings which are usually cooked perfectly and seasoned (sauced) likewise. Sliders are decent too. In this economy a dollar beer goes a long way in my book.\n    The servers have always been friendly to me, I guess I am usually in a good mood when I go out and it shows. I generally do not allow people to give me bad service. \n    The prices are unbelievable during happy hour. 40 cent wings, dollar drafts and tons of daily specials.\n     I would like to give 3.5 stars but will make up for the peron that said the same thing and lowered his to 3 by giving 4 stars. I'm an optimist.\n     See ya for happy hour @ Grimaldi's!"
3,"What an eclectic restaurant! They say they're Japanese and  Malaysian, but they also seem to have Thai and Chinese influences on their menu. I had the Curry Laksa, which is an amalgamation of a traditional curry and pho. It's a large bowl of either egg or rice noodles with beef, chicken, shrimp, and vegetables in a flavorful curry and coconut milk broth. My dining companion got the shrimp hibachi, which was delicious as well. A solid choice in an area of the city known for its Asian food.\n\n* Be sure to look for the Yelp check-in offer for a free glass of wine or domestic beer. :D *"
4,"Our second time here and it has been a 5 star experience on both visits.  It has become a must visit locale on our annual trek to Phoenix. Why?  The food is wonderful, the service attentive and the price points for such extraordinarily prepared and delicious food very reasonable.  The owner/chef and his wife show a great pride of ownership and the diner is the beneficiary of their endeavor.  \nThanks to Nancy who took our reservation, we were seated at the community kitchen table which allows one to see the prep operation, line chef and waiters kitchen interaction-normally an operation that takes place behind closed doors.  This approach makes the staff much more in tune with the food and the patrons they serve.  Approachable, answering questions about ingredients etc., the proximity to the kitchen operation adds a new dimension to ones dining experience.  (The majority of tables are located away from the action if that's not your thing however.)   We love it and recommend trying it!\nThe food... There were no misses!  Two of us had the set menu, four courses for $40.00 that offered all the most favorite dishes mentioned in the majority of the reviews here.  From the salmon to the macaroni-it was well worth it.  One had the pork tenderloin which was moist and flavorful.   I forgot to mention the fine martinis, try the pear martini!  Bookmark this restaurant, pay it a visit and enjoy a great evening.  Very nice and hardworking owners that deserve your patronage for delivering beautiful, flavorful food at a reasonable price.  Bravo!"
4,"Kicked off this cold weather with a bowl of tonkotsu ramen. Had some monta for lunch and got their kuro tonkotsu there but i'll save that for another review. \n\nI expected more flavor from the pork but broth and ramen itself had exceptional flavor I couldn't tell what it was but every slurp of ramen and sip of broth bursted with flavor. The broth coated the noodles fairly well which is what I look for in in a bowl of ramen the side order of corn, nori and egg complemented the ramen like a supporting cast on Broadway. I don't know if it was the soup or the ramen or maybe a combo of both but it almost had a smokey flavor to it. The egg to my surprise was boiled to perfection and tasted like none other I've had before it had a distinctive flavor which I could not make out but it was so good I saved it for for my last bite before I downed the remaining ramen and soup. \n\nAlthough our service was great I was hoping our server had more detailed knowledge as far as what was in the broth and the process it went through and what ingredients was used to make it.  All in all my experience here was awesome, And If you're looking for good service and something to warm you up this season skip china town and make a drive to shoku ramen-ya you won't be disappointed."
4,"I knew nothing of this place till my cousins took me (and one of my other cousins) here for our birthdays. It is located at the very top of the M Resort. The decor is beautiful and the view of the strip and the city are even more breathtaking! If the balcony is open, take a step out there and take a picture. It makes for a pretty awesome photo.\n\nNow, for the food. They've got something for everyone. We started off with a sushi sampler platter. There were six of us, so it was just enough to start the evening. We then ordered the Kobe Beef Sliders, Macadamia Nut Crusted Scallops, and Chicken & Beef Satay from their sharing menu. We ordered two extra Rainbow Rolls. We, also, got a side of fried rice and their mac n' cheese. We just wanted to try a little bit of everything. All the sushi was fresh. The sliders were to die for... nice & juicy. The satay, eaten with some of the fried rice, was right on. The mac n' cheese was ooey gooey and rich. The scallops came out perfect... I hate how sometimes they're cooked to where they become chewy.\n\nTo end the evening, one of my cousins and I were each given birthday chocolate covered strawberries. Now, what girl can resist that?! It was a perfect evening at a perfect place with a perfect view and with some of my most favorite people!\n\nI enjoyed the experience to so much that when my brother and sister were in town, a few months later, the bf and I took them here. I suggested some of the items that I had on my last visit and we, also, picked out a few new ones (the Surf & Turf roll and Godzilla roll, Veloce Poppers, and their Dim Sum). All and all, everything was fantastic! I was glad that the sibs and the bf enjoyed it.\n\nI've yet to go for their happy hour, but I hope that experience is as great as my last two visits."
1,"wow! Came here on my 21st Birthday. the bartender gave me a free birthday drink which he called around the world, it had every type of Smirnoff flavored vodka and the other half was hundred proof Smirnoff, the shot glass looked like Andre the giants coffee mug!!! Don't remember anything after that, but i got 86'd for passing out on the pool table....Just a reminder, Just say no to drinks that smell like butane!"
4,I absolutely love eating desserts and had to try this place after hearing great reviews from friends. I had pretty high hopes going in and was definitely not disappointed!!! \n\nMight be one of the best cakes I've ever had! The cake was perfectly light and airy while the frosting was not too sweet. \nThere are about 8-10 regular flavors you can chose from and I ended up getting the pecan bundt cake. It was delicious! \n\nI would definitely go again and recommend everyone go try it for themselves!
2,went there for dinner because I like to try different buffet.\nfood is really not good. just OK. barely edible. food really deserve 2 stars but they made it up with the ice cream selection.\nI really like the peanut butter flavor and other flavor. I forgot what.\nthis buffet price is really cheap so just come in to eat a few items and the ice cream will be worth it.
4,"Its a Five.\n\nTried it twice and still hungry for more.  Dan, the proprietor, is a great taco ambassador.\n\nHad several different tacos, like the Pastor most.  \nTried lots of other stuff and it was great.\n\nSmall business at its best.\nIce Tea is soon to be on the menu I am assured..., ya?"
3,"Yelp and Guy Feri got it right! Searching Yelp for Chinese in Phoenix directed us to this strange place that somehow works. Rather than being a fusion of both Chinese and Mexican, most of the dishes lean closer to one or the other category.\n\nI definitely recommend getting the combo as getting a regular ends up being very plain (literally just white rice with whatever you choose). \n\nI opted for the vegetarian friendly combo: #2 Chile Relllano and #21 Veggie fajitas with a side of white rice and black beans. The Chile Rellano was deliciously cheesy but the veggies were too oily.\n\nPS. This place is the opposite of eco-friendly, using all disposable dishes and utensils.. Booo!\n\n#vegetarian review"
0,"I spent $30 per dog tag on two tags that were guaranteed to last. Well only one of them made it, the other one fell apart. I called to see if they could just remake the one that broke since they told me it would last. The other one I bought for my other dog is still in perfect condition. \n\n  I don't live super close to this location anymore and the petsmart by me doesn't have this new machine to make them. The manager wants me to come in and show it to him so that he can tell me if it's worthy of a replacement or not because people lie to him and he can't take it back if it was abused. \n\nok, first of all. my dog weighs 4 pounds, how in the world could she abuse a dog tag? \n\nsecond of all, just because some customers have lied to you in the past doesn't mean that I should be punished and be treated like a liar as well.  I spend lots of money at petsmart every year. \n\nI don't think it's appropriate to make me drive all the way to your store so that you can figure out that I am not a liar. In this case, the manager has all the freedom to decide what he wants regardless of the truth. I would be out gas and time if he chooses to say I abused a dog tag or for whatever reason he wants to make up so that he doesn't have to replace $30.\n\n\nI will go in for the last time to fight for my replacement and that will be the last time i step into a petsmart. I will find a new store to be loyal to and spend my money where it is appreciated and they don't assume i am a criminal. \n\nIt would be much wiser to replace a dog tag and earn my respect and loyalty than to lose me as a customer. but maybe they are just doing so fabulous in this economy and don't need my money. i doubt it. \n\nso if you see someone raising hell over a stupid dog tag- its probably me. i will never go down without a fight, LOL! \n\nget over yourself, petsmart."
2,Great atmosphere.  Seating took a bit but we held out even though there seemed to be a lot of open seats.  Food wasn't that impressive.  We both had the eggs benedict.  It wasn't awful -- but wasn't stunning either.  It was close to our hotel so it was a good location -- I'd probably give it another shot but would try something else.
1,"Oh Modern Grove, you were so pretty - yes, you turned my head and I was draw into your inner sanctum - once again, so lovely - a delightful place to hang out and have a beer - like a little section of hipster Santa Monica brought into the desert - as a bar, I would give you 4 stars, but as a restaurant, I'm sorry to say, all style and not much substance.\n\nMore specifically, I ordered the white sauce pizza with the cured ham and the arugula - it sounded good but as I sat down with my glass of green iced tea (I do like the iced tea selection, and they have iced coffee) I read the reviews and fear entered my little foodie heart - things like bland crust and I was thinking - but surely, a place as nice as this realizes what a pizza town this is and would have a light crispy crust...but no, oh my fellow yelpers, if only I had checked with you before ordered...the crust, yes the crust, was doughy and bland. I wouldn't say it was horrible but it seems like it could easily be so much better  - and when I did get the pizza, it just seemed odd that the pizza was cut, and then the proscuitto was layered across it - not the easiest to eat as the meats do not align with the slices - may I suggest putting the ham on and baking it with the pizza and then adding on the arugla and drizzling with olive oil and a little fresh cracked pepper and some shaved parm? I've had this sort of pizza in a number of places and I just think it could be brought up a bit in presentation to do justice to the ingredients.\n\nBeautiful place - would love to hang out here with friends over drinks - just need the quality of the food to be as good as the design of the restaurant."
0,"are you kidding? you can't call yourself a sushi restaurant. we ordered several rolls . sashimis, spicy miso soup, teriyaki chicken bento for my son and some salads. the rice on the rolls were seasonless. the fish used on the rolls were so thin and insignificant that it was just rice balls. the shrimp was so over cooked and rubbery as well as the chicken teriyaki. I will not eat here again.sorry"
4,"Don't worry about price- this place is quality over quantity and worth every cent!!\n\nRelaxed, clean, friendly environment with the sweet undertones of jazz and blues music playing in the background as the sweet sound of tattoo guns hum through the shop.\n\nAmazing artists, celebrity guests, and Joey 'Hollywood' Hamilton! He is amazingly down to earth, friendly, and deserving of the title \""Ink Master.\"" The shop owner is equally as good of an artist, and his wife is outgoing and friendly.\n\nWhether it's the gift of a tattoo, like it was in my case for my fiancee, or looking to add another piece, this is the shop to end all shops. I don't care who your artist is- they can't hold water compared to this place."
4,One of our local favorites!  Great food and coffees.  Friendly staff and owners.
0,"Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine. Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment. I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days. I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday!! At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done. I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California, intending to wear my newly fixed jeans, and they said it wasn't ready. They hadn't even started on it. They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it, which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour. I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again. 0 stars."
4,Wow what a great environment and what great service by everyone in the shop. You really can't go wrong with any of the artists you choose to work with there but Jake is my tattoo artist and he has done a brilliant and amazing job on the two pieces he has done on me. :)))))\n\nThe place is super sterile and open and airy (there are privacy curtains upon request). I love being able to look at all the great artwork surrounding the room. It also gives a sense of community in a way because everyone is showing off their artwork and exchanging stories. \n\nI always leave happy and beyond satisfied :))
4,"The service here is incredible. The good is always fast and delicious. Even better is the conversation and the culture. To my boyfriend, who is from Detroit, it's like going home. \n\nMy favorite is the hot fries, but they have an excellent menu with something for everyone. \n\nThe owner always remembers us and even sat down with is to talk about Detroit. Love the food and most of all, the people."
2,"Food: 3/5\nService: 3/5\nCleanliness: 3/5\nDecor & Setup: 3/5\n\nI like this place because it is cheap. But its an average place.  For kids, its great because of the circus acts and the buffet.  Don't mind coming here when my wallet is low."
1,"Not my cup of tea. I came here after a long day of business hoping to avoid the old Denny's fall back, but I think I actually would of preferred to eat at the classic dinner. The food at Eli's was only okay, service was poor (but passable because I was in no rush), and there was a band playing oldies which made the environment different than I would like. I suppose it's not bad as a bar, I was under the impression it was more than that and came to eat, which at my current state was a mistake."
0,Absolutely terrible customer service. By far the WORST I've ever experienced at any post office. Rude employees. When I called they seemed angry at me for doing so. I am forced to deal with them because they supply mail to my area and route. Word to the wise use FedEx or another carrier. Maybe this review will be a wake up call to these wonderful government workers.
0,I guess I had the same experience Shawn did.  I called and got a very nice and courteous person on the phone.  I believe it was Martin.  He told me he would stop by and give me an estimate and that was the last I heard from him - 4 weeks ago.  I guess he wasn't too interested in maintaining my yard.
1,"Happy Hour 4pm-7pm is the PERFECT time to dine at RA for sushi. Should you decide to dine at RA.\n\n3 gals with an alcoholic bev and enough rolls to roll us home and the total bill was $41 and change.  This was a nice bargain.\n\nBUT.... the 2 stars state it perfectly \""Meh. I've experienced better.\""  That pretty much says it all.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special that makes me want to go back, so I probably won't unless I am shopping in Kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen. \n\nService was good.  It was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  With plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking \""ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha\""-- I don't know.  But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots."
2,"In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par.  A poor testimony to mandatory gratuities.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food here is above average and within our party of 5, nobody complained about the food.  I had Eggs Benedict and they were very good.  And, I just don't think you can complain about the venue; it is in a fantastic location and well maintained.  We've eaten here twice now & both of those things have been consistent.  And, for the location & quality of food, the price point is fair.\n\nAhh, but there is a catch.  Their service is poor.  The girls up front must be the manager's daughter's friends or something.  I stood there for over 5 minutes after our initial conversation before I got a response & then, only after I asked (for the 2nd time) where my party was going to be seated - and during that time, the only person to even come to the station was a person on the way out to make a quick comment.  I was early and on a mid-week day, so there wasn't a lot of traffic.\n\nTurns out, they don't open the patio until about 9 am.  So the little girls at the front, had me sit at an inside table (even though I requested a patio table & was told it was 1st come / 1st serve & I was there at 8:45 & I told them the rest of my party would not be there until at or after 9 am).\n\nWhen everyone arrived at about 9:05, they asked if we could sit outside, so I asked the bartender who to ask about that & he pointed me to the floor manager who arranged it.  This, of course was an unnecessary move, but whatever.  I left a good tip for the waitress who had served me coffee (only) and moved to the patio table.\n\nLater, after I received my meal, I asked my waitress for a condiment & she seemed pleased to get it.  Later, when it had not arrived and my meal was getting cold, I reminded her again & she acknowledged that she had forgotten.  Yeah, I never got that condiment.\n\nWhen I got the bill, an 18% gratuity was added to the bill.  Now, a couple of comments on that.  1st - the waitress told me the bill included the gratuity & that was fair of her - i've had that before, of course, but I do feel like they're trying to see if you're paying attention if they don't disclose it.  2nd - 18% is less than I typically tip for good service - but in this case, I would have tipped less, our server didn't deserve more, for sure & since I assume they share tips with the greeters, it surely would have been less.\n\nSo, in my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."
4,The food was delicious! The service was awesome! Highly highly recommend! Thank you very much and we (all 19 of us) will be back the next time we are in Vegas!
3,"If you like your gyros full of meat and not lost under a salad, then this place is for you!\n\nThis is the real deal, the gyro meat is tender and full of spices, and cut fresh from the spit to order.  Not the reheated or grilled meatloaf some places try to pass off as gyro meat.  The pitas are warm and are more than able to keep the abundance of ingredients in check.  The tzatziki sauce is a bit runny but with lots of dill...Restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly.\n\nI have been coming here for years, and will continue to do so."
1,"I would say this is closer to a lower end 4-star hotel than a 5-star hotel.  Although the building is nice and the rooms are well-appointed, there are a few drawbacks bringing down my rating.  When we checked in, the room wasn't cleaned properly.  It appeared to be clean at first glance, but then we noticed that the floor wasn't vacuumed (we actually found a piece of broken glass on the floor as well as what looked like food crumbs), there was hair in the shower drain, and the mirrors had smudges all over them.  I would expect this from a 2 or 3-star hotel, but not  from a 4 or 5-star one.  We gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt and decided to see if they would clean the room better after our first night.  When we returned to our room the following evening, it looked like they spent 5 minutes in there.  The beds were sloppily made; the floors, mirrors, and bathroom counters weren't cleaned; hair remained in the shower drain and they took the tip I left as if the felt they deserved it.  I wanted it back after seeing the disappointing work they did.\n\nThe toiletries they provided were also bad.  First, they come in hideously large, thick plastic bottles that are far from eco-friendly.  Second, the actual product they provide are some of the worst I've experienced.  Luckily I brought my own shampoo and body wash, so all I had to use was their horrible conditioner.  \n\nAside from the cleaning staff and the poor products, the rest of the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful.  And the hotel is in a great location."
3,"I really love the chicken and tuna salad.  Goes very nicely with their sweet tea.  Good sevice and good salads, and an overall trendy and upbeat atmosphere.  I would recommend it definately.  Plus the staff is eally nice too."
3,"Nice course. I'm guessing it's much nicer in the spring or summer. After the heavy rains, we were cart path only the entire round. The fairways are very nice and well kept, but very brown. The greens were kept green and were fast. Well designed and was quite challenging. Unfortunately our outing was with 40 degree weather and 40 mph winds. Not too much fun weatherwise. It seemed as though we were hitting into the wind the entire round. \nHad a nice pro shop and clubhouse. The club rentals were also pretty nice (Nike)."
4,"I had Anna and she gave the BEST massage ever! I have paid expensive spas and I have never had a better massage then from this place for only $20/hr! I want to go back to Vegas just to book her. Tips are important and I understand why. She is honestly worth a $20 tip. Next visit, I want an appt each day."
3,"Damn you sushimon, you got me good!  Was it the language barrier or you couldn't hear me behind the glass at the bar?  I specifically asked for HALF orders of 4 different rolls as my last and Final order of an hour long, sushi binge.  But what do you give me? 4 WHOLE rolls.  OMFG #gag#barf.  How am I supposed to finish this?!?  I wanted to cry, really.  Another hour and a half later or so, I slowly consumed everything...you did not defeat me this time around but I dare not challenge you again."
2,"If you're attending a show at the Las Vegas Convention Center, it's hard to beat the Westgate for convenience. You can walk from the hotel to the show floor in under fifteen minutes. \n\nThat said, the Westgate is still figuring out what it wants to be. Under new management, the staff seems reinvigorated and focused on making your stay a great one. There's still work to be done, primarily in the room upgrades and the dining options, but I loved the enthusiasm of the team trying to make this a better option for Vegas travelers.\n\nI stayed in the North tower in one of the renovated rooms, and it was quite nice. Yes, the two beds were only doubles, but the bedding was soft and clean and I had a beautiful view of the mountains to the east. My shower worked great, with hot water available immediately and good drainage in the tub. (Colleagues in the East tower didn't fare as well on that front.)\n\nOne interesting option at the Westgate is the \""Go Green\"" incentive. You can push a \""Green\"" button on your phone and opt out of housekeeping services for the day. For this, you get a $10 voucher good for food/drink in the hotel during your stay. This service is not available on check-in or check-out days, so I only used it once, but I absolutely loved it. Bonus - it paid for my coffee at Fortuna (as well as the guest in line behind me) the next day.\n\nWait times at registration and the taxi stand were never more than five minutes, but the Paradise Cafe fills up for breakfast, so be prepared to wait during peak times. (A better option, grab and go from Fortuna, plus it's open 24-hours.)"
1,"Good food, even better beer, but absolutely atrocious service. I actually got concerned that I had truly become invisible and got worried. Nope, hadn't. Just incredibly ignored. Not just a one time deal either. Shame being that what they have to offer is so good."
1,"Place is super cheap and need tons of Upgrades. We thought we were getting a cheap price but came out to a lot. Extra fees like anywhere else. When we walked in the room the rugs looked so bad I didn't want to take my shoes off, sink was clogged, shower wasn't working and I found random hair on the bed. Walls are paper thin so you can hear everything... everything. Staff was nice and helpful. All in all you get what you pay for. I'll save my money for a nicer hotel."
4,"I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend, so I knew I had to get it taken care of that day.  I called and spoke to Todd, who told me it might be a bigger job than they had time for, but told me to bring it right over and he'd see what he could do. \nI'm SO glad I brought it there.  Three men worked together to quickly diagnose the problem, go get the part I needed, WASHED the car while they were waiting for the part (just to be nice!!) and solved my problem in about an hour.  The price they charged me was much less than I expected, and I can honestly say it was the BEST car repair experience I have ever had.\nPlease take your car to these guys with confidence.  There's just no way you'll regret it."
3,"As you probably know, Edinburgh can be quite upmarket compared to other similarly sized cities, and the proliferation of wine shops or \""vintners\"" as I think is the correct term, is perhaps a sign of this. It seems to permeate even to the tramps, as I've noticed discarded bottles of Blossom Hill both in the alcove at Fleshmarket Close and outside Waverley steps. A couple of weeks ago I was also asked for spare change by a hobo who was both better spoken and more smartly dressed than myself.\n\nAnyway, I digress, Edinbuggers love their wine, and while this store isn't in itself the most upmarket or well stocked, the fantastic pirate-themed name always makes me smile. Aar."
3,"I was very excited...then deflated.  Not three days ago I dined with Fleur by Hubert Keller at Mandalay Bay.  The Chicken Sandwich was very good, albeit the bacon didn't exactly join the sandwich, rather rested atop the cheese and would fall out if not careful.  The French Fries, yes French Fries were perfect and so was the Ocean Blue drink.  Service was attentive and the venue very welcoming, mind you we noted a team member neglect to wipe down two of the tables.  With Brunch, I give Fleur a solid 4 Stars, 5 Stars had the tables been cleaned correctly.\n\nOnward to Tech.\n\nUpon arrival our Server presented an iPad with the menu.  What a great way to quickly browse a menu and gather details.  Additionally, the iPad immediately felt cleaner than the typical menu that passes patron to patron.  I wish every venue would use iPads, or Galaxy Tabs for those of us (myself included) that prefer Android.  Now for the bad news.  Upon selecting menu items, the app states \""To place order, share this screen with Server\"".  Being entirely honest, 10 minutes were lost searching the menu for the \""share\"" functionality.  Screen after screen, button after button.  Problem solved - who would guess \""...share with Server\"" at Fleur actually means physically show the iPad screen to the Server!  Half-Hearted Tech?  When \""Share\"" is presented in an application, most people anticipate sending the order from the iPad to the POS terminal (or Facebook, or well, wherever!).  The ordering confusion may only apply to some of us, but one of two things needs to happen: the verbiage on the screen must change, or the integration to the POS terminal must be completed.\n\nEnough tech bruising, Fleur is a delightful restaurant and the mere courage to implement such technology warrants praise."
2,"I've only used them once for a jacket in October 2013. They did a great job of dry-cleaning my jacket and it was ready when they said it would be.\n\nThree-star rating stems from the staff not being the friendliest and that they do not accept American Express- my preferred payment method.\n\nThat said, I would not hesitate to use them again and I will update this review the next time I do."
3,"Okay so I have been on a crazy ramen kick these last few weeks.  I can't seem to get sick of it, which really needs to happen soon because all this sodium is not condusive to my eating clean and healthy.\n\nI know I said in my Sora review that I probably would not go back to Monta after falling in deep and passionate love with my bowl of ramen at Sora, but I wanted to eat by myself today and I knew if I went to Monta, I could probably get a seat quicker than at Sora since Monta has the counter-top seating.  I used to go to Monta every Saturday for lunch by myself and noticed that there were a lot of people who like to eat there by themselves, which makes it easier and faster for me to get a seat.\n\nToday was so busy!  So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. They only have a couple of servers who also double (triples?) as hostesses and bussers so these ladies are running around like crazy.  Like Sora, I just find myself exremely impressed at how quickly they turn tables over without making you feel rushed when you're eating.  I love to sit at the counter-top and watch them making the ramen.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat a little bit when I've been there on Saturdays, but today he was constantly running around getting those delicious bowls of steaming ramen out of the kitchen.   \n\nAnyway, I don't have anything against Monta.  I just think Sora is way better.  However, I did leave there today feeling extremely happy and satisfied.  I always get the Tonkatsu-Shoyu with chasyu and nitamago.  One bowl of ramen is usually more than enough for me.  If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.  Today, however, I decided to try something new and adventurously ordered the kimchi fried rice.  Not sure why regular fried rice comes in a small and large, but add some kimchi to it and you can only get one size, which is a large serving.  But I'm glad I got it because it was freakin' wonderful!  The seasoning is just perfect and the kim chi is just subtle enought that it doesn't overpower the fried rice taste.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!\n\nI still can't help but compare my ramen at Monta to my ramen at Sora, and though it falls short, I still really enjoy Monta as part of my ramen rotation and will continue to go there every once in a while."
0,I placed a carry out order got all the way there to pick it up and was told they didn't have crust. Really you're a Pizza Hut. There was no one manager there to talk to I will be calling back on Monday after 4 as Terrance told me. Very disappointed and will make the extra drive from now on. At least I will get to deal with professionals that dare about there brand.
0,"I'm only giving one star because I have too. I have been coming to this car wash for years and I've always thought highly of this place and the owner. I referred my good friend to this place for a mini detail, and payed for it myself to show him how good this place is. When he picked up his car they jammed his key in the ignition and could not get it out. They took no responsibility for it and the owner told us it's not her problem. Then when we took it to honda to get fixed, they informed us they got a sensor wet underneath the shifting council and now that needs to be replaced as well. I am definitely taking them to court."
4,"Awesome work, fair prices and great customer service. The whole crew is professional, especially Mike. He's warm, friendly and will go into detail about anything you might not understand or have questions about. And he always picks up his phone, even when he's off the clock!!! Guy works too hard hahahaha."
2,"I was surprised to see the amazing ratings that Bluebird Kitchen has on Yelp and just had to try the restaurant when I started working downtown!\n\nThe restaurant is extremely busy during the weekday lunchtime hour. During the two times that I've been, the line is at least 15-20 people long. I recommend planning to get takeout since seating is very limited.\n\nI have tried the Chicken Salad sandwich, House Roast Turkey sandwich, Chocolate cookie \""sandwich\"" filled with a Pistachio cream, and a Chocolate Strawberry cupcake. The Chicken Salad sandwich was good but a little too heavy, and I ended up throwing half of it away. I wasn't expecting much from a basic turkey sandwich, but the House Roast Turkey was amazing! I will definitely be ordering that sandwich again sometime soon. The desserts were disappointing, especially for the high price ($3.50 for the cupcake). Though I liked the concept of the two, both the chocolate cookies and cupcake were very dense, while the icing on the cupcake was too rich and tasted like butter. I will not be trying their cookies or cupcakes again.\n\nOf the four things I've tried, I would only re-purchase one of them. Based on this, I can only give the restaurant 3 stars. However, I definitely plan on trying Bluebird again and will re-review if I have a better experience in the future!"
0,"$23.99 I had to finish wiping down the dashboard, cup holders weren't wiped out at all. Floor boards were kinda vacuumed. Rear of SUV wasn't cleaned at all but I was charged extra for the size of my vehicle. :("
4,What a great menu!! The breakfast and the burgers are awesome! More than your money's worth for sure.
0,"Ugh!  This place used to rock. The Armenian salad was super salty, the steak in the #7 tastes like it had been marinated in soy sauce and was not very tender. The chicken had a rubbery quality to it. I really root for small business, especially when they put out an awesome product. Even with the restaurant.com GC, it wasn't worth it. Zaytoon puts out a much better product. I'll probably come back here, but probably not until 2014."
4,"The food here is fantastic.\n\nWe started off with the jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, and the truffle fries for appetizers. The dips for the fries were delicious! I really liked the vanilla powdered sugar on the sweet potato fries because the sugary sweetness was such a unique addition to FRIES. The poppers came nicely plated in these shot-glass dishes and were tasty as well.\n\nMy friend and I exchanged the halves of two burgers so we could try more variety. I had both the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Farm Burger. The patties were cooked to a lovely medium rare, the buns were fresh, and the individual ingredients for both burgers blended together nicely. In my opinion, I liked the Hell's Kitchen Burger slightly better though because of its lighter and more refreshing flavor. Don't get me wrong, the Farm Burger was great in its own way. You can really taste the duck bacon along with the savory egg and cheddar combo.\n\nThe service was very attentive and er.. pretty attractive in its own way haha\n\nIf I ever come back to Las Vegas (hopefully soon!), I'm totally coming back!"
0,Great for kids haircuts. Terrible for adults. Never going again
1,"Pricey. Old. Haircut belonged on an old fart. Okay, I was in the area and really needed a cut, it was early morning and there was no line so I thought what the heck. First bad vibe was everyone in a chair and walking in had gray hair, and I swear three of four had loafers with no socks and shorts. \n\nA guy named Gisuppee took me and he might have been the owner. Asked me what I wanted and then cut a bit off the side, and then had me look and said he would make the top match. \n\nHe cut my bangs straight across and it looks like i had a bowl cut, however he did a nice job on the back including a razor cut. That was not enough to justify the 22.00 price tag. \n\nWhen I tried to pay he informed me they only took cash. I had to walk across the lot to a bank and back. \n\nI have had better cuts at the chains for half the price. I will not be back."
3,I brought 3 pairs of shoes here on the recommendation of a co-worker. I am so glad I did. All 3 pairs were heels that needed to be re-tabbed. I dropped them off and a week later they were ready for pickup. Not only were they were re-tabbed but polished up and looking almost new. One pair are 8 years old that you would never know were that old! Shoes that would have been relegated to the trash heap including my favorite black Guess strappy sandals now have a new lease on life. \nCost is only $10 a pair and worth every penny! You will not be disappointed.
3,I eat at the peppermill almost once a week - I would give the food 3 stars because it is average all around. The atmosphere gets 5 stars and makes it a must visit when coming in to Las Vegas. Stop in have a drink and share your meal with a friend!
1,"This place is a complete hit or miss in my opinion. I've eaten here about 5 times now, so I feel I can give an honest opinion of this place. First, let's get some of the obvious cons out of the way. Parking is awful. After the first two times here, I've completely given up on parking my own car, and have resigned myself to the Valet (Which is Complimentary, but who are we kidding, you don't not tip valet). And the seating situation is awkward at best. The space is so open, that you're constantly accidentally catching other peoples eyes, and the lack of walls makes it so you can barely hear your neighbor sitting next to you! Now, on to the more complex issues. The Wait staff is a big issue in my opinion. Of the 5 times I've been there, I've only once had a waiter I felt did an adequate job. They are not good with refills (You pretty much have to ask every time you want another drink), and are weirdly...flirty. Some of the waiters rather openly flirt with customers, which can make for uncomfortable silence at a table as you awkwardly try and avoid watching the sad attempts at getting a better tip taking place in front of you. The staff is also invasive. I get that not everyone wants a silent waiter who only pops up to refill drinks, but I think most people can agree it's weird when your waiter jumps into the middle of a conversation you're having with your table, and try's to put in their opinion. There was one instance where one of the female waiters actually sat down at our table and tried to have a conversation with us.... Again on the wait staff, YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS YOURS! You'll have 4 waiters ask if you've had your order taken, 3 that (Finally) deliver it, and at the end of the night the waiter that brings you your check wont even be the original waiter you had at the start of the meal! The Food, I will say, is good. I haven't had anything there where I've thought \""Wow, this is gross\"", and I do love their cheese fondue appetizer. Overall, I think most of this places issues come from it's lack of training, and lack of professionalism from the staff. If that one thing could be improved on, I think I could ignore the lack of privacy, and mandatory Valet parking."
1,Monti's is undergoing a large construction project which impacts the interior smell. We had to ask to move as the odor of paint thinner was dimming everyone's brain.\n\nI'll wait until after summer to re-try.\n\nThe shrimp salad is so-so.
1,Always such a long wait for your food.  I tried several all times to go for lunch and you end up getting food late and it's cold.
2,"Shopping here makes me long for my Trader Joes back in Tucson at River and Campbell. There are four in Tucson and only one had killer produce. I don't have another choice here, and so I go. Too often though I'm met with wilted greens and beans that have seen better days. It's not a \""past its prime\"" sort of thing... it's a \""the produce just isn't as good as I'd like\"" sort of thing. I dig the layout, there is an abundance of staff, but if I'm being completely honest, nobody says hello, asks if you need help finding anything or is quick to make a tasty suggestion... the reasons I don't mind spending $5 on a bag of salad. I'll still go because there are things I can't get anywhere else (love the laundry detergent and price of organic taters) but it'll never be a place I do all my shopping unless the greens get better."
3,The lunch buffet is no more. Boooooo.
1,"give the choice between this Taco Bell... I'd take Taco Bell any day of the week. \nThe food was Hot, but that's really it. \nand I don't mean spicy, I mean tempture wise. \n\nThe chips were about a day shy of stale, and the carne asada was so tough I could hardly bit all the way through it. \n\nFor Las Vegas being known for their quality cusine, this is a BAD example. \n\nI don't think my husband and I will be staying at Circus Circus ever again, so hopefully we won't be forced to eat here again."
2,"This place is easy to get to off interstate and The Bagel Man is right next door! Overall this Golds is older with the classic metal weights but a great set of heavy dumbbells. The machines are all older, no new equipment here and some alway seem to be broken or totally wore out. I do feel its spacious and you have plenty of room to move around without being on top of other members. \nThe cardio section is limited with 4-5 StairMasters, couple Ellipticals, bikes but a huge row of treadmills 20+ all stationed in front of several flat screen TVs above the gym floor. \nThere is the standard group class room which also boasts some tires, battle ropes, TRX and other functional training equipment. Child care center as well. \nMens locker room is good size with Dry Sauna room, 6-7 showers. \nIts a good place to train but no frills or high end amenities. This gym is comparable to Las Vegas Golds on W. Lake Mead (- the mma cage) but I actually prefer this AZ location."
1,"Unless you are a complete Vegas drunk with no where else to go, well, I guess that's your spot. Loud, obnoxious and greasy. That is about the very best I can offer to this crowded, loud, very dirty spot. The food was microwaved, and greasy. I just won't go on, except avoid it."
0,In need of updating.  Very 1983.
1,"We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star."
2,"We all know that this is not authentic Chinese food. But hey, Panda Express has been around for years and I have always liked them because they are cheap, fast, and their food keeps me full!  \n\nThis location isn't too bad. There are many parking stalls outside and the restaurant is clean. However, I do feel sorry for the employees who are working here. It seems like every time I stop by, there is only one employee behind the counter who has to deal with a long line of customers and no one else is around to help out. But even under all that stress, they try to be friendly and are always asking if I would like to sample any entrees. \n\nThe main problem with Panda Express is that you don't know how long the food has been sitting there, and they don't make a fresh batch until they run out of something. Sometimes the fried rice is dry, the egg rolls are not crispy, and some of the other entrees may lack flavor. \n\nOver the years, I have become a fan of Pick Up Stix. But since they don't have any locations here in Vegas, Panda will have to do for now."
4,"This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy."
3,"The store, as other yelpers indicated, is definitely nice, exceptionally so for a grocery store.   It is a diamond in the rough for those of us who loath shopping with soccer moms during peak hours.      I have often found myself purchasing a case of Blue Moon, dog treats, shampoo, and cheap but gentle toilet paper at 2 am.  Pathetic?  Yes.   Convenient...Definitely."
1,"Land of the $20 bottle of Heineken. Yep, you read that right: TWENTY DOLLARS. If I didn't need to drink that crappy beer to muster the mental stamina to keep myself composed amongst all of the crappy music and creepy men, I wouldn't have paid that. I've decided that this is where I am going to spend a lot of time if/when I finally completely give up on having any faith in humanity and human decency."
0,not a fan. they held the vip guestlist line until 11pm and when we got inside there was NO ONE in the club. there was open bar and drinks were strong. kind of shady crowd....we think one of the girls we were with was roofied. we won't be coming back.\n\nthe only good thing about this place was the ladies' room. it was very nice.
1,"I went here for a late lunch today and was not very pleased when I left.  The food was pretty good - the onion rings I had as an appetizer were really quite good.  My main gripe was the service - terrible is the best way I can describe it!  Our drinks were never refilled by our waitress, we had to ask another waitress for them, and when it came time for our check, the entire paying process took over 15 minutes.  I could understand if the restaurant were swamped, but we were one of maybe 10 tables in the entire restaurant.  It may have just been bad luck as to who we had for service, but it really dampened my overall experience."
3,"52 bones and 38 muscles, what once were two whole parts of my body are now falling apart into little pieces and I feel every single one of them after a log day at work standing on my feet. I've used and been loyal consumer of every Dr. Scholl's foot product he ever invented that he would probably be upset if he ever finds out I'm putting my feet on someone else hands. but I came to the point that I have to add two more hands on the care of my always tired feet.\n I went to the good foot spa looking for Joyce, recommended by a yelper friend, but she doesn't work there any longer so I asked for the second best. Kathy did a wonderful job, I can't say she's the best since this is my first foot massage but anything better than this would have probably been illegal. They have a 30 minute special but I opted for the 45 minute service which at the end given the prep and this and that you really get about 35 minutes of actual massage and even though I was there for the foot massage she started from the top of my head all the way down to my arms and legs covering about 99 percent of my body, (missing under the chin if you really have to know) while my feet soaked.\n It was early in the morning when I went there, I think it was just me and one other person in a different room being slapped around or at least that's what I made out from the sounds and the moans that I could hear clearly since there was no mood music. I didn't want my mind to go wild so I put on my I pod and listened to my own music, Maria Callas to be exact, her screaming was way more relaxing than the guy's next door.\nYes, there's a little of that language barrier, but at the end, the massage language is universal, besides I grew up at the barrio and being an expert on sign language came pretty handy for me. I really had a very relaxing experience, my feet felt like new and so did everything else she put her hands on.  I was really surprised how great it feels after after a good foot massage. Highly recommended, I'm sure I'll be back, I can get hooked on this.\n  No more peanut butter on my feet after work......sorry solin. (my dog)"
4,"I have been a fan of this place since it opened. The Tequilaria style is a big plus for me, because it allows me to get my favorite beer with my \""fatty tacos\"". I normally have to get the same thing because it is one of those places, when you find what you like, why change? (carnitas tacos)\n\nAlthough they have a larger selection when it comes to entrees, meats, and toppings than Chipotle. Everything from Mahi Mahi, to shredded or grilled steak. \n\nGoing there for games if great, because they always have  3 large HDTVs above the bar. Little secret of the trade, if it is a slow Sunday/Monday/ect. night you can get them to play Rock Band on their PS3. \n\nOh yeah, and the other Wednesday night I saw they were holding some kind of Madden Tournament, I think. Pretty cool to have in a bar I thought."
2,"Let me start by saying I've been a really big fan for years, it was my #1 Indian food.  Today was a total meal of mediocrity at the buffet. Began with the fried veggies which were both cold & unchewable. Then so happy to see Chicken Korma until I realize it's thigh not breast. Chili Chicken very good as was the Garlic Naan but the rest was totally \""off\"" for me today. Will now search for another #1. Forgot to mention this was straight up Noon & last visit a couple weeks ago was not good either. Is it just me or do others think Tandoori Chicken should be a bit crispy on the outside?"
3,I like it. Veggie friendly too.
1,"from a visit a few months ago....when it was still hot outside\n\nI had the bahn mi dog w/ fries. it was very good.\nonly major complaint was that the A/C was not working in the restaurant, so it was VERY hot."
4,"Stopped here to pickup snacks on our way to CA. The store carries almost everything desired from a super Indian grocery store - Snacks, staples, vegetables, fruits and exotic items. The great surprise was their mini restaurant, that offered wide collection of sweets and snacks. I highly recommend their Thali. It is closest to the home cooked (North) Indian meal I had in the US. I live in NYC, so that's a major compliment! \n\nVisit this place with huge bags and empty stomach, and carry out as much as your body, bags and car can carry."
4,"Great food, pleasant service and very fresh weekend buffet with a wide selection of choices. The carrot dessert is insane. And they're very nice to kids here."
0,"Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again."
3,"Of course, my boyfriend and I wanted the lava bowl.  Nothing sounded more delicious than fresh-tasting octopus, shrimp, fish, and mussels in a cheesy, creamy sauce.  In a lava bowl.\n\nOur molcajete arrived hot and bubbling, and after a few bites, kicked in with a burn-your-lips-off hot spice that I couldn't love more.  It's more than enough to split, so keep that in mind when looking at the (somewhat-higher-than-typical-Mexican-fare) prices.\n\nTortillas tasted fresh, the guac was solid, and chips were the crispy, oily, delicious kind I adore.  The on-table salsa is kickin' and delicious.  What San Diego Bay lacks in ambiance, they more than make up for with flavor.\n\nAnd really, what more do you want from a Mexican restaurant?  A bucket of Coronas for $12??\n\nSan Diego Bay's got you covered all around."
0,"They must figure that the old people who go here have no taste buds.  The service was good but pretty cheesy, all pomp and glory for the newly wealthy.  Should have known that we were stepping back in time when half the menu is Veal.  The food was terrible and that is really how I rate a restaurant.  Dryed out fish and chicken covered in salty sauses but the portions were big which explains the clientele.  egg drop soup was good though, very italian:)  If you go dont forget your AARP card and leave your appetite at home."
0,"normally i do not venture to party outside of my central phoenix neighborhood. but i jumped at the opportunity to see faux punk, a daft punk dj cover crew, at axis-radius. saw the ad for it in the new times, and they included a write up to comment on how cool this daft punk replica was, and that they featured a space ship stage, daft punk-style helmets, laser lights, and used all the same touch equipment that the real punks use. with only a $5 dollar cover. sounded cool to me, so a few friends and i headed out to scottsdale for an unforgettable night of douchbagery.\n\nupon arrival at axis radius, we found no parking and had to valet for $7. we got in line and were told there was a $10 cover. i told the door guy that the new times said it was $5, and he told me to show him. i was taken back, and joked to him as to why the hell i would carry a new times around with me to the bar. refusing to pay $10 to get in, we walked out of line and approached some important-looking security management people who let us in for $5. we got inside, at around midnight, figuring we were gonna be right on time to see faux punk start. they were nowhere in sight. both dj's downstairs were not playing daft punk, and i saw no spaceship stage. \n\ni asked AT LEAST 5 security guards (there are like 50 of them in here to ensure no one gets their ed hardy shirts ripped off or their veneers knocked out) and bartenders and no one seemed to know who the fuck i was talking about, nor knew of the event really. if your club is hosting an event that you've been promoting all across the valley, don't you think you'd school your employees on what was going on? how did no one in that whole fuckin place have no clue what i was talking about?\n\nwe finally got ahold of a bottle girl walking around who told us that the faux punk DJs were UPSTAIRS performing, which was the VIP area. what. the. fuck. they finally came downstairs to perform about 20 minutes later, minus the spaceship stage and cool daft punk replica instruments. and their helmets were motorcycle helmets covered in duck tape.\n\ndrinks were way overpriced, two vodka drinks came out to $23. plus a $1 credit card usage charge. \n\ni was afraid to leave my girlfriends side for fear one of the 10,000 single guys in the room would verbally rape her.\n\ni don't know whose fault this whole mess was, but i'm going to blame all of the sources. axis radius for their lack of communication. the promotions company for being hella unclear. and the new times for dragging me to the epicenter of sausage fest 3000."
0,"Not good. Ordered a spicy tuna roll; mostly rice, and cucumber. Quality was not good, sashimi was plain and presentation was terrible. I pulled up at noon, not one car in the lot, I was the only customer...."
2,the pizza is pretty average. not as bad as Hut/John's/Domino's but not quality NY-style pizza. doughy. light on sauce. cheap food-service toppings.\n\nwings were also average.\n\nSlices are really small and not cheap. $9 for 5 wings and a tiny slice.\n\nthe rave reviews say more about the state of pizza in AZ than about this place.
4,"I had a wonderful time looking around! There are so many things there that catch my fancy, its almost dangerous to go there;)"
2,"Had to go here for a simple pre-job drug test on a Friday afternoon.  Lobby had about 6-8 people in it, but I think some were waiting on others that had already gone into the back.\n\nSigned in and a few minutes after that I was called up to fill out basic paperwork and get my ID copied.  Went back to sit down and looked around.  The lobby itself is nice and looks like it has been recently remodeled, so that was pleasant (even though there were crumbs all around the floor near me... not sure what that was about).  Once you go into the back, it was immaculate - as any hospital should be.\n\nPeople there for injuries or follow-ups did not seemed thrilled at all, and the prices on their board by the desk seemed kind of high, but it IS an urgent care that is located fairly close to the Strip.  I just minded my own business and tried desperately to ignore the guy loudly popping his gum a few chairs down. (RAGE)\n\nTook about 45 minutes just to pee in a cup.  Not spectacular, but again -- Concentra -Urgent- Care.  Is it urgent for me to pee in a cup or is it urgent to fix the guy who almost sliced his finger off?  =P  I may not like waiting, but I definitely understand.\n\nThe staff was actually nice compared to previous Concentra experiences.  Oh, also took note that at least one of the staff members spoke Spanish.  Slow time plus non-emergency situation equals decent experience.  Sounds good to me!"
3,Love this locally owned pet store.  You can find just about everything you need. I started shopping there because they carried my Taste of the Wild brand dog food.  And they were super close to my new house.  \n\nThe store is always really clean and the employees are super friendly - even offering to carry out my heavy bag of dog food for me!
0,"I came with every intent of purchasing a wallet from Kate Spade and then a pair of flats or bag that suited me. \n\nA sales associate gave me a very lukewarm welcome. I don't expect to be greeted with flutes of champagne at all but it really felt lackluster and didn't set a good tone for my experience. I knew which wallet I was looking for and proceeded to try and find it. The sales associates left me alone which I appreciated because I like to get my shopping on  and ask for help when I need it. Other people might have preferred to be approached at least, seeing as there were three employees and only one of them was occupied with a customer who left very shortly after I arrived.\n\nI crossed the store a few times and couldn't find what I was looking for so I asked one of the ladies if she had what I was looking for. Without double checking or asking me to show her the wallet I was looking for, she immediately told me, \""No, we don't have that wallet here. It's new so we don't have it in stores yet. It's not even available.\"" Props to the woman for knowing her stuff, unfortunately the wallet had been available since the fall. I first found it on Nordstrom.com. Maybe it was my mistake believing a store would carry it's own products or that an employee at a Kate Spade flagship store would be more knowledgeable about their products than I would be. In that moment I decided I wouldn't bother with a pair of flats and/or a purse figuring the sales associate wouldn't be very helpful anyways. I booked it to Nordstrom and found exactly what I was looking for and even got 25% off my purchase (wallet wasn't on sale). \n\nI wouldn't rate the customer service here as uppity, just poor."
3,"Great hookah bar. It had middle eastern tapestry on the walls, middle eastern music playing, and comfortable seating to lounge in.\n\nCafe Gitana was great in their service. The staff checked up on us and promptly brought out our beer and wine. \n\nWe had gone to another hookah bar the night before, which despite their cheap prices, we weren't a fan. At Cafe Gitana, it costs about $14 for a shisha with two coals. That could last you a good while. We stayed for about an hour and we barely finished one coal.\n\nWish we came here the first night in Montreal. Great place."
2,"It's fine. \n\nI miss the Yoshi's of old, though. They used to make the sushi rolls as you ordered them. The Yoshi Roll was the best!! They still make them, but they are never available (and they are called Chicken rolls now). I asked why and they only make 2 orders worth in the morning and they go fast.  That to me says MAKE MORE ROLLS."
2,We tried the sandwiches and crepes they been good but didn't exited us like the tiny shop we found on a road trip to Annapolis ...  also the opening times are not as great.
4,"This place rocks! My pups, Martin, had so much fun here. As soon as we got to the car he was OUT! The water is great for them, I imagine that those dogs who got sick here weren't fully immunized. You should check with your vet before taking your dog to any dog park. But, seriously, this place is great, if you dog even kinda likes water, he will love this park."
0,"Ok, seriously @Starbucks, there should not be visible evidence on the toilet seat that the prior user was... um.... having a bad day.\n\nGross.\n\nNo other comments. That's just unacceptable.\n\nBTW: after being there at least 90 minutes, I used the restroom again just prior to leaving, and there had been zero cleaning done.\n\nNEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!"
1,"After  reading the Yelp reviews, I went to Diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a \""snack\"". They had a surprisingly sophisticated drink menu so I ordered a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut vodka and topped with pickled vegetables.  As I am watching the bartender make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest vodka in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over it which had a terrible color!  I love a good bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno - cheap vodka, crappy mix and no pickled vegetables.  On to the food - I ordered wings and fried pickles.  The fried pickles were good - the wings were not.  They were chewy, not spicy and dry.  Fast forward 3 hour and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the bathroom for a good 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.  If you're looking for good, cheap, greasy food try Pinky's!"
3,"honestly people... i go out a lot. I am a party girl and do clubs like every other night. LAX is old, its not the greatest, the crowd sucks butt on most nights. \nBUT: I have NEVER had a bad time there. I just love to dance away and people let youjust dance. Of course a lot of shorty glassywearing guys hit on you if you are a semi hot girl, but... its still fun. The security are all over, they call semi hot girls to not so hot guys tables for entertainment, hey its free booze! \nIts an ok club, very euro trashy but it always has given me fun nights of just dancing the fat away."
3,"I really enjoyed our stay at Manoir Ambrose. Great location, free Wi-Fi, comfortable beds, warm rooms, great complimentary breakfast with outstanding coffee, nice TVs, excellent rates, etc."
2,"This airport is the perfect port to put you in the mood for your Vegas trip.  Shortly after getting off your plane you are bombarded by the sound of slot machines and a variety of shops.  Take note -- if you forget to buy souvenirs at the hotel, you can always find a few neat things from the actual strip hotels here.\n\nThere's the escalator that takes you to Baggage claim with the large \""Welcome to Vegas\"" sign to put you in the mood.  Baggage Claim, however, is consistently SLOOOOOW.  The cab stand is hit or miss depending on when you come.  I've stood in line anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes.  So each time I always wonder whether I should just fork out some bucks for a car service (prearranged as onsite limos/cars are discouraged as unsafe).\n\nThis place gets three stars because aside from the slow baggage claim and unpredictable cab stands, the airport is compact and efficient, which means I never really worry about having to catch my flight."
4,I wanted to say how happy I am that I contacted Dolcinea! I have had lashes put on since last November at Cherry Lash Lounge (over-priced) and left after many attempts disappointed. I wasn't happy with the fullness of my lashes.\nI called Dolcinea at Humble Bee to see what could be done. She did an amazing job! They are so much FULLER and feel lighter. I have so many more lashes and got compliments from someone immediately after leaving Sola Salon! Love my lashes now! Prices are very reasonable! Check her out - she is worth it.\nShe is awesome!!
0,"I don't go into IHOP looking for a Tour de force for the tastebuds, clean bathrooms, or even a coffee cup without any lipstick stains on it. But, service should bad in the very least. Not sure how the service is because no one served us. One star because they have a roof and tables. We got up and left after waiting for 10 minutes to receive our drinks. It was not busy."
4,"I am a patient here at Clear Cosmetic and couldn't be any happier. At a young age I had always had a problem with excessive hair growth on my legs so I had been interested in Laser since I had heard about it. I was highly recommended this Med Spa which i wont name. I had a terrible experience, I was burnt and broke out with a rash and to top it off I had noticed little change. She promised that if I kept coming I would see the change but it was to expensive to take a risk again. AI waited a couple years and decided to try again. I met Shannon who was extremely helpful and nice and explained the process in depth. Needles to say I was a bit skeptical but after the first session I noticed immediate results. I had no breakouts and couldn't be happier with the results. Especially with the affordable prices that they offer! This is my 3rd treatment and I'm loving the results more and more each time! :)"
2,"It breaks my heart to give this place fewer than five stars. I mean, hey, they have cupcakes. Glorious cupcakes. And fro-yo...typically I'd be in heaven, but from my last experience three stars is a stretch for Divine Cupcakes. \n\nThis place is adorable...nestled Dilworth, facing East Blvd. The shop itself is cute-ly appointed with gigantor cupcakes smiling on the walls and a fro yo topping bar in the middle. But let's get down to brass tacks...the cupcakes. \n\nI stopped in around 6 pm on a Friday, hoping to score some cupcakes for the weekend (ok, it was for me for that night, whatever). When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly employee who directed me to the cupcake case. There were only seven cupcakes there. Yes, seven total, not seven varieties. Seven cupcakes, three varieties. \n\nThe kind employee mentioned that they were getting another batch of cupcakes around 6:30 pm...but unfortunately I didn't have 30 minutes to wait for a cupcake. So I chose a carrot cake cupcake and an Italian creme cupcake. Both were on the average (to smaller) size. So, I walked out of there with two smallish cupcakes and $6+ fewer in my pocket. I was reaaallly hoping they would be super fantastic. \n\nNot so much. The carrot cake was moist and well made but I expected more creme cheese in the frosting. 3.5/5 for this one. But the cupcake I was really jacked about, the Italian creme, was super dry and crumbly...not to mention very small. The taste of the cupcake was lovely...but the texture totally ruined it for me. Maybe I just got the runt of the cupcake litter but I was disappointed. Crumbly, dry cupcake = Sad Nicole.\n\nWill I be back? Sure...you can't keep me away from trying the fro yo or a few more cupcake varieties. But for $3 per cupcake I won't be back too often."
1,"We did my aunts birthday dinner, considering it being 5 star restaurant, their service was crappy. My aunt turned 90, you know it's a big one, we made a reservation and asked for the special cake(of course we verified the price and everything) they couldn't find a damn cake for a while. I saw a hostess writing it down, \""party of 10 with chocolate bday cake\"" when we got there, she asked us back, \""oh did it write it down? Oh we are sorry, we can't find it right now\"" what the hell. It was frustrating, they could find the cake for a while. And then the waiter spilt water on my uncle. To top it off, there's no garnish or anything on your food, if you order piece of meat, that's all you are gonna get. And my aunt, she loves lamb, that's why we picked here and we confirmed before that they had lamb, but on her birthday, when we got there, they said there was no lamb that day, it's seasonal item. Again, it's her 90th birthday, how often does that come? That was the whole point, lamb and the cake for her. They really need to do something about their service. We spent more than a grand in there, and they almost ruined my aunts birthday. God what a disaster."
4,We went here for dinner tonight and we were absolutely amazed at our entire experience. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff is all very friendly. \n\nWe started out with the crab fondue and house oysters on the half shell. The crab fondue was phenomenal. It was full of huge chunks of crab meat and yummy cheese. The chips were good too and extra crispy. I was surprised at how meaty and high quality the house oysters were especially for $1 each. The cocktail sauce was perfect with just the right amount of horseradish.\n\nEntrees were the lobster roll with grilled asparagus and the shrimp and grits. The lobster roll was great! They gave a generous amount of lobster. The bread was garlic bread baked and then turned inside out. The asparagus had a great grilled smoky taste. The shrimp and grits had really awesome flavor to it. \n\nWe loved everything so we decided we had to get dessert even though we were painfully stuffed. We got the blackberry cobbler topped with ice cream. It was absolutely delicious!! Lindsey gave phenomenal service. We plan to come back again next week!
2,"Visited Bomberos last Friday with another couple.  We had 2-3 glasses of wine each and 3 appetizers (cheese place, salad, and meat plate).  The tab was $180 and we all felt it was overpriced.  The wines were nice bur not wow and the food was OK.  I'd travel to Postino next time for much better food, larger variety of vino and better value.\n\nAs for ambience, the inside is very noisy, it was difficult to carry on a conversation at times.\n\nThe patio does look nice so we might try it again when the weather is cooler but then again, maybe not."
4,"I went to Vegas back in April but forgot to write a review for this place.  I was overwhelmed by places to review in April. :)\n\nThis place is amazing.  My group of friends went to Fremont to do the whole downtown experience away from the strip on a Saturday night.  We typically leave 1 night per trip to come to Fremont for the completely different experience you get there as opposed to the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nWe were actually trying to find the new SlotZilla Zipline (that was unfortunately still under construction) when we wandered south a bit from the Fremont Street experience.  Boy I am glad we decided to do that because we found this little treasure.  Keep in mind it was about midnight when we wandered across this place so I am sure it is a difference experience during the day.  When we got there, it was not very busy and they carded us at the gate.  I guess it becomes 21+ only after 9pm which is awesome.\n\nThe middle area was a playground type of thing which I'm sure kids use during the day, and then drunk adults use at night.  The stand out in this area was a light up game that made you push lights as they come on while your opponent tried to do the same.  This led to hysterical fun (especially after drinking a few) and burned quite a few calories in the process.\n\nThere were also restaurants and stores around on multiple levels but the majority were closed.  It was Midnight after all so I cant fault them.  The Jerky place in there was amazing....I ended up buying like 10 bags because it was so good.  I would like to come earlier to see more of the stores and places.\n\nDid I mention that the whole place was made out of shipping containers by the way?\n\nWay cool!"
4,TASTY DOGS!!!!!! One of the best hot dogs I have ever had!! It's a mom and pop own food stand. But well designed and friendly service. The price isn't to bad just make sure to bring cash though. But the way Brad and Kat make their gourmet hot dogs makes them stand out from the rest of those hot dog restaurants. Now if everyone can just convince them to open a store up and have more hours that would be AWESOME!!!
0,For the price they add way too much rice to your sushi with little fish. Staff is so wonderful though. But doesn't make up for the food. I regret going here with my family.
4,"A hidden gem hidden inside Restaurant Charlie. \n\nAfter eating here twice, and dining at many other strong contenders, I believe I can legitimately say this is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Well executed, challenging dishes made to order right infront of you at the bar. \n\nKaiseki cuisine is on tap here, featuring a heavy dose of seafood. Kaiseki features nature in food, and many dishes will tell a story. Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of consuming (first with my eyes, then with my stomach) have been \""Cherry Blossoms in Snow\"", \""Life Cycle of the Trout\"" and \""Oysters on the Beach\"" with food recreating each portion of those scenes. Stunning. \n\nChef Nagahara said he hopes anyone who returns the restaurant will not eat the same meal twice, and I can confirm this for although some dishes were similar, nothing was replicated. Chef gets very passionate when he talks about food, explaining how amazing it was to get a still in rigour blue fin tuna from Tsukiji to work with one day, and suggesting we go visit Guy Savoy another. Word has it that Charlie Trotter hand picked him and persuaded him to leave his academic life as a physicist to run Bar Charlie. \n\nThe drinks menu features pre-Prohibition cocktails that are definitely worth a second glance. And prepare to be wowed by Vannessa Garcia's pastry creations for dessert.\n\nIf you enjoy esoteric, thoughtful food prepared by a skilled hand, you should book an evening at Bar Charlie now, and put yourself and Chef Nagahara's hands. Trust."
2,"I've only utilized the UPS drop off here, and nothing else.  Twice I've dropped off stuff, and twice I've gotten my refund, so I think Postalmax of Scottsdale is a-OK!"
2,"Way too overpriced for average mexican food, but great service. \n\nAll of their drinks are super sweet. \n\nI also disliked that the tacos were \""family style\"", aka you're forced to order 4 of the same tacos for $14, so you'll spend another $14 just to try a different kind of tacos. \n\nthe Late night happy hour is for Industry folk only. I was mislead and thought it applied to everyone. \n\nthe only plus was that after i ordered my expensive cocktail that tasted like sugar and hated it, my waitress without skipping a beat offered to take an order for something else. \n\nAm I the only one confused at the term \""family style tapas\""? Tiny portions that you are forced to share and pay exorbitant prices for... no thanks."
4,"wasn't expecting much, we were at Sam Boyd Stadium all day and my friends were in the mood for sushi and we saw this place when we stopped for gas.  it didn't look like much, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall next to StarBucks.  really?  how good could it be?  IT was the best value of sushi I have ever had.  \nwe had a party of 8, ordered the 'all you can eat' for $28 (I think), and the service was quick, friendly and helpful.  the food was great.  we left full.  how often do you actually leave a sushi bar full?  not often for me.  \nI will defineately eat there again when I am back in Vegas!"
3,I love trying any new Pittsburgh restaurant and this was on the top of my list.  We made a reservation about a month in advance knowing they can be hard to get. I recommend you definitely make reservations.  We were seated downstairs and I love the d\u00e9cor of the place-rustic with animal heads on the walls yet trendy. The bar is super cool and it was packed!  They have a nice drink menu and the prices are reasonable. I started off with the  Arsenal Santa Cinnamon-this is delicious but you get 7 oz for $8.  My next drink was the Penn Weizen which was only $4.  Our server was really knowledgably about the specials and menu items. We were served quickly and he checked in on us numerous times. I went with the cauliflower which was delicious and had a sweet/savory taste with carrots and a nice sauce.  I also got the country ham which was ok. I would not get this again. You get 2 small biscuits that don't have much taste with a few pieces of cured ham. The yogurt dipping sauce was good.  Others in my party ordered the mussels. I'm not a fan of seafood but you got a huge portion.  The rice cakes and Brussels sprout dishes were amazing and glad I got to sample them.  The mac and cheese looked delicious as well as the dirty pasty which was very tasty!  Wish we saved room for dessert.  The small plates are enough to eat on your own-probably recommend 2 per person or fun to share!
0,"Boring.  The moment you walk in the restaurant is just so plain.  Sure there are bright colors but nothing stood out.  Boring.  \n\nSo I order my usual pizza sausage and green pepper.  It was ok.  Nothing stood out.  The pizza was ok.  That is it.  I can barely finish this review.  It was not bad, it was not good.  It was just there.  We had a Groupon, so I took a chance.  \n\nIt is pretty far off the road.  A bit annoying to find.  Also annoying?  The loudness.  The tables make you feel like you are eating with your neighbors.  I understand children must eat as well but to allow the amount of noise that was occurring to go unaddressed was unacceptable.  Needless to say, I was SO happy to go.  \n\nThank god for the Groupon because the prices are not worth it.  Please go somewhere else for pizza."
4,Great!!! Service... Beautiful Inimate & classy ambiance.. My 2nd trip there & still the best ribeye steak I have ever had.... I highly recomend !!!
2,"The Macayo's chain is an American version of Mexican food. You won't find anything spicy or authentic on the menu, but the food is still good. Just set the right expectations. They do great lunch specials and a decent happy hour. Two tacos, rice and beans for under 10 bucks. Sure I will. \n\nThe service is great and this particular location has a pleasantly large outdoor patio"
2,"After a private party at Commonwealth, my best friend and I decided to come down to BWW for some grub to soak up the alcohol.  This location is open all night and centrally located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Outlet center.  \n\nDefinitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.  \n\nFor our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.  \n\nFootball season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.  Love the central location and that means a bright future for me and BWW!"
1,"Extremely nice staff!  But not nice enough to make up for the subpar service & mediocre food.  Cats, did I mention freaking stray cats?  As someone allergic cats I was immediately turned off.\n\nOk, let's break down this visit.  Waitress was very nice, a little \""green,\"" but a complete sweetheart who seemed to try her best.  My warm water was never delivered, my daughter's drink was never refilled & she never offered condiments with my daughter's leftovers.  I feel bad for critiquing her because she was so nice but she has more to learn.  On a good note, they prebussed well.\n\nI ordered a chips & salsa tree.  Three out of the four were good but the guacamole/tomatillo salsa was missing something.  I thought there green salsa tasted store bought.  The chips weren't too salty & were nice & crispy.\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty excited to try my shrimp & carne asada.  I'm thinking it's going to be amazing & I'll finally get to try elote.  (I was definitely curious about my husband's shrimp verdes enchiladas)\n\nFood comes & that's about the best thing I can say about it.  I looked at my corn & it was clearly drying out from sitting around a while.  There was a weird stabbed key lime on the plate as well, also dry.  The shrimp, all three of them were eh but cooked appropriately (all 3 of them).  The beans were pretty good but nothing that really stood out to me.  Ok the best letdown was the carne asada.  It was a thick slab of meat not thinner slices, which is more traditional.  I ordered it medium rare & it was delivered slightly overcooked.  I was pleased with the tenderness of the meat but the flavor just tasted burned.  I called it charburned instead of charbroiled.\n\nI asked for tortillas for my carne & she brought me three dried out tortillas that sat wrapped up so long they broke apart as i unrolled them.  I asked for more & they weren't much better.\n\nI tasted one bite of my husband's enchiladas & was disappointed to taste that it was covered with that horrible store bought tasting green salsa.  I did not return for another bite.\n\n\nI had high hopes for this place.  :/\n\nP.S. my tourist friends loved it.  Perhaps they just didn't know better."
0,"Wife's food good. Mine fair. Waitress bad ! Parked in adjacent parking lot , waitress to validate parking ticket, didn't and couldn't leave parking lot. This sucks! Can't even buy ticket ! Had to back and get ticket/ token to leave! Not going back!"
1,"I went to the capital grill for lunch. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar. My buddy and I both ordered the blue cheese burger, he had his well done I had mine medium. The service was quick and attentive. The bar tender when she delivered our burgers got the order mixed up and I took a big bite out of a well done burger. Ugh! Sorry I can't switch burgers and I didn't have time to wait for another. The service personnel at capital grille promote themselves as professional servers, which I understand, but when you do have people who order the same thing cooked entirely the different way You HAVE to make sure you have the right order in each hand. She didn't and failed to confirm this when she placed our orders in front us."
0,"Ordered the Buffet, the food was cold, I told the waiter never got back with me. Upon check out, one of the waitresses asked me how was everything, I told her the food was cold in the buffet, she started making excuses, never said sorry and never offered to not charge for the meal. Poor customer service and frankly hazardous food that is sitting in the buffet for god knows how long."
1,This location has filled three orders for me in their drive through. Unfortunately two of three times the order was incomplete. They also don't ask customers in drive through if they would like condiments. Apparently it is a new company policy that the consumer must ask for them and employees aren't allowed to ask you if you would like them according to the manager I spoke with. This often leads to drive through customers having to go back to the store or go in side after going through the drive through just to get hot sauce if they forget to ask for it. \n\nOrders with only two or three items should be easily filled and easy to complete. Probably will not return due to issues with this.
2,"While the food was good, they seemed very annoyed that we had Groupons.  The server came over and we let her know and she immediately sighed and looked like we just ruined her night.  She said we'd have to speak with her manager about it so she went and got him.  He was pleasant about it and reiterated the exact rules of the Groupon so we would be aware.\n\nThe rest of the night the server seemed bothered by us which started to becoming annoying.  But the food was good, so we'll be heading back, hopefully with a Groupon to see if the server is still as annoyed! haha"
1,"This review is for the Dollar Rent a Car location at the MGM Grand:\n\nWe did a day-long rental from Dollar Rent a Car so that we could drive ourselves out to the Hoover Dam from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.  It was convenient to have the agency right in the main lobby of the hotel; that's the main reason we decided to rent from here.\n\nFirst the good:  Our blue Ford Fusion was clean and well maintained.  It was pretty easy to get to the cars, up on floor 5 of the MGM parking garage.  \n\nNow, the bad:  Both on key pickup and key return, I could not believe that there was only one attendant working the rental desk in the MGM lobby.  It took almost an hour of waiting in line for us to get our keys.  I had to wait for at least 20 minutes upon key return before the employee asked if anyone in line was waiting to simply drop their keys off.\n\nThe experience would have been a lot better if they thought about their staffing needs, especially during the busy weekend times.  I don't know if there are better options elsewhere, but in the future I'd definitely consider just renting from the airport, even if it meant I had to take a cab over there to get the car."
0,"Okay. A) why would you need to buy alcohol in Vegas? Go to the damn casino.\nB) big liquor selection, but not as good as Bevmo. C) Korean favoritism is ridiculous. I mean they sold these kids liquor without even checking ID which is sorta sketchy and seems unsafe. D) Lee has a thick-accent, and is sort of rude when you ask him to locate something for you.\n\nOverall, save your money and drink in the casino (or Bevmo). And tip the paid-to-be friendly/attractive waitresses. Better than dealing with a middle-aged Korean asshole."
1,"Solid cheap drunk food. And when you're having a greasy day, don't want to cook, and want something different. Their gyros are the only thing good."
1,"I came here an hour before they closed and did not feel rushed at all. Overall they have some good choices but for the price bacchanal is a far better choice. \n\nI loved the Bone Marrow, Waldorf Salad, Panna Cotta, & Watermelon. It was disappointing that they didn't have king crab legs..just snow crab. Everything else served was nothing to rave about. \n\nThey have a good variety of desserts and I definitely recommend trying the Gelato. They have a large variety with some unique flavors. When I went there was a line to get the gelato. Some of the flavors are really good (Chai Tea, Nutella) but others taste off (Mint Chip). The macarons were stale...the filling was hard\n\nWhile dining there was a table nearby that was called to the managers attention. The server paid extra attention to them, often flirting with the group of guys and basically neglected our table. Every single time she came to pick up our plates we had already stacked them for her because she had taken so long that we'd gone multiple rounds around the buffet. \n\nBe aware that there are better buffets on the strip and think about whether or not you want to spend your money here."
3,"For some reason, I have always liked the MGM.    Maybe it's because it's close to the Airport or maybe because it's close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.  It's a large, very large hotel typical of what you'd see on the strip.   The hotel itself is really nice.   The rooms are big enough and the bathrooms are pretty large for what you need.   There are plenty of places to eat and gamble.  If you are a wandering soul, the MGM is a good place to start your hike up the strip.   \nWill I be back?  You bet I will!"
2,"Les Enfants Terribles at its core is a great restaurant. The menu is nicely varied, the food is delicious...when it arrives at a reasonable time and in the correct order. I've had great and mediocre experiences here, mostly around the services unfortunately. Its either the food arrives way too late, the order is wrong or the waiter/waitress is so-so on the professional side. That being said when it works, it works very well. Worth a shot, especially in summer with that fantastic view and great terrace."
4,"I got the farm burger ($15)- comes with egg, duck breast bacon, and cheddar. The bun was toasty and delicious, the meat was PERFECT, the egg was soft but not runny, and I've never had duck before but it was salty and way above regular bacon. I'm no culinary expert but all I can say was that it was delicious. Actually, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my entire life. Gordon Ramsay really knows what he's doing! The fries were legit fries- really thick cut, not oily, and so hot and fresh that we had to wait to eat them! The ketchup is really unique, I've never tried anything like it. Highly recommended if you're in Las Vegas!"
2,"When you are hungry and want something different, Taco Bell is a great place to go.  The Cool Ranch Taco's are o.k., and the staff member at the register was very helpfull and polite.  He also had a great character and made placing our order and wait pleasent."
4,"I have an old lab. He is the type of dog that gives you the look, and he magically suckers you into giving him treats. Dr. K, my vet, politely warned me about the consequences of having an overweight dog, so I started allowing my dog to exercise more. The treats stopped, yet the weight stayed.  That last sentence will probably hit a nerve with some women, but I am still talking about my dog. Well, he was put on diet with food that is certified to make him lose weight, medications, and wealth of information for his owners. Dr. K gave us a compassionate lecture how we are not doing our dog any favor. That he is old, and we should give him the dignity to live his last years of his life as pain free as possible. He's excessive weight was simply killing him. What I remember the most about her lecture was how much love, knowledge and respect she has in every word that she said. I have been to other vets and I have never received such service. Dr. K, I applaud you as a vet and  praise you as a human being."
0,Service was awful. I tried Tuesday special Pastie; it was horrible and way overpriced. Not a true northern Michigan pastie. Very small portion with roast beef and celery which are not ingredients in a traditional pastie.\n\nSkip this place for lunch .
3,"I often come here to socialize with my husband and his coworkers in the evenings; this seems to be the place of choice for work gatherings and going away parties. The restaurant is clean, the bar is huge, and I am eternally shocked at how one waitress can handle the 30+ obnoxious humans that gather in one corner in our party at any given time. :) The beers are very reasonably priced and I love that they have ciders on tap. My favorite food item is the flatbread pizza; it's HUGE, filling, cheap and delicious. The neat thing about this place are all of the little areas that can be sectioned off for group gatherings; I love that while the space is very open, you can still find a quiet corner for your party to have a good time. The wait for food and service can be lengthy at times, but I've always been completely satisfied. I love having a casual, comfortable place near my house to chill on weeknights."
0,"What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!"
4,"Have only been to Presto one time, but wow... it was great!  We frequent Vegas at lot, and it is so nice to find a place off the Strip.  Not to mention it is affordable and healthy.  The day that we went there, they were quite busy, yet the workers were still highly attentive to us and came to our table several times.  \n\nLastly, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito Special.  I currently live in Los Angeles, the land of the breakfast burrito.  It was still, easily, the best breakfast burrito I had ever had!"
4,"Yes, this is a sandwich shop that I'll be back to time and time again.  The Yelpers are right, it's completely overwhelming.  But have no fear, a trusty Which Wich employee will see your bewildered look and come to your rescue.  \n\nI read the reviews, and braced myself before I entered the sandwich emporium.  I'm sure that you could see the whites all the way around my eyes when I looked at the menu and selection of bags.  The girl behind the counter came over to me, welcomed me and then talked me through ordering exactly what I wanted.  She said that the Italian grinder is the most popular, and for good reason.  So that's what I got.  \n\nI liked the different options and sizes that separates this place from Subway.  It is a little more expensive - but if you're careful, you can get away with a great deal.  The ingredients were fresh and delicious.  I had avocado added to mine, and that was my best decision all day.  It was that beautiful light green, and piled throughout my sandwich!  This is an excellent choice for a lunch stop.  Like subway on steroids (but with brownies and Rice Krispies instead of cookies)."
1,"After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \n\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future."
0,"Not worthy of a near perfect rating, that's for sure.\n\nHad the lumberjack. It was okay, nothing to write home about, needed extra flavor and spice. Very bland.\n\nTook twenty minutes to get our food. Seemed like a long time since you order and pay and then sit down and wait.\n\nLastly....Price! Holy crap!"
3,"Holy crap.  Nicest Yoshi's that I've ever frequented.  \n\nModern decor and easily accessible from Maryland Parkway.  Right across the street from UNLV --- lucky bastards.  \n\nAtmosphere was great, but the Bowl itself was OK.  Rice was a bit dry --- not as moist as other Yoshi's.  But I'll take it.  Cheap, sweet beef.  I can't complain.  \n\nShowed up on a Thursday at 11:30 a.m.  Not crowded at all."
1,"We went there for lunch. We were there 10 minutes and our car was towed. We were visiting from out of town. The place was empty, it would have been nice is the waitress altered us about the parking. What kind of restaurant doesn't have parking out back? They called us a cab and packed our food to go. The food was o.k."
4,Great food. Great service. The cubano is awesome
4,"Such a great surprise to find this so close to home! The salon is beautiful and calm. No noisy television. The massage chairs are amazing. I had the coco pedicure and besides the lotion massage and buffing, the hot stone massage was amazing. The staff is very courteous and professional. My new place."
1,"I love chicken fingers more than I love some members of my family. So when Living Social had a coupon for a place that had chicken fingers and beignets I was elated. I dragged the boyfriend across town to try this place out. It's in a strip mall and is a very small place. Never one to be detoured by decor or location I ventured in and got their namesakes (some chicken fingers and beignets). The chicken was disappointing. Not as much batter as I prefer and seasoned pretty heavily with pepper and spices. The best part of the chicken fingers was the dipping sauce I chose, jalapeno ranch, but it added a kick that I was already getting from the batter seasoning. The fries were delicious, but it's pretty hard not to make great fries. Now on to the beignets. They were still a bit oily so I wish they were dried off a bit longer before adding the powdered sugar. Again I was unimpressed, but the boyfriend LOVED them. He even ordered more to take with him. The one thing that was consistently good about the food was that it all came out hot. Something I really appreciate after eating lukewarm dorm food for too many years. Hot doesn't overcome food that really just isn't that tasty. If they changed their batter I would be back in a flash. I recommend trying it out if you're looking for a different kind of chicken finger (not at all like Raisin Canes, Popeyes, etc..) or if you are in the area and looking for something sweet to eat."
3,Great place! The interior is really causy and nice looking. It's the sort of place where you could spend hours talking and not noticing it. The staff is really nice and you can also go there to eat. You have a good selection of alcohols.
3,"Even though I have never been to their actual mill at Queen Creek, I do love their olive oils and will purchase them whenever I see them at a farmers market or gourmet store. It was really cool to see that they have this store in UNION that has their full line of products. At least I think so. They had A LOT of stuff, anyway. I bought some of the spicy olives that they had available to sample since they were just so yummy and also after trying a handful of the dozen or so oils they had out to try ended up selecting the bacon and white truffle flavors to take home with me. YUM! I have already broken open the bacon olive oil to drizzle on some butternut squash ravioli I got at Sprouts and it was D-LISH!"
4,"It was really 4 and I gave it 5 to balance out the 3's.\nOur server, Carol, was excellent! She's beyond GREAT!\nTry the man candy and the self-serve wall of beer!\nThe chocolate stout is excellent!"
0,I'm going to try hard and not be too brutal. Eek or should just say Meow!\n\nUsually come here to pick up some 20 pound bags of Nyjer Thistle Seed for my favorite Goldfinches. They live in my super old and very tall trees that we have both in the front and back yard.\n\nAlways have a difficult time at this location. The inventory is rarely in the same place and they are usually out of the only thing we want. Wow!\n\nService is friendly once you find someone. Then it just gets frustratingly worse from there. Almost feels like we are talking Pig Latin or something.\n\nToday they tell me that the 20 pound bag is no longer an option and we would need to buy several 8 pound bags instead. Just for the record the smaller bags are much more expensive per pound and not something I care to entertain.\n\nDid I mention the person who was emptying a deadly smelling cat box in the trash can by the front door. Even though this is an outside trash can ... IT STINKS!\n\n1.5 STARS
1,"I have had this place bookmarked for a few months and we decided to do takeout last night.  I had high hopes based on a majority of reviews but was so disappointed.\n\nWe ordered;\n the White Pizza ( mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic).  It looked very appetizing but to me it had no distinctive flavor and seemed bland.  The crust was nice.\n\nFresh Tomato, Basil and Garlic  Pizza  (Fresh sliced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh garlic and basil, topped with parmesan cheese).  Once again, the presentation was great but it was also on the bland side.  The crust was good.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana Dinner- (Layered eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce).  It also came with a generous portion  of Fettuccine Alfredo (although there were other choices) and hot Italian bread.  The alfredo sauce had a weird (not bad-just weird) aroma but it was tasty.  \n\nMy husband liked the alfredo & Eggplant Parm much better then the pizza. He thought the pizza was good but nowhere near Amore's (his fave). \n\nThere is too many other places to get pizza and Italian food in our area so I doubt we would return but I think the potential is there.  Maybe it was just an off night."
2,"Before Greek Isles, I don't think I'd ever been to a completely Greek restaurant before, so I was looking forward to experimenting.  We entered and thought the inside decor was kind of cheesy.  It felt like a throwback to my 90s apartment decor with the columns, Greek statues, etc.  Granted, I don't know what I was expecting being that it was a Greek restaurant, but it just felt weird.  We chose to sit outside because it was a decent night.   \n\nWe started with a combo appetizer.  Everything was pretty good and the combo contained things I had sampled before at festivals, except for the grape leaves.  Ick.  They were bitter, even stuffed.  At least I know I don't like them now.  The chicken entree was pretty good, but the service wasn't great and we waited a lot.  I think our server forgot about us, being outside and all.  Lastly, I couldn't go home without some baklava for dessert, so I enjoyed that to the very last crumb (you can hardly go wrong with baklava).  \n\nI'll probably give Greek Isles another chance at another time, but I can't say that my first experience really stood out and made me shout with glee, \""Hey, let's go back!\"""
3,"Before pop culture coined the term tween; but only by about a year or two, I had the privilege of playing ice hockey as a young teen. I had a few 'wordy' on ice debates over this or that during a peewee season. \""I think you'll like they way I use 'Pow!', 'Bam!', and 'Zap!' in a sentence.\"" I 'politely' explained to the defense-man, alas, I was cordially invited to take a 'break' from the sport I so loved. Time marches on, or so the song goes, and fifteen years later I still hadn't picked it back up.\n\nShazam! I got this wonder-brained idea about a year ago, I'm going to play ice hockey again! \n\nFifteen years later, the call to get back on the ice was overwhelming, I felt like Uncle Sam himself was calling me to serve my country, do my duty, stand up and take action! I spent a few months debating weather I would do it or not and decided to take the plunge.\n\nBeing the frugal person I am, I chose to pay the entire season instead of game by game. You'll spend closer to $20 per league game, instead of $25 by paying it upfront. I picked up a few new pieces of necessary gear I didn't already own, a helmet, gloves, athletic protector (those boys are sensitive you know) ;-), and away I went. \n\nSuiting up that first time, brought back that feeling of sporting camaraderie you can't find anywhere, at least outside of a locker room. Taped the hockey stick, laced up the skates, pulled on the jersey, buttoned up the helmet, and away I went. The puck dropped for my first rotation on the ice, I skated my heart out, and holy cr*p! What the heck was I thinking! OMG, I think I'm about to die, right here, on the ice.\n\nI looked up at the clock, and it was only about 67 seconds into the game, go figure. My next thought was \""I knew I shouldn't have paid the 'entire' season. Now I have to come back :-/ \""\n\nFast forward nine months, I'm still going back week after week. I can finally make it back to the car after a game without limping the entire way there, and no longer feel like I'm punishing myself for the future possibility of keeping up in Adult League Ice Hockey.\n\nI've been told by a number of skaters that while Arcadia doesn't have the best facility, they've got one of the better patches of ice in the valley. Lucky for me, I live only a few miles from here, short commute!\n\nCheck them out for a free skate, drop in for an open hockey, or join me for C-League. There's always a beginner class happening on the weekend for anyone interested, they'll even loan you out some gear if you'd like to 'try before you buy' so to speak.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, see you on the ice!"
0,"Our salads had \""rust\"" on them so you know the \""bag o salad\"" was old.  One person out of 8 ordered a taco salad in a shell, they bring it they don't have shells, even after we asked.\nBrisket is NOT brisket it was pot roast and was sooooooooooooo dry and you could tell that the food was not fresh that day because you couldn't tell the potatos were potatos because they were so brown from sitting in the pot.\n\nWe were all so disappointed with the entire meal including the baby back ribs."
1,"As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.\n\nI had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK. \n\nTo top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good. \n\nI would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road."
4,"What a fun store!  I was searching online for baby boutiques in the Phoenix area and found Frances Vintage.    Due to the light rail construction it was a little hard to get to, but well worth it! (Park in the back, off of Central- as that is where the entrance is).\n\nGeorganne's (who BTW is very friendly!) shop is the real deal.  Real vintage items and items that reflect the vintage touch.  She has a great selection of whimsical vintage kitchen items (some of my favorite things!).  The baby section is full of really sweet designer items (onsies, bibs, blankets, t-shirts and a few really neat jackets!) and fantastic wooden toys.  In the back is the real treat- a large selection of vintage dresses.  \n\nNot only will I be back, I will be bringing friends.  Frances Vintage is the perfect gift store, I know I'll be doing some holiday shopping here in a few months."
2,"I called in a pasta order ahead.  I tried two dishes.  The chicken parm and one other dish.  The sauces were tasty but a bit on the salty side as the other reviews have mentioned.  AND I LOVE SALT!!\n\nI don't know what it was but the staff (owner and cook) were both very nice but for some reason I felt awkward in that place like I was an unexpected guest.  Then again, I'm a younger, sharper dressed, fine watch, imported car kind of American boy and this strip mall isn't in the part of town that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.. It wasn't enough to turn me off but I did feel weird being in there.\n\nThe food was good overall with the exception of being really salty.  At least it isn't bland and has flavor.  \n\nI will surely give them another shot and try the pizza..."
1,"The entire time I was there I kept thinking, \""man I cannot wait to review this place\"".\n\nOkay, let me set the stage. I was walking on my lunch hour and happened to notice a new restaurant in place of the old Chinese buffet place (that was not good) on Liberty. The sign read, \""$7.99 lunch buffet\"". I thought why not try something new?\n\nI could tell the did some general cleaning up of the building from it's previous tenants. I don't remember the hardwood being so nice or that the flooring was hardwood at all. It was simply decorated, but still decorated. Was it the best? No, but it worked.\n\nAt this moment it's only a buffet. Now here is where my issues with this place begin. This is not an Asian fusion restaurant. It's an Indian buffet with a few Chinese items mixed in. If I would have known that after I got in and sat down I probably would have left. I even Googled the word fusion to make sure I understood the meaning. I get that fusion means to blend (specifically cultures in this sense), but if it's Indian food you're slinging then just call it that.\n\nThe food I did try was decent. It bothered me that the food wasn't the hottest. There was decent size selection to choose from. I will say their chicken salad was amazing. I never eat anything mayonnaise based at buffets so you know I was struggling for food. Even the Chinese items had an Indian kick to them. This may be for you, but it definitely wasn't for me.\n\nThe servers were pleasant and the one waitress seemed very helpful to people who were obviously confused as to what they encountered. I didn't like how they don't give you a bill, but rather, you just walk to the front and pay. Seems kind of like poor business planning to me. I understand at this point you're only selling one food item, but how do you know what I had to drink? I think for the price it's worth it if that's what you're looking for, but I think this is a once is enough place for me."
1,"Ok. Last Update. Cuz I'm never going back.\n\nDear South Point,\n\nWhen a customer gets out of her car and pops a beer at the valet before walking to the registration desk, you should NOT put her on a floor with a broken ice maker. Stupid.\nWhen a customer books a King non-smoking 5 weeks before Super Bowl and you fuck up and give it to someone else, leaving her with 2 Queens, you should TELL her before she walks the Three Vegas Miles she has to walk to get to her room. While lugging her Ice Chest. That Needs Ice. That You Don't Have On Her Floor. Stupid.\nYou should remove the Queen size rocks and replace them with actual mattresses. And WHO DOESN'T TUCK IN THE BOTTOM SHEET !?!??!?! Seriously!?! Stupid.\nPlaying Lucy and Ricky for the weekend kinda worked out, though. We both tossed and turned so much all night that we probably would have fought if we had been in reach.\nYou should schedule more than 2 waitresses for the SportBook and adjoining lounge on Super Bowl Sunday. They were so dog-tired, they didn't even care that we brought in our own bottles of booze. They were happy not to deal with us. Stupid.\n\nAnd your Slots still suck ass out loud.\n\nLastly, Hubby still likes his oysters. I had the crab sandwich. You are very lucky that I wasn't very hungry and didn't take a big old He-Man Starvin'-Marvin bite outta that thing. I'd probably just be getting out of emergency surgery. Hire someone that can tell the difference between crabmeat and crabshell. I can forgive a little piece or two. But these were humongous and I stopped counting and eating at 10 pieces. And you wouldn't take it back or not charge me. Stupid.\n\nOne star for the giant piece of banana cake from the Deli that lasted me all weekend. And the delicious chicken philly cheese sammy with crispy fries.\n\nThe rest of the STUPID building can burn down for all I care."
2,"Nice breakfast, just ok dinner.  Partly my fault for ordering salad with easy on the dressing.  But the lettuce was ice cold and not crisp.  The reason for keeping lettuce ice cold is to crisp it after a wash.\nBut the one thing to really point out is please dont ask us to voice our room number and name.  Take a cue from the front desk clerks, who point to your room number and they talk a little softer.  On the surface, the wait staff are being personable and friendly, but then act a little offended when my sweetheart (with a hotel security background) asks to write it down instead of announce it to the room.  Maybe no one is listening, but he's barring on the safe side."
2,"I've had a few good experiences here, getting my mountain bikes serviced. However, last time I was in there. the service went from professional to amateur. I simply wanted my old pedals and odometer swapped off my old bike to a new one. The young kid helping me kept telling me they were slammed with weekend work tickets. No problem, I was planning on leaving the bikes at the store. This was Tuesday a.m., wanted the bike back end of day Weds. He kept telling me there was no way they could promise that. Fine, but this was a only 20 min job. I don't fault the young kid, he was just doing what he was told. It was his boss/manager, working on the computer, who seemed thoroughly annoyed with every question the kid would throw his way about my needs. Not once did he seem interested in helping me, nor did he even take a moment to turn around to greet me and behave like a manager or professional should. \n\nI left and took the bikes up to Bike Masters at San Tan mall. Scott told me he would be happy to do it right now. They also had bikes they were currently working on, but he went out of his way to take care of me in less than 20 mins. I expected to leave the bikes and pick them up later. This was above and beyond."
0,"I made an account just to review this Starbucks inside Albertsons--that's how bad their service was. I asked for two very simple drinks, a black sweetened ice tea with and without lemonade, and I never tasted a disgusting Starbucks drink until now.  I will definitely be driving an extra 2 miles to get quality Starbucks at Anthem."
2,"I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.\n\nOver a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.\n\nWe entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.\n\nI went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.\n\nI didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream \""can you PLEASE turn that down?!\"" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.\n\nAnyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.\n\nSo i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6\"" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!\n\nThe cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.\n\nI sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.\n\nChoosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.\n\nWhen we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done."
0,"Located in an ugly, dumpy-looking building,in an ugly area of the city, this place boasts lots of \""exclusives\"".  What it really boasts of is cheap-looking, made in China, street/club wear,with HIGH prices. Their top floor has been shut down for now, the outlet permanently closed, and their once impressive toiletries/perfume lines,gone the way of the dodo. They carry the famous English Molton Brown line, but the selection is sooo paltry, what's the point? The small caf\u00e9 at the entrance wafts its onion/ tuna/vinegar aroma throughout the store. Elegant! MEH!"
0,"Service was bad even for a bro bar. \nFound this place while looking for food shortly after the Super Bowl. Big banner out front said \""Super Bowl Party till 2am\"". The bouncer assured us the kitchen was still open and invited us in. \nThe place still had a few people in it but no problem getting a bartender right away and asking for a menu with our drinks. We then looked over the menu and purposely ordered something that would require a minimal amount of effort to make and clean up in case the cooks had already started to close down the kitchen.\nThat was the last time we ever talked to our bartender or any other staff in the building. \nAfter about 20mins I personally went to check on the status of our nachos as the kitchen is open for the public to view. I saw the forgotten nachos burnt under the heat lamp. We were the only people to order food so I can see how it might be easy to forget. I mentioned something to a cook to remind him about the nachos then went back to my empty drink at the bar. Another 10mins or so before the cook took initiative and delivered us a plate of nachos that was not only burnt but now had been sitting so long they were cold. I might add the toppings were pretty light. Its a stretch to label this plate of chips \""nachos\"".\nBy now the crowd had dwindled to mostly employees on or off the clock. It took another 10mins or so before anyone wearing a loco patron shirt came to check on us. I then told the bartender to forget about the nachos and bring the bill for the drinks. No wait on that. \n\nIf you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking I've found food and drinks still open on a Sunday night. Take down your signs that boast you'll be open till 2am. And if you forget someone's nachos and get called out on it, have the decency to at least reheat and sprinkle some fresh tomatoes on those stale ass chips before serving them."
0,"Spirit was the cheapest airfare I found for a last minute flight from LAX to the Bay Area, and now I understand why. My flight costed me only $64, as compared to other airlines who were charging $180+, but...I have a three hour layover in Vegas, which by the way, is where I am drafting this review as I wait to board my next plane to Oakland. Some might say time is money, but I didn't really mind the layover. Besides now I have a few extra hours to catch up on my reviews. \n\nSo why the two stars? Oh where do I begin...\n\nWhen I checked-in online, I found that you are only allowed one personal bag (handbag, small backpack, etc.) free of charge and that they charge $35 for a carry-on, and even more for checked bags. But on that same page, they disclose that umbrellas, baby diaper bags, cameras, or food for the flight are not counted as carry-ons. I had an SLR camera bag and a handbag with me and was heading straight to the airport immediately after work, so I couldn't even go home to pack smarter after learning of their baggage fees. Since cameras were not counted as a carry on, I pulled out all the compartment walls from my camera bag to make one big compartment for my handbag. Luckily I had brought my denim LV bag, so it was much more pliable than most bags I have at home, and I carried my camera around my neck. \n\nSo I got around the baggage fee, but then the next page of the online check-in asks you to select a seat for a fee starting at $5. This page almost got me. It says that the green seat is me, grey seats are unavailable, and blue seats are available for purchase/upgrade. I looked up and down the diagram of the plane multiple times, but did not see my seat anywhere. I thought I just had to pick a seat, but anywhere that I clicked on added an additional fee for the seat. My gosh! They charge for carry-on and seats??? Anyway, I decided to skip this step just to see what happens and they randomly assigned me to a seat. I usually prefer the window, but whatevers. I just saved myself $5-15. \n\nFinally, the flight. The plane itself looked pretty new and clean. Leg room wise... like what most people say... are minimal, if any. Lucky for me, I'm not even five feet of height, so there was enough leg room for me. The seats don't recline either, but you probably wouldn't want them to anyway because as Queen Latifah would say in Last Holiday, the person in front of you would practically be sitting in your lap. \n\nSince my fare was so cheap, and I had a layover in Vegas, I was curious to see what the cost of the fare would be to just fly from LAX to LAS (the first flight of my travel). I found that the fare costed $100 more than mine!!! So for my fellow flyers who were stopping in Vegas, they could've booked the LAX to OAK, got off in LAS, and disregard the flight to OAK. But I've heard that then you wouldn't be able to board the returning flight obviously because you're not returning from OAK, so all you have to do is book separate one-way departing and returning flights. \n\n(Lol... as I'm sitting at the gate waiting, a woman just walked by calling Spirit stupid.)\n\n**UPDATE**\nThree hours later, I'm still here in Vegas. And now my flight is delayed two hours. My plane is here, but we're waiting for the flight crew to come in from San Diego. Wtf happened to the crew on the plane that is sitting here at the gate? Now I'm not getting back to the Bay Area till the next morning at 12:40.  Awesome! I'm knocking off a star.\n\n**ANOTHER UPDATE**\nFinally got on the second plane and was not impressed. The plane looked old and dirty. Completely opposite of the first plane. To the point where it was gross. I'm just glad it got me to OAK safely."
1,"horrible horrible horrible. first thing, the WORST HOSPITALITY. staff is very unfriendly, unprofessional, and show a lack of care. secondly very unorganized. I arrived during EDC weekend early only to find out the hotel doesnt allow early check in. fine. so i wait around for my check in time (3pm) when check in time rolls around, i come back to the desk only to see a line almost out the door! The system is down they say and nobody can check in until 5. Great, i had plans for 6 pm. The staff was absolutley rude and didnt even bother to acknowledge any questions or conerns. Too bad this is just the start."
4,"Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta. \n\nThe Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.\n\nYou can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.\n\nBe aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip. \n\nValet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed."
1,"I'm torn. I want to like this place. It used to be one of my favorites. Great beer selection, I like having the option of the chill downstairs and the upstairs for concerts and dance parties, and they put on a lot of really great local acts.\n\nAt the same time, the crowd kind of makes me want to go elsewhere. This place just screams trying-too-hard. It wants to be a Brooklyn hipster bar and doesn't really feel like Pittsburgh. The clientele try to look like American Apparel models and what's with no dancing at dance parties? Lamesauce."
4,"We really liked this place. Tried them on a Groupon and will definitely be back when we come in town. The outside of the place looked a bit scary, but don't let that fool you. It was excellent food! We had the ribs, wonderful, fall of the bone delish! The chicken was just as juicy! The pulled BBQ beef was good too. Potato salad was great too! This is definitely in the top 5 BBQ places we've ever eaten at. Enjoy!"
3,"YAY to amazing service!!! Roka Akor wins hands down for treating my family with class and style for my parents 40th wedding anniversary.  The good was pretty good (nothing really memorable stood out as being amazing for a japanese restaurant...), but the service received by the staff was EXTRAORDINARY!!!   And, the restaurant is classy and cool, which made the experience one that was perfect for their special day.\n\nThe highlight? For dessert, the Roka Akor folk made us an amazing dessert platter on ice. It was B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!!!  It was fancy and really wow'd our family!!!!  \n\nThank you, Roka Akor, for making us feel special.  We heart you!"
0,"What a waste of money! I had the OPI gel manicure last week and it has already peeled off! $45 is ridiculous amount to pay even if it would of lasted 2-3 weeks. I live in Los Angeles and even at the trendy, expensive places you don't pay more than $35. Will not be returning on any of my next visits to Charlotte."
0,"If I could offer a NEGATIVE star, I would. My husband and I went TWICE and the second time, got charged for 3 drinks AFTER dumping OVER $200 into a machine!!!!  I asked to speak to the manager and I was told 'Jason' is the manager and he told ME I played for enough to get free drinks BUT my husband did not so he charged us for his drinks when he ADMITTED I lost HUNDREDS yet, since my husband hadn't played fast enough or list enough....we got charged. The worst part was how INDIGNANT the 'manager' was. THAT is how you treat FOOD gamers and LOCAL customers who OWN a home down the street???  Hope it was worth it....never be back!!!!!!"
2,"Really cute store, although I would say that it's not totally my type of style, I can still appreciate it's uniqueness.  There were some really cute accessories and I loved alot of their shoes.  The shoes were a bit out of my price range at $200+ but I still participated in longing looks and sighs of desire on these really amazing boots they had.  \n\nI think it all depends on what you like, but it's really not me.  There are other boutiques I'd go to before this one."
1,"This place really blows. I went there with 3 of my boys and they screwed up our reservations.  They gave us coupons to use on the buffet but the food was really nasty. If you're in Vegas and want to check out a buffet, don't go here - go to Excalibur. The clubs are pretty crowded but the crowd sucks. Rooms were OK, nothing special. \n\nGuest service did not really do much for us. The hotel is so big that it's practically impossible to provide top notch service. Only good thing was that it was close to other, better hotels like Luxor and Mandalay Bay. MGM is basically a tourist trap for those who are attracted to the price. \n\nI guess you get what you pay for?"
0,"First of all let me give you some background. I have been coming to this Hotel \""Motel\"" every few years since the mid 80's. The only reason i ever started coming here is that my uncle used to play in pool tournaments at this \""Motel\"". Back then it was really a matter of the cheapest room rates we could find and the fact that the pool tournament was held in the Riviera convention center. Even back then this place seemed old and out of date. \n\nIn recent years we have stayed at other Hotels at the other end of the strip so i had not seen the Riv in several years. Needless to say NOTHING has changed for the better. \n\n1) They have moved the front desk area to a different location that i think is 50% the size of the old location. The lines to check in/out are constantly backed up. When we checked in Sat night at 11pm there was still a line of at least 12 people and only 3 employees working. It seemed as though each of them was on their first days work as it took them forever to check people in.\n\n2) Resort Fee: They now charge a \""Resort\"" Fee of $11/day. Our total was $99 for the week. Nowhere in our package deal were we told of this additional fee. So we pay the \""Resort\"" Fee and later ask several different employees where the \""Resort\"" is because from the looks of things this is NOT a \""Resort\"". The employees look at us strange and say Oh! that's for the pool and free wi-fi. OK, there is a pool here but from asking the people who dared enter it, the water was cold. Do they even heat the pool at all? Granted it was 110 this week but straight outta the tap cold water is a bit chilly. Don't forget the pool closes at 8pm.\n\n3) Free Wi-Fi: So supposedly part of your \""Resort\"" Fee is the Free Wi-Fi. Sounds good, right? NOT! The Wi-Fi is terribly slow and looses connection frequently. I noticed this the first night while trying to remote in to my home computer. I called the front desk and asked where the best spot was for the Wi-Fi connection. I expected them to say the lobby or the cafe or something on the main floor but instead the woman told me that \""umm well there is no Wi-Fi anywhere but the rooms\"". She also said sometimes you can get a connection out at the pool. As i am writing this, my brother was typing up a long reply to a Craigslist Ad and he went to send it and the connection was lost and so was the whole long reply he was typing up.\n\n4) Smelly hallways: As we reached our floor, the first night, we exited the elevator and there was a strong smell of Marijuana in the air. We don't smoke it but do know what it smells like. As we traveled down the hallway we saw a police officer and the maids standing in the hallway with a rooms door open. They must have thrown someone out and were cleaning the room at midnight. They were vacuuming at midnight, we could not believe it.\n\n5) Smelly Entrance: Several times we noticed a horrible odor when leaving the lobby doors to go out to the parking structure. It smelled like a grease trap overflow. For those who have never worked in the restaurant business. The grease trap is where all the solids and grease collects after it goes down the drain. There is bacteria that eats this rotting food but when it can't keep up the trap overflows and you get to smell all the rotting food that has been sitting there churning. That is what it smelled like several times as we walked out of the main doors. \n\n6) No clean sheets: We have been here for almost a week now and the maids have been in 4 times and made the beds but didn't change the sheets. The first couple times i thought they had but then i noticed the same black mark on my white sheets. It was there every day. They would come in and leave new towels and make the beds but not use clean sheets. Honestly i don't care because i would rather maids not come in my room at all while I'm staying somewhere but for some reason our \""Do Not Disturb\"" signs would vanish and we would have \""made beds\"" when we returned. Makes me wonder if it is just the maids themselves taking the signs off to gain access to my room or other peoples rooms. \n\n7) Food amenities: Years ago when i would come here you could either hit up the food court or the regular restaurant until later in the night. Now both of them seem to close very early. I was told by one employee that the restaurant closes at 7pm. Well that is after telling me 6pm then 6:30pm, he finally settled on 7pm. It's bad when the guy inside the restaurant could not even tell us what time the place closed. So we went to the New Asian restaurant and had 2 entrees and 2 sodas and our total was $40. Now when i say entree i mean rice with a chicken dish and rice with a beef dish. Anywhere else i would pay less that $10 each. The other option was a British type bar that sold a few food items that we thought were overpriced bar food. Oh, wait! They do have a $20+ dollar a plate steak house that we never saw anyone enter. They did have a nice dressed Host and Hostess though. \n\nLooks like I'm out of characters..."
3,Love this place's food!!! Not my favorite place but good when I don't feel like driving too far for good Chinese food!! Best of all; they deliver!!!
0,Completely tasteless broth... maybe it was water.\n\nGo to Lemongrass down the street.\n\nVery dissapointing.
1,"The food is decent but this place is FILTHY! The bathroom had pee everywhere! The staff was just standing behind the counter while they were out of three kinds of beverages. It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time. I like the food but I'll never eat at a baja fresh again!"
0,"Went in last night with a party of 5.  Unfortunately the service was really off.  Having dined here a few times with solid results, I was underwhelmed by this meal.  Took about 20 minutes to get the drinks out, was served appetizers with no silverware, soup was barely warm 1st time, 2nd try hot with a skin, mains sat for 15 min on a tray waiting to be served.  Spoke with the manager and he end up taking one of the mains off the bill.  Way to much competition in steakhouses at this price point to risk a repeat of this experience."
3,I love the camarones mojo de ajo! or .... garlic shrimp ;) the guacamole is fresh and plentiful as the free chips and salsa they do most of their dish justice and the happy hour is truly HAPPY!. kicking back with a few margaritas doesn't hurt either
4,"Tony was a lot of help. I told him what i was wanting and where i had found the helmet. He told me the pros and con about what i was looking at. I went back the next day to buy my helmet, Tony was not there but another worker was more then willing to help.  Will be going back here for more stuff."
1,"I've been to this Fuel Pizza before and would have given it an extra star, but this time around, have to give it a 2.  Reason being, my slice of pepporoni was floating in grease.  Now on the other hand my slice of just cheese was fine, so I guess if you don't add any kind of meat on the pizza, you'll probably be alright.  But, you can't judge a pizza parlor by just it's pizza, can you?\nThe garlic knots were warm and fresh, with just enough garlic, served with a wonderful, tomatoey, garlic, oregano and basil laced dipping sauce.  It was so good, I dipped my puffy pizza crust end in it just to have something to sop it up with.\nMy friend ordered a side salad with her slice and the caesar dressing.  I took a swipe off of her dressing lid, and mmmmm, it was very good...didn't know if it was homemade, or a really great bottled dressing you pay an arm and a leg for at Harris Teeter.\nSince this particular Fuel is housed in was once a filling station, there's lots of old auto memorabilia as well as .....well...memorabilia of all sorts.  There's also lots of customer decorated paper plates on the wall and some of them are really creative and artistic.....must be lots of NODA customers going there!\nAnd, the prices are good and the staff were very nice and quick!  It may have been an off day for them, and I expected better, but if I were that way again, I would probably order a pie to go, sans the pepperoni.  Anyone know how much grease a green pepper would put out?"
3,"Live band playing while you grab a drink , that sounds like a really good deal"
3,"The one thing I love most about Parisian Day Spa is its luxurious atmosphere! It's not easy to find since it's a bit hidden in the complex and can't be seen from the street (Enter the complex from Coronado Center and go right, the entrance faces South). However, once you find it and open the door of this unassuming business complex, you're in a completely different world. The spa is very spacious with different areas for each type of station (hair, nails, pedicures). The actual spa area is beautiful! It's closed for privacy and has a relaxing area for you and your guests (perfect for a bridal party!) and private rooms for other salon services. The receptionists and owner are all very friendly! I visited a few times for manicures and pedicures, bringing my mom, and also referring others. It was always a wonderful experience! I definitely recommend this spa for girls days, birthdays, or weddings since you'll definitely feel pampered."
0,"I hate giving places such low reviews, but this place deserves it.  \n\nI went here on a Friday night around 7 and my party was the only table in the restaurant.  To be fair, there were several people in the bar area, but still, this is also a restaurant.\n\nAnyway, I had high hopes for this place.  When you walk in the decor is very nice, and has an inviting, contemporary feel.  The wait staff is also very friendly and almost immediately brought out some of their plantains and dipping sauce.  This was a great start, but that basically ended when I bit into the plantain.  They were pretty much flavorless and really lacked the correct consistency.  \n\nWe then started with a couple of martinis.  This was something that they are known for.  They were decent, but I think it is really hit or miss with their drinks.  I have had way better, for way cheaper.  I ordered the Threesome, which was not very good. I wouldn't recommend this drink, even though it is highly recommended by the bartenders and waitstaff.  I tasted 2 others, both of which were not outstanding at $9.  For that price, I expect better quality.\n\nMoving on to the main dish.  To be fair, I didn't order the latin flavored cuisine, but I really wasn't feeling it after tasting the plantains.  I ordered a the green chili burger.  Where to start with this one.  I ordered it medium-well, and the burger basically came out burnt.  On top of that, I tasted no green chilis, and the bun was basically a something I could go down to the super market to get.  Maybe the latin food is better, but I will let other people find that out.\n\nAlso, they messed up my friend's order, however, we were so hungry we didn't want to send it back or mention it.\n\nThe fries were very good.  I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries and that is the only thing I enjoyed while eating here.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend eating at this restaurant.  There is much better in Scottsdale. \n\nThey do have a decent happy hour though, which may be the only reason I would ever return."
1,"Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.  \nThe staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first."
1,"Going to them is evidence of my masochistic streak, I think. Or maybe I'm just a slow learner.\n\nIn the 15 years or so I've used them--and I by no means get car full-service car washes frequently-- I have needed to take my car back to them several times for various reasons, or I just didn't accept it when the drying guy raised his rag and said Mali-VOO or whatever I was driving at the time. They've left china pencil marks on windows (that they put there), streaks on the finish, ashtrays full, neglected entire swaths of dashboard surface,  They also -- while doing a costly pre-sale detail job for me --managed to buff some circular patterns in to the tailgate of an F150 that then wouldn't buff-out. \n\nSo I gave them one more chance this week, after having been away for 5 years. I bought the \""works\"" wash.\n\nResult: Dust on the dash, streaks on the windows, some bird crap left on the trunk.\n\nCome on, guys. . . .  geez . . . . \n\nSo I'm going to try somewhere else. Getting my car washed there is too much work for me."
1,"The former Imperial Palace is undergoing some big renovations. So far the lobby and casino floor are looking way different. You no longer enter from the front-the lobby drop off is on the side by the outdoor Harrah's Bar. The Rock Bar that used to sit on the strip is gone, but the other restaurants inside are still there. I'm so glad nothing happened to the Hash House a Go Go! \nThe new carpet is typical gaudy Vegas carpeting, but the tile flooring is looking good. The lobby check in system needs to be faster, and maybe setup differently. It moves way too slow. \nThe gaming floor looks smaller in size, but it's not finished yet so I'm sure more is on the way. The rest of the Quad looks exactly the same. The horribly slow elevators, the buckled, dirty carpeting in the hallways, and the outdated drab hotel rooms. I met two friendly hotel staff members (the lady who checked us in at the desk who was also from Scottsdale, and our maid). Otherwise, everyone else seemed tired, unfriendly, like they hated their job and weren't afraid to let it show. Then why have I stayed here so many times? Well, it's cheap, and the location can't be beat. I'd much rather save some money staying here and spend it elsewhere in Vegas. Make sense right? I had better experiences at the old IP but maybe better times are on the horizon for The Quad."
2,"This place is about an average size outlet.  Probably the best prices around in the area.\n\nThe security guards zip through everyone on their segways which is probably a bit dangerous.  Maybe they thought they were cool to be able to use one or something, but they should slow down.\n\nIt was pretty busy with a lot of travelers too."
4,Heard about this place for the first time about a month ago from a friend. Tried it out and loved the 3 different kinds of mac n cheese that we got.  Wen't back for lunch the other day and had amazing service. Mac N Cheese isn't a hard dish to make but these guys do it GREAT.  Totally can not wait for one to open up on my side of town.  If you love mac n cheese then give these guys a shot.
3,"I just had lunch on the patio at the Country Club at Wynn Resorts and I must say that it was an experience that caught me by surprise! I work Monday-Friday 8:30am-5pm in an office, with no windows might I add, and getting out for lunch to the Country Club at Wynn just brightened my day to the fullest. The view from the patio was so surreal because it didn't even feel like you were in Vegas. It overlooks the golf course with this immaculate waterfall, it just sounded, smelled and felt amazing to be outside (in January might I add) and be comfortable. It is also a plus, since I have lived in lush places such as Oregon and Hawaii to see GRASS for what seemed like miles! ;o)\n\nNow onto the lunch, it was very good! \n\nWe had the cocktail shrimp to start, they were huge succulent shrimp (you only get three for $19 so a little $$$, but very good) the cocktail sauce had chopped red onion and was very flavorful.  I had a Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad, that was very tasty, dressing was a little on the heavy side, but luckily the dressing wasn't fishy at all so that was a plus. \n\nOverall, this was a lunch-break to remember, it revamped and rejuvenated me to finish the rest of the day strong! \n(But I would be lying if I didn't say I almost wanted to take the rest of the day off and just hang out on the patio and drink some Riesling.)"
4,"I had my first Zooks experience yesterday for lunch.  Carole the owner of Zooks created great place to go in District 4. I got the #30, a creative combination of ham, brie, apricot and roasted almonds, my mouth is still watering from it.  Not only was the sandwich amazing but Carole suggested that my team and I try the kale salad and the oatmeal cake, what a good suggestion that was. It was an amazing lunch and can't wait to come back with my team."
1,I commend Dave for responding to my initial review and can say he himself does good work as I saw before and after of a friends car he had worked on previously.
4,"Today was my birthday. \nI had paid a visit to this place when it first opened, but today, my friend surprised me with the most amazing Hetalia poster. \nIt came from this wonderful little store, with the amazing stock and kind workers.\nAmazing place, I will be spending my birthday money here...!! ^-^\n(wow I said \""amazing\"" a lot XD)"
0,I can't believe they don't price match... That's crazy now a days.  The People that work here think they are Rock Stars.  Glad you are cool dude.   I say minimum-wage.
4,5 stars for 4 star service ? Why because all fast food places have their issues. This location is no different. The advantage? Management makes the difference. I eat here too much and when I have had issues not only have they made it good but they've implemented some course of action to do something to make headway for the next time.
1,"Newly added to the Copper Square restaurant scene is Sonoma Casual Dining. While the name leaves as much to be desired as \""Snakes On A Plane\"" the menu plays out in much the same fashion. On possibly the most up-and-coming corner along the lightrail, Sonoma has opened on the corner of 1st Ave and Van Buren, directly across from Central Station. This prime location should provide ample foot traffic once the lightrail hub begins to buzz.\n\nIt is unfortunate because those passengers will not find much at Sonoma. The place is usually packed with an after-work crowd drinking and listening to the live music on the weekends. They seem to be lacking diners however, after 2pm. While this Order/Take Number/Wait style may work well for the on-the-go lunch crowd, it translates poorly for the dinner bunch. Casual is one thing, sloppy is another.\n\nA ridiculous abundance of chicken on their menu begins to make me feel like I am back at Lo Lo's. The problem is, this chicken is over cooked (a-la Zoe's). Featuring a \""rotisserie\"" along with a menu of fake Italian dishes and something called a \""Cowboy Steak\"" one needs to worry if the owners have ever been to Sonoma.\n\nThey are clearly trying too hard and have lost their direction; recently opening up an espresso stand and smoothie bar. \""Inexpensive Excellence\"" is the motto at Sonoma but at $8 a plate the price seems high for lunch and the quality seems dismal for a place striving for excellence.\n\nSonoma also serves breakfast and has a full wine list. By the time you've read this review, there will probably be a kid-play area and they will serve bagels & cream cheese too."
0,This is the worse airline that i have ever been on in my life...like dam all the extra charges and rhe 3 hour delay flight. All they know is control tower held up everything...aaaaaaa naw....i mean dam no discount no free food nothing to nake up me being in a airport waiting station. I just want to go home. I would give it half a star or a quarter of a star just for all the bullshit.
3,"A narrow unprepossessing lobby/cafe. The combo worked surprisingly well.Young educated polite patient helpful/attentive mellifluous staff taking their cues from hardworking professional and elegant general manager Joelle Beaulieu.\""we are happy to have you here\""The  were  bit dark for me ; unavoidable given the vintage building . Great location.Cramped front door Competitive rates.Interesting clientele."
3,"My mom & I were looking for a healthy place to have lunch yesterday, so I did a search for healthy spots near my work & Luci's was the 1st place to come up. Finding a parking spot was kind of hard, we drove around twice & then finally someone was backing out so we scored a spot. We made our way over to the cafe side & looked over the menu. I got the strawberry patch salad (added chicken) & my mom got the veggie head salad. For drinks I got the pomegranate citrus iced tea & my mom, who always asks if places carry diet sprite/7up (they NEVER do), settled for a stevia sweetened lemon-lime soda. I LOVED my salad, although I wish the chicken was grilled, my mom said hers was pretty good. I really liked my iced tea, so refreshing! My mom said  she didn't like her soda, but she drank it all so it probably wasn't that bad. Total for our salads & drinks was about $25. Seems a lil pricey to me, which initially was the reason I wanted to give Luci's 3 stars, but that open garage is just way too cool, so 4 stars it is. If I wasn't trying to be healthy that day I so would have sampled some of the yummy looking desserts, they all looked amazing!"
0,"It's a darn shame, but Community Tire and Auto seems to have crossed the fine line from fair pricing to outright greed.\n\nA recent repair that I had performed by Community Tire and Auto necessitated the replacement of several parts. These parts retail for an amount of X dollars, plus minus 10 dollars, depending where you buy them. When I received the bill, it turned out that Community Tire and Auto charged me !?! X+100 Dollars per part ! !?? \n\nA HUNDRED dollars more than the part costs retail ?! Be aware that I needed several of these parts, so I spent HUNDREDS just on this outrageous markup !? \n\nI would have gladly accepted a 25 or maybe even 30 Dollar markup from the retail price of the part, but a hundred dollars, that's just a smack in the face, and a smack in the face of a loyal customer on top of it.\n\nAt this point I might as well take my car back to the dealership, at least they're somewhat more transparent and logical when it comes to the costs of parts.\n\nThis wasn't the case before, but Community Tire and Auto is now showing a   disturbing trend to maximize profit WITHOUT maximizing value for the customer.\n\nLately, every time I take my car there, there's always an attempt to 'upsell' me and part me from my money, even if the 'work' proposed isn't necessary or even reasonable in terms of pricing.  \n\nIt really is sad, I used to trust this car repair shop blindly, but now they're really no different from any other repair shops that try to maximize profits on the backs of their customers. I do think that there might be a disconnect between upper and middle management here, I have a hard time believing that upper management would condone such practices; it seems the branch/location management seems to be primarily interested in 'upping' the numbers, and not seeing the 'big picture' of the brand as a whole.\n\nAs it stands, I can no longer recommend Community Tire and Auto in Glendale, at least nor for repairs that require any replacement parts. \n\n'Community Tire and Auto' USED to be about quality work at resonable prices... What happened to the Brand, Howard ???\n\nWhat a darn shame!"
0,"I believe this salon is going by a different name these days, the location remains the same. It's located in the mini mall off the the side of a Wal-Mart near Lake Mead. They advertise pedis for 19.99 but it's not a good deal as anyone can do a better job themselves at home. I think my feet actually look worse walking out of this place. It was going well until the guy doing my pedi cut me pretty bad. So bad I cried out in shock and so painful that I couldn't hold a few tears back. Instead of taking care of it he tells me to put my foot back in the water and proceeds to call me a \""big cry baby\"" repeatedly. OK, fine. Why I let him go on is beyond me but I do. Later on he tells me my feet are so nice so he is not going to run a cheese grater looking torture devise over them. Almost done I let him know I will be skipping the polish seeing how I don't want a bunch of chemicals to be poured into my still open wound. Still he goes on to start polishing, now I have to get a little huffy. I mean, come on, you have to learn more English than just insults to get ahead. A few days later my feet are looking so jacked up I have had to fix them twice. Just do not bother with this salon. There are so many more nicer places to go that don't have a \""You break, you buy\"" sign to greet you at the color shelve. Fail!"
0,No sweet n sour on the chicken. Also no veg in the fried rice. Curry was water and no flavor and few carrot and lots potato lil chicken. Plus the salad taste like needs a wash. Spring rolls were the highlight and that isn't saying a thing at all. Overall just a bad experience and when we tried to pay. No cards only cash and no ATM almost just left and wish we had. Never again
1,"It's a shame when one needs to write a poor review but that's what I'm doing. Whether it was our salesman or the poor management attitude, but we could not get information we needed and their prices were high. We wanted prices on some moderate grade carpets but we were constantly steered toward the higher price ones. We wanted a quote on doing our home but was told they don't do that until the installers came out with the job request in their pocket. How can you buy when you are not given the cost in advance? Just a poor experience all the way around."
4,"Come hungry , be prepared for great food and the buttons off your pants to pop off! You will be reminded of the taste of the island!  A friend recommended this restaurant and without a doubt this is one of the best recommendations!\n\nWe are hooked on Aloha Fridays (the only day lau lau is served).  Once they run out their out!  The Kalua Pig and cabbage, Chicken Katsu  and Kalbi Short Ribs are one (and many more) of our favorites.  The Hawaiian Style Saimin soup comes with everything (not like other places that charge extra for wontons or vegetables, crazy!?).  Island Flavor also caters to customers who rather have steak.  The top sirloin and rib eye are served to perfection (tender and juicy) as though it was cooked in a gourmet steakhouse.\n\nNow if you have a sweet tooth for good dessert, this is also the place!  Their Chantilly, Hopia and Guava cakes are to die for! Kona Coffee Mud pie and banana bread pudding are also a must to taste.  You will savor every taste by flavoring each layer of awesome goodness.\n\nThe servings are mammoth and the price is worth every penny, especially when you have enough for another meal the next day!\n\nIsland Flavor has such a welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive!  As often as we eat here, we came in as customers and leave as their friends."
1,"The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find. \n\nAlso, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both \""Hun\"" and \""Sweetheart\"" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The \""I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish\"" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both. \n\nAll in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok."
1,"I've eaten here several times over the past few months, and have generally been impressed by the quality of the food and service. However, on my most recent trip, my experience left a bit to be desired. The teenager making my sandwich ignored my request to leave the onions off of my sandwich (or couldn't hear my response over the loud music, and didn't confirm), and when I took it back up to get it remade without onions, they simply picked the onions out and put it on a new sub roll (and of course missed some in the process). In my many years eating at Quiznos, I have come to expect better service than that, and I will not be returning to this one."
3,"There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations.\n\nFirst off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')\n\nFry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.\n\nSpecifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.\n\nNot all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.\n\nOne word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.\n\nOh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex."
2,"This is the best option for a quick cup of coffee at The Plaza. Large latte with skim and an extra shot was around $5.50, which is not horribly overpriced. Coffee and service were good. Hard to rate over 3 starts for just a latte, but this place is fine for a coffee fix if you are downtown and/or at The Plaza."
1,Very nice atmosphere service was fast and courteous but Far from I had expected. I had lots of Middle Eastern food in the valley but I never had a chicken shawarma sandwich with lettuce on. Overall the garlic sauce was good and the meat was marinated gooood.  Like they say you get what you pay for. The $5 choose your sandwich with salad lunch special is very inexpensive but I won't be returning.
0,"Worst food ever... It was cold. The crab was verrrry small, fried. They did not even offer butter for it.  I don't recommend this place and will NEVER go back there!"
1,"Sigh. I really hate it that I like Starbucks coffee better than the local guys, but in most cases it's true. Still looking for my perfect latte in Madison at a mom & pop shop. Definitely didn't find it at Espresso Royale. My latte tasted like it was made with kerosene instead of espresso.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the ambiance was fine, but if I've gotta buy something to get the free wifi, I want it to go down easy."
4,My name is Jill and I have a mild addiction to their steak plate. I usually come home from tempe and just grub until I can't breathe from their food. So good. great service and they know your order if you go there enough.\nI can't say enough great things about this place:)
3,We have taken all three kids there for their 21st birthdays. Good German food & beer. Love the band singing drinking songs. Great atmosphere. Have been to the one in Munich several times so I can compare. This is the first time we had been there without a group. Still had fun with the people at our table. Take a taxi from the strip and you will not be sorry.
4,"OK, they recently took away my biggest complaint, they added sun sades to block out the blinding late afternoon sun. So now it should be way more comfortable for those facing the windows and even if you are not, you don't have to contend with the over brightness!!  Now if I just had some painting talent!!"
1,"Overpriced Panda Express. I paid $150 for two people, and our food was mediocre at best. I ordered the lemon chicken, and she ordered the salmon. Her salmon was ok, but definitely not $40 ok. My lemon chicken tasted straight from Costco."
3,"It's almost impossible to review an entire park like Piestewa Peak in just one hike so I'll preface this review by saying this only encompasses the 32nd St Trailhead and the #8A Quartz Ridge Trail. Evidently this is my sister's go-to spot for a quick and (relatively) easy hike by her house. Here's a breakdown:\n\nParking- There's a parking lot off N 32nd St & E Lincoln Rd on E Sierra Vista Dr that holds maybe 20-25 cars and fills up pretty quickly according to my sis. She usually just skips it and heads straight for the shopping center across the way.\n\nRestroom- There are no restrooms at the 32nd St Trailhead, but there are park restrooms on E Squaw Peak Dr, but I would just ignore those and head for the Starbucks in the aforementioned shopping center--evidently they don't mind since a preponderance of their business seems to be hikers.\n\nTrails- The trails themselves are in pretty rough shape and have lots of loose rocks and jagged edges that create a pretty hazardous situation if you're not watching where you're going; they're also really narrow in some spots and are barely wide enough for an adult.  Unfortunately you find yourself staring at the ground 90% of the time and kinda lose the fact that you're in a really beautiful area. \n\nScenery- Excellent scenery with lots of different cacti scattered throughout the trail; great views of Downtown Phoenix; and there's even a decent view of Camelback Mountain. Not much shade here, but you're in the Sonoran Desert so bring a hat and some water. \n\nDifficulty- On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate this at a 4 for an adult and maybe an 8 for kids. My 3-year-old did most of it on his own and I only had to carry him over a few really rough patches--but he's a more experienced hiker than some adults. There's also the weather here in AZ that could add a +3 to all those numbers but we lucked out and went on a spectacular Spring Day. \n\nI really wanted to give this trail a 3-star rating but I had a hard time justifying that in my head because we all had a good time and the views are definitely worth the effort. The 32nd St Trailhead gets a thumbs up from yours truly."
0,"Yuck. \n\nMy husband and I went here for a date - trying out something new. At the end of the date we had both wished we hadn't. \n\nTo start - the location is cool, I am a fan of water street. But the inside of the restaurant looks like someone is really into going to garage sales and just keeps piling up crap upon crap upon crap to decorate. It's terrible! There are more decorations in that one little room than there is in an entire knick knack shop! Also, the big statue in front - creepy. Not cute. \n\nThe bathroom decor is super confusing, signs for love, and then on the opposite wall old advertisements for beverage flavorings...What???\n\nAlright lets move on to the staff. Our waitress, was terrible. We had told her it was our first time and she didn't care to introduce us, explain anything, NOTHING. It was our first time ordering and she offered a side that neither one of us understood and after thinking that she explained it my husband just decided to order the pasta. \nShe never checked on us once throughout the entire evening. We got more attention from the bus boy and the hostess. \n\nOnto the food....the bread appetizer, was the BEST part. And I'm pretty sure I've purchased the exact same loaf of bread at Albertsons, on many, many occasions. I ordered the chicken penne, when it came out the sauce was SUPER thin and there was tons of water and oil in the bottom of my dish. It was disgusting. The taste was non-existant. My husband ordered the chicken parmesan. The breading of the chicken was soggy, someone does NOT know how to prepare chicken parmesan. Someone had DUMPED marinara sauce onto the chicken. Once again - disgusting. \n\nEverything tasted frozen, pre-bought, and canned. For the price I could have made 100x better than either what I OR my husband had ordered. It seems as though the chef doesn't care about his or her food. \n\n\nWe will NOT be coming back."
4,"I was so worried about leaving our former pound puppy somewhere. We didn't want her to feel abandoned. Well, we lucked out when we found Luxe on Yelp. Gracie was happy & tired when I picked her up. They sent pictures nearly everyday & she always looked so happy. She even found a new boyfriend & lots of friends. Clean, great people & lots of attention. Never again I'll feel guilty leaving Gracie. She had a blast. Highly recommend Luxe! Just please don't book up every room, she be back!!"
3,One of my favorite happy hour places in the Scottsdale area. The staff is always prompt and friendly without being over bearing and their menu is very solid.  \n\nMake sure you give any of their oven cooked flat breads a try as they are all fantastic
4,"Best pho in PHX hands down. #13 is my all time fave. the fresh rolls with shrimp and pork are also divine.\nthey seat you quickly, serve your food within a few minutes of ordering, and send you on your way happy as can be.\n\nunPhogettable.. that's what you areee."
1,"I am currently attending Nevada State College right now, and I love the faculty and the classes (ecspecially Lori Fazzino's Sociology 101 class) but they need to seriously work on either hiring smarter people in the financial aid office or a better computer system. Here is my story:\n\nIn mid August, I hadn't recieved any notice about my financial aid money that was suppose to go toward my $2,000 debt for tuition. I ended up just going to their building and being told that they were missing information needed to recieve the loan money. Why they couldn't have told me this when I applied for enrollment or when I actually enrolled into 4 classes, is beyond me. Isn't that just common sense. \n\nAct 2: Late August. I received an email stating that I recieved 2/3rds of my loan money when I was supposed to and only did recieve 1/2. I again went to there offices and their system messed up and they sent me the rest of the money. Awesome.\n\nToday...this weekend I reccieved an email that I was 30 days past due on a payment. How could that be when my loan paid for everything, because I can't afford it at the time, hence the loan! I check myNSC and saw that I owed the school $4,085! WHAT! So I finally got ahold of them early today and they said that they refunded my loan! How can they do that without communicating that to me is beyond me! I have attended all my classes, I have As and Bs, and midterms are this week and now all that is on my mind is the fact that I have to pay the school money that I do not have! I plan in going into their office in about 2 hours. Hopefully it goes well. I am beyond pissed off! \n\nAll these prolems make me wish I have spent triple the amount of money just to go to UNLV!"
3,"OK, full disclosure: I'd NEVER pay the freight for Aria. I was there on a comped stay. Just saying you might want to know that while you read the review.\n\nThe Place: Location is utterly perfect, next to Bellagio, across the Strip from Planet Hollywood, close to everything else. City Center is a flat-out beautiful space. Ostentatiously spacious with soaring ceilings, gorgeous floors and lots of other fine fixtures in between. Art, art, art everywhere, some of it really good.\n\nThe Hotel: We arrived at 5 pm on Saturday and did not have to wait in line to check in. At a couple other times during our stay, there were some lines at check-in/out, most noticably at about 11:30 on Tuesday morning.  The elevators are separated into banks for the differrent floor levels, which makes the rides quicker. Never waited for an elevator. The room was spacious, well-appointed, clean (it better be for a 6-month-old hotel). One complaint: Someone on the staff had obviously used the room to smoke pot in just prior to our arrival. Bedspread sat on, hand towel used, wrapper from a spray-can of air freshener in the trash. Front desk offered to move us, but the view was so nice, we stayed. The remote-controlled-everything was fun after a bit of figuring out. Very nice bathroom with separate WC and walk-through shower to the soaking tub. Excellent room overall.\n\nThe Casino: Well-designed, spacious, plenty of tables for everything (I hate slot machines, but there were a million). $10 limits during the day, up to $15 at night. Friendly dealers. Not as smoky as most. \n\nThe Restaurants: Skip the buffet. As noted above, I got it free, but still not very good, except for the desserts. Best bet is the Jean Paul Patisserie--great sandwiches and sweets.\n\nThe Pool: Plenty of space, three big pools and three big hot tubs. Am I still a little kid or is it too much to ask for water somewhere in one of those pools that is more than 3.5 ft. deep? There were lifeguards.\n\nThe Staff: All very polite and competent, just not very \""friendly.\""\n\nBottom line: I'd go there again and again if it was free every time."
3,"Hot! Brig a hat, sunscreen, and a water. Out of the three tour guides we had, we only enjoyed one. It was the blonde lady from Ft. Worth, TX. She was fun and gave us great advice on places to go."
4,"Visited Rare Earth with a Groupon with a friend for a Friday lunch.  Shared the Caprese Salad, the Meatball Pizza and a glass of Boom Boom Syrah (OK, that I didn't share but my friend was driving soooo...)\n\nI will definately be back even without the Groupon, the salad was amazing the pizza was thin and crispy, perfectly done, and the bartender/server Robert was wonderfully attentive!!\n\nLooking forward to bringing a date or a group of friends !!!"
3,Great service . A lot of food with every meal we ordered ! Good guys place for sure ! I would definitely eat here again . The enchiladas suizas were awesome !
2,Fun bar/restaurant but for whatever reason it feels a bit like South Side in Lawrenceville there. I live down the street and was hoping to spend everyday at IPH since it's such a cool space but it's so impersonal and expensive (for a bar) I find myself choosing Tender or Thunderbirds over here. Beautiful interior though and the food is pretty good too.
4,"Went here for the first time tonight for happy hour and had a great time! Tried the Mac n cheese balls and the chicken appetizers ( both were 5 bucks during happy hour) and they were super good. The drinks aren't too pricey, I think around $8. Got the \""stranger danger\"" and I thought it tasted like a yummy iced tea. Cool decor and the back patio is set up really neat, with misters to help beat the heat. We will be back again!"
4,"I have always driven past this place, and wanted to give it a try. Last night I was finally able to try this place, and I can't say enough good things about this place!\n\nThe decorations and atmosphere of the restaurant seems very authentic. As we walked in, we were greeted by two beautiful smiles. We were seated within 10 minutes. It was quite crowded for a Sunday night. \n\nI ordered the shrimp enchiladas and sangria. My husband had the beef tongue tacos. They give you as much chips and dips as you want, and our order also came with a delicious tomato noodle soup. \n\nAll of the food was delicious: Zapata's food is one of the best Mexican foods I have had. Whenever I get the munchies for Mexican food, I know where to come from now on.\n\nExcellent service, and great food and drinks. Definitely would like to come back for my birthday celebration dinner!"
3,"I'm still kind of a newbie when it comes to Thai food, but I do love curry, and Lotus of Siam's was awesome! I came here for lunch with some friends that swore \""it's the best Thai food they've ever had\"".  \nI had the green curry and tofu over sticky rice. It was the perfect spice level. I also tasted my friends beef satays with peanut sauce which were delicious! \nIt was very busy on a Tuesday afternoon, and we waited about 20 minutes, but it was worth it! \nI will definitely come back and try some of their recommended specialty dishes. I'm especially intrigued by the koong sarong (bacon and wonton wrapped prawns) yum!\n Soon, I will be a Thai food connoisseur!"
2,"There's only 2 things that make Indian-owned casinos okay: \n\n1. Winning.\n\n2. Indian Fry-bread w/ honey and powdered sugar. Ecstasy. \n\n\nThe only other comments I have are that it's smaller than SD casinos, and you get no kind of cell phone reception here, which makes finding people in your party much, much harder."
4,"Nothing bad to say about this place.  I came in this morning and even though there were a couple people ahead of me and the guy was running everything by himself, I was still in and out within a reasonable amount of time.  Very fast and efficient and honored the discount for mentioning yelp.\n\nI will definitely be coming here from now on instead of Jiffy Lube."
2,"The way it was talked up, I was expecting great pizza.   What I got was good, not great.   \n\nIt has a wide variety of options, chicken wings were not bad either."
1,"Crappy service, good food. The club was OK - too pretentious for my taste."
0,"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. They are horrible people. My father lived here and passed away. After a verbal agreement to clear out his apartment when I flew In for his funeral I got there and they were painting the apartment all his stuff was gone!!!!! They did whatever they wanted to with it and that should have been my choice! What kind of people do that to others? I did alot of research when trying to track down someone who would at least apologize, to find out this place is owned by a Christian relief service. Really? A Christian relief service....wow! \n(This review is written based on my own opinion, experience, and research)"
4,They have a GREAT happy hour. I have loved everything I had here. The crab cakes are wonderful.
1,2 stars and five words: GO TO THE BELLAGIO INSTEAD
3,"Good food--simple, affordable and delicious!  Had the combo plate with brown rice and mac salad.  Good sized portions, and the service was friendly.  Kimchi and boiled peanuts were yummy!"
3,"It's about time I reviewed a place I have been eating at for over 4 years.  Good middle eastern food with UNLV specials, Stephano's gives that free drink with plates or sandwiches with a side dish.  They have a frequent diner card so the 10th trip is free.\n\nI am partial to the kofte sandwich lately, and I have always been a big fan of the lentil rice with caramelized onions as a side dish.  The falafel is decent when I really crave it, but I try to avoid majorly fried food if I can.  The plates are good to get if you are super hungry, because they include meat (gyro, chicken or beef) and onions, tomatoes, pita, tzatziki, and Israeli salad.\n\nAnother big plate is the Vegetarian plate, and it comes with spanokopita, hummus, tabouli, dolmas, falafel....so it is quite huge.  The other thing I like is the tropical iced tea here.  Big screen TVs, huge couches, and yummy food make this place a convenient stop for lunch."
4,"505, Marilyn Monroe, Smore's, frozen popcorn - the mind spins at the choices.  The owner I met was so friendly, and helpful.  Definitely a great gift for the 'snacker' who thinks they've tasted it all!  \nI didn't think it was expensive and I'm definitely going back for more!"
2,"I'll be honest.  Margaritaville was my not first choice.  It was pre-concert and we had naively intended to dine at Yard House but upon hearing it was AN HOUR AND A HALF wait, we opted to eat here.  While we waited for a table, we got margaritas at the bar.  I opted for a mango margarita....  and I think they cheat.  I think they have a \""main\"" frozen margarita mix and then they just add whatever flavor you choose.  While my margarita did have chunks of mango in it, it had an odd chemical taste that I was not digging.  My companion enjoyed hers though (and tasted mine to make sure they were the same) so maybe it's just me.  \n\nWe ordered the Volcano Nachos or Nachos Volcano or The Incredible Stack of Goodness.  Because it was.  It was delicious and the two of us barely put in a dent in it.  \n\nService was sketchy.  It was good initially but we sat for quite a while waiting for check.  Normally, I wouldn't be too concerned about that but we had show tickets and one does not keep Justin Timberlake waiting."
1,"Really just made me wish we had an auto vehicle and could sputter to an off-the-strip In-N-Out.\n\nWatching football on a breezy patio was a nice alternative to the smoke-infested sports books, though."
0,We decided to stop in for dinner hearing great things about the old location. We were surprised at the overpriced menu and should have gotten up and left but decided to try it. The place was slow and server still did not get order correct which was just a pizza with pepperoni and ricotta cheese. My husband had the sausage and mushroom and neither of us was impressed considering for two pizzas and an iced tea it was $38 plus tip. We will definitely not be going back!
3,"Legit Iced Tea!\n\nDavid's kind of reminds me of our version of Teavana. Hundreds of canisters of teas ranging from black to green to white, oolong etc...you name it, they have it in every flavor, scent, fruit whatever! \n\nSo I was on the search for a real iced tea. Just tea, with ice. David's lured me in with a free sample which was then explained that they will make it into iced tea. FINALLY! And it was delicious too.\n\nThey also have/had a travel cup for iced tea which was about $10, but allows you refills at $1 instead of the full price which, if I were living in MTL right the heck now, I would totally be in for that."
0,"The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish, which we thought was an interesting combo. I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back"
4,"Best kept secret....shhhhh.  The Southwestern Chorizo eggs benedict on corn cakes is the best breakfast!  Even their coffee tastes great.  The food served here is creative and quality.  It is not your run of the mill coffee shop food by no means.  The view is beautiful, too.  Open to the public and non-golfers!!!!!  ENJOY!"
2,"What a disappointment! I remember going there couple years ago and the food was so wonderful. We went to Le Village last weekend for Sunday brunch. The line was 45 minutes long, which is fine for Vegas buffet on the weekends I guess. I kept telling my b-friend that the wait is worth it and he won't be disappointed. Sure enough, I had to admit at the end of our brunch that it wasn't anything special. Nothing to write home about. The only thing I remember was good the crepe with blueberries and chocolate. The staff is not very friendly, they all looked grumpy and ignorant. Choose something else for a buffet, this one is not worth it."
3,The ruben was above average and the rootbeer float uses rootbeer they make themselves right onsite! This is a great place to take the kids. I'll be back soon.\n\nP.S. The cottage cheese is fantastic.
2,"I got a mamacita burger, pepper jack, avocado, jalepenos, and the normal salad stuff.  The burger was over done for me but I eat a seared burger.  Other than that it was a good burger nothing I would run after to get but some of the other burgers might be better.  If I see them again Ill give them a shot.  The chili cheese fries are lacking the cheese is over whelmed by the chili and it just wasn't that great not bad but not great.  IDK im on the fence on this truck."
2,"Alright, since I'm already not a fan of ice cream, I'll try to make this as unbiased as possible.\n\nI came in with my friend and I initially planned on not ordering at all. However, they had some kind of special going on where you text a number and your ice cream sandwich is buy one get one free. So I went ahead and texted the number, and showed my phone to the cashier who told me that my ice cream sandwich would be free if my friend bought one. After picking out what I wanted (I had mint chocolate chip w/ mint chocolate cookies), and after my friend pays for his, we were about to walk out.\n\nSuddenly the cashier yells, \""So which one of you is paying for that?\""\n\nAre you serious? Your promotion says it was free and you JUST told me it would be free. Buy one get one free right? My friend bought one. We get one free, right?\n\nI didn't carry any money on me, which is why I wasn't planning on getting anything in the first place. My friend ended up paying for two, and I had to pay him back later. As he was paying the cashier (a guy) was eyeing us down the whole time like we were thieves.\n\nIf their ice cream was not exceptional, I would have given this place 1 star. 3 stars for the ice cream, nothing else."
2,"I picked up a couple biryani dishes and some naan for lunch.  The biryani was good although, apparently, the blander palate of Wisconsonites has affected their judgement.  I ordered \""extremely hot\"" and took pains to explain that I know heat and wanted it so hot his grandpa wouldn't eat it.  It may have had a dash of pepper in it, but I'd give it \""Mild\"" at best.  The naan was a little ho-hum.  I've had much better naan."
2,"I hate Walmart but they carry Mobil1 oil cheaper than anyone else.  I usually try to avoid this store during the day and go at night since it is 24 hours.  Also, the people at the auto service department are pretty nice."
3,"Finally somewhere in my neighborhood that has good craft beer and atmosphere!! Inside looks completely different from the outside. Its large but still welcoming inside. Pool tables, tv's all over the place, booth seating and of course bar seating.\n\nHappy hour every day until 7pm !! I tried the hummus and devoured the whole thing along with my Guinness.  Good prices and good service.\n\nYou will see me here again, it's a given.\n\nThey have beer flights."
0,"This is the WORST property management company I have ever dealt with. For a while there was NO emergency contact number so if something went wrong with your property on an off hour (which it generally does) you are left to deal with and pay for the problem.\nWe rented from a house on Swenson St and one night the toilets and sinks overflowed with raw sewage. We tried calling the emergency number to no avail and called a plumber who charged us over $200 and Southwest Management refused to reimburse us! \nWe set-up a walk-thru with our new property manager (after our current one was fired) four times and he never showed. Then, he sent us a letter stating that we weren't letting him on the property! After numerous phone calls and emails he finally returned our call and came by to inspect the house. TWO WEEKS LATER we received a certified letter in the mail stating that they suspected drug usage in the house!!!! \nI have never in my life been so mistreated by a property management company. Do your research before you move and beware Southwest management."
4,"One of the Killers', and especially singer Brandon Flowers', favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. If you want to spot celebrities anywhere, this is the place. Oh right, and the sushi is insanely good too...\n\nFrom LV's Daily Fiaso blog: \""Even family man Brandon Flowers has to eat. Thus we have him being spotted enjoying lunch at Sushi Roku inside the Forum Shops at Caesars today with family in tow. Reportedly, the singer is a frequent visitor of the acclaimed restaurant.\""\nhttp://thesponge-dani.blogspot.com/2011/10/victims-pilgrimage-killers-fans-guide.html"
1,"Everything about this place is average or slightly below average.  I came in with a large group, so I got to see a lot of the different menu items and they were all very bland.  We ordered a few platters of the Soul Sampler, which was overpriced and overcooked.  My cowboy burger had a lot of potential, but the hockey puck that came slapped in between the bun really was disappointing.  I will say they made a nice bloody mary.  I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage."
0,"I've been stopping by Last Chance everytime I'm in the Biltmore area since I moved to Phoenix in 1998.  I just stopped by again today...what a big fat waste of time!!!  I'm not sure what draws me back to this place, is it the \""bargain basement\"" feel, the racks of used shoes, the frenzy of women hunting around for that amazing treasure?  I have no idea, but this place sucks!!!!!!!  I\""ve probably found no more than a half a dozen \""deals\"" in the eleven years I've been frequenting this glorified Good Will.  I completely scoured the racks today and found NOTHING that I would have taken home for free.  The clothes are gargage sale quality and the shoes and purses are pathetic.  How about a nicely scuffed up pair of Michael Kors (ugly) pumps for $49.99?  COME ON!!!!!\n\nYou're better off upstairs at Marshalls where the stuff doesn't look like it's been through the washing machine.  I think this is finally my LAST stop at LAST Chance, and I'm relieved :)))"
3,"My wife and I liked this place a lot. The wine selection is great and the manager is very knowledgeable and friendly. He made it a point to chat us up and suggest different wines to us one day while he was covering the bar.\n\nWhile their bar chairs are uncomfortable, the table seating works just fine whether you're inside or outside. When I was living in Vegas, my wife and I would always go on their Monday night special 50% off wine nights and after a couple of bottles we'd leave with a couple more."
0,"Who charges $3 for a tiny bottle of water? Total scumbag move, Palms. I loved this place until this moment."
3,"Spicy chicken with brown rice bowl was amazing! Grilled to order, super flavorful! The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the prices are kinda high. Up-charge for brown rice, up-charge for veggies etc. But it's really good food, so I'll be back anyway, just not as often probably."
4,"This hotel is every girls dream house. Pink, sparkling and full of delicious cocktails! I stayed here for my BFF's birthday weekend, and it couldn't of been better. The rooms were plush, with amazing views of the Bellagio fountains. There were pools for every type of experience you were looking for, and the location was right in the heart of it all. Next time I visit Vegas, The Cosmopolitan will be on the top of my list."
4,"Amazing service from Jelly for lunch today, and seriously good food!  A wonderful hot sauce with heat and a great pico start things before you even get to sample the tasty tacos and enchiladas.  Highly recommended."
0,"We spent over $400 dollars to have an amazing birthday party for my 5 year old at the Children's Museum. During this time we purchased a family membership for the year so me and my ex could both take our daughter. When we purchased a family pass they never mentioned that my ex and I had to be in the same household to use the pass and we have successfully enjoyed the museum many times on our pass before today. When my daughter and I tried to use the pass today a very rude woman working the front counter told us that we had to be in the same household to use the pass and I could be put on as a \""nanny\"" if my ex showed up to approve it. Excuse me? I am the MOTHER not a nanny and I was greatly offended. I can't even believe she said that! I can't believe they would rather me lie and say I was my daughter's nanny then tell the truth that I am her mother, but she has two homes one with her dad and one with me.\n\nWe have been coming to the museum for years and it just left a bad taste in my mouth the entire visit. There are so many families that are split up and I should not have to have my daughter embarrassed at the front counter of a museum because her family is different than a traditional family. I am so disappointed and I really hope when I call a manager on Tuesday that there is an apology or we will never spend another dime at this discriminatory establishment!"
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. We got our locks changed for one of our shops today. And Russell is who came for the call. Very unprofessional and cold. Acted as tho we inconvenienced him by scheduling services with this company.  Needless to say I will not be using this company again. And Russell needs customer service training. 189$ to change a lock, and be treated like nobody? NO THANK YOU!"
2,"I like the concept of this restaurant. The name is clever, the decor and employee outfits do well to match the theme, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the female server eye candy. Contrary to some of the reviews I've read, we had good service. He was prompt, friendly, and accurate.\n\nAs for the food, it was pretty good. I ordered the Cali Chicken. I thought the chicken wasn't quite perfectly cooked. It wasn't tough, but it could have been more tender. Overall, the sandwich was tasty. The fries were decent.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, but I have no urge to return. I know it's an unfair comparison, but I'd much rather just go to Fukuburger or Red Robin. Those places are cheaper, but you still get that \""gourmet burger\"" experience."
4,"I have been to this restaurant twice now and I have yet to have bad food. Both times I have been with another person and we swapped lots of food. Everything is pretty spicy but I was also able to order very traditional meals while there. The wait staff is young, but friendly without hovering. The atmosphere is low lit and quiet enough to enjoy a conversation with your food. The food is absolutely outstanding. I can't wait to go back for a third time and try something new."
4,"Mark and I both tried a few places before finding Shampoo Ink on Yelp. Can't say enough about how awesome this place is! Abel (the really hip owner) takes care of Mark's hair - he's got long hair and wants to keep growing. Mark has had some bad experiences in the past and now swears he will go to Abel forever. \n\nAbel's sister Celi is my go-to for color and cuts. She is an awesome stylist and real cool to 'hang' with while I'm there. My hair always turns out exactly the way I want it, to the point where I just let her choose the color because she now knows what I like - no problem with either of them remembering  us from visit to visit, a problem we've both experienced in the past. \n\nThe place is beautiful and inviting. The prices are so much better than any of the other high-end establishments we've tried. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
4,I had a facial with Angie today and it was awesome! She is so knowledgeable and doesn't try to sell you a whole bunch of products. She cares more about what is best for your particular skin and the best way to improve and heal it. She also includes whatever treatments that are needed such as microdermabrasion and oxygen which a lot of other places charge an arm and a leg for separately. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town.
4,"I've used this agency for the last 6 years.  I most recently had to file a claim.  Rebecca at their office handled everything for me from start to finish.  It's hard to tell how good your insurance company is until you need them to pay for something.  \n\nBased on this claim, they are the best!!  I refer all my friends and family to them."
2,"The way I'm drawn to corndogs is magnetic. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Perhaps just a thing? I don't know, but since I think a corn dog is just a hot dog wrapped in a delicious sweater it makes me happy.\n\nBig Hurt's happens to sell corndogs very late into the evening, which is good for late night munchies. They also sell fries that are too salty, unless you really like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good. And, wait for it, cheeseburgers on donuts instead of buns. So, in case all the gambling and drinking doesn't kill you, they've got you covered."
1,"I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note, i seen the Google street view car downtown :)\n\nAnyways, my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.\n\nAlso, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \""deal\"". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours."
1,The best thing about ice house is the brown paper that they use instead of plates. \n\nThey also make a delicious lettuce taco.
4,"I checked this place out when I was in Phoenix for a weekend, as I needed some color for an upcoming wedding. The studio is incredibly cute and the owner made it a point to ensure I was comfortable and satisfied with my results. She gave me a lot of info about the process and about maintaining my tan. My color looks great and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!"
4,"My new favorite Chinese buffet !!! This place rocks , the restaurant itself is clean and very comfortable and the food (lots of it) is great. Every dish i had i wanted more except for the soup i started with.It was the only one with out a name tag and it looked different then any i had ever seen, so i tried it and it tasted like it was only hot water and egg whites.I know not to ever pick that one again. After that everything was great , from the wide array of shrimp dishes to the roast duck  this place has it all and it is all cooked and presented beautifully .So if your hungry for chinese  this is the #1 place , just do not have the egg and hot water soup and you to will be giving JEN a 5 star review as well. YUM !!! YUM!!! YUMMMM!!!!!!!"
1,"The Cup Cakes here are tasty but oh so small. For the price of the cup cakes I would like to see them bigger, 90% of the cupcakes here look like they haven't had enough time in the oven and haven't baked high enough. Although these are tasty little treats the price isn't worth it to me."
2,"Came here for a relaxing dinner on a Tuesday night. The place was only about 50% filled so we were seated right away. \n\nOur waitress was really great and came to our table right away to ask us about drinks. She also had what I like to call \""The Sense\"" which is that she knows how often to check in rather than too much or too little. I've mentioned this before checking-in sense before in previous reviews. Overall she was great. The bus boy was also pretty on point about filling up our waters and bringing out bread. Service was A-OK.\n\nAs for food, the calamari w/ garlic aioli appetizer was definitely a good choice. Awesome to share between 3-4 people. Unfortunately, it was just me and my gf so we got a little bit filled up from it that we weren't fully hungry for our entrees. I ordered the pesto lamb which was tasty but just a little too salty for my taste. The mashed potatoes and spinach it comes with were really good though. She got the prime rib which she really enjoyed and I took a bit and it was legit. \n\nOverall it was a good dining experience. Food was a little too salty for me and a little pricey for where we were but the service was good. No need to come back but a solid choice nonetheless."
4,"this place is very good, better than most Chinese places outside of spring mtn. try it. nice servers."
0,"My brother, BFF, boyfriend and myself decided to check this bar out last night. It was big and bright with nice colorful decor. We wanted to play pool and to our surprise it was only 75 cents! That's hard to find in decent bars. So my brother and boyfriend sit at the bar while my BFF and I set up the pool table. My brother then walks up to me and says the bartender wants to see our IDs. So I took my BFF and my IDs over to the bar and this pathetic excuse of a bartender (blonde with fake chesticles) keeps walking pass me and kept talking to the other customers and paid no mind to us. Not once, but three times she walks pass. My brother extends both IDs so she can see it. Finally she comes up to us and asks what I would like to drink. I said nothing you wanted to see our IDs right? And she goes, \""Oh yeah.\"" Takes a glimpse, and basically shoves it back. Rude, much? Her attitude was so horrid, my brother and boyfriend left the bar area so they didn't have to deal with her attitude. By the way blondie, if you're working for tips, next time, you should be nice to EVERYONE. Because our group was the richest people at the bar at the time and you didn't get a tip from us. You were totally barking up the wrong tree.\n\nwhy one star? POOR SERVICE FROM BLONDIE!"
1,"\""I need pho\"" is what I told myself 10 in the morning after taking my exam and hanging out at Marquee a few hours earlier. Pho Thai Binh must have the coolest sign out of all the Vietnamese places here, so using logic they must be some pretty cool people with some pretty cool pho.. right? \n\nIn 2 minutes I was seated, given water, and my order was in.\n\nMy pho tai nam came out a few degrees short of boiling.. just the way I like it :), BUT a few pieces of my rare steak had dark brown spots.. like when the meat is old. I finish up the rest of the pho and go pay.\n\nThe card minimum is $10 or they will add another dollar to the bill if its under. I'm fine with that, but instead of my bill coming out to be $8 something its $28.59. Uh.. what the pho? The guy apologizes and gives my difference minus 1 dollar. Sorry I don't understand, why am I being charge the extra dollar when you've charged me way over the $10 minimum already? He fixes that and then.. proceeds to asks for tip. Yeah.. I don't think so.\n\nThe pho was mediocore and the service needs to be checked. The only positives here was the super hot broth and cleanliness of the restaurant."
1,"I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.\n\nThe restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.\n\nI opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.\n\nThe tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.\n\nWhen they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.\n\nI really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.\n\nWill I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption."
4,Awesome station!  Until prairie home companion comes on for hours at a time.
4,"This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The room was amazing as well as the customer service. We waited in line for check in for over an hour and thanks to our patience, they upgraded us to a suite on the 12th floor with a view of the mountains. Everything was perfect and super clean, and I'm a clean freak so when I say clean, it was spotless. Every day during our time out, housekeeping would come in and clean up the room again. I never once saw my own mess reflect in the room. On top of cleanliness, the room was very quiet and I'm a light sleeper. It was a rather long walk to do anything in the hotel such as the pools or restaurants, but frankly I prefer to walk and have the rooms quiet. The places to eat are amazing, but very pricey, as with all Vegas restaurants. The beach pool and lazy river were well worth it as well. We stayed at another hotel after our experience here, and it didn't compare or even come close to my standards. We will always look to stay here when we visit Vegas."
4,"I've had an excellent experience at one Macayo's (Central Av, Phx) & an awful one at another (Ash Av, Tempe), so I didn't really know what to expect here, today.  Here's how it went:\n\nStarting off, they brought me plenty of chips.  They were warm & tasty, & the salsa mild but good.  (When the salsa ran low, my server offered me some more.)\n\nThe \""Mex & Match\"" area of the weekday menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices, all the same price each, & one or two of a good number of side dish selections, all the same price each.  It's easy to get a meal of exactly what you want from this menu!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a Shredded Beef Taco for my main items, & Steamed Vegetables & Albondigas Soup for my sides this time.  For the vegetables, they serve you a bunch of different, buttery bite-sized veggie pieces, cooked just right.  The soup was delicious, too.  The Pablano Chile Relleno was a little mild for my taste, but it was BIG, & very well prepared, with plenty of Oaxaca cheese inside.  The shredded beef taco was large too, with plenty of meat, & delicious.  Another thing was that the attractive presentation on the platter & the hot platter itself were both really nice, like something out of an ad where they took all day to prep & photo it!\n\nThis location looks new, & it's VERY nice inside!  It was cold outside, & I landed a comfortable booth near the fire in the fireplace!  My service, from Alex, was friendly & attentive, too.\n\nThis \""Mex & Match\"" Lunch Special is available Monday through Friday 11-4.  I went with the most expensive combination, 2 main items & 2 sides, & it was $8.49.\n\nA LOT of attention to detail has gone into the layout & decor of this restaurant, as well as to the menu, the  preparation of the food, & the presentation of it.  I think there's enough \""specialness\"" here for this Macayo's to deserve 5 Stars!     :-))"
0,"I grew up going to this hotel and wanted to try and start the same tradition with my family and son.  Boy oh boy has this hotel gone downhill....was so disappointed.  There were many problems:\n\n1.) Check in took 2 effing hours, we didn't get into our room until 2 am\n2.) Be careful, you don't want to sleep on the side where the Cromwell hotel is...their rooftop club will keep you up all night long :(\n3.) This hotel is no longer family friendly, it's more fitted for 21 year olds.\n4.)  Was super sad about their new Go Pool crap, use to be open to all guests, now only 21 and over and more of a club now with super loud, annoying music\n5.)  Families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.\n6.) DO NOT try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere\n7.) The rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job\n8.) Elevators are scary\n9.) The buffet used to be amazing...it's terrible now\n\nI was very disappointed and sad that we will no longer be carrying on the family tradition at this hotel...can't believe I wasted money there.  I wouldn't even stay here if it was just my friends and I, terrible.  So mad my son had to endure this icky hotel."
1,"Giving it 2 stars for convenience and service. The staff is always polite and very efficient, and it's in a great location. Prices are also decent, so if you're craving Greek food then it's adequate. \n\nThe food doesn't go much further than that for me. Maybe it's just when I go, but every time I've been there the food's been less than what I expected and have come to experience from other Kojax locations. If you can get yourself somewhere else, then do so. If not, prepare to be underwhelmed."
3,"My girlfriends brought me here for my birthday lunch.. Food was great.. Margarita's were even better! Especially the Skinny Margarita (which I added GrandMa too and it became a \""somewhat thin\"" Margarita). Lori our bartender was very patient with us.. which was SO needed, as my GF's can be very High Maintenance! Great atmosphere.. we people watched -which is always fun in Vegas.  \n\nThanks for making my birthday lunch a fun time and Thanks Lori for being very attentive and giving us great service!"
0,"First I'd just like to mention that they do not accept the check-in offer any more. Apparently, this offer was from the previous owner. They really need to remove this offer from yelp because it is quite deceiving. Now on to the food; we ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni/sausage & 1/2 chicken/mushroom. The crust was crispy on some pieces & soggy on others. The sauce was a bit bland, it really could use some flavor. The chicken also didn't taste that great. My husband said the pepperoni/sausage was just meh. Overall we didn't really enjoy the pizza. It was pricey & the quality was not that great. So if I were you i'd skip this place and go somewhere else."
0,"This place is awful. They are a tequila bar but don't even offer a cocktail list. They don't even list the price of the house margarita (\""like 11 and change or something\"" when i asked the bartender) in the menu. The food is terrible. This is the only bar in terminal 3. I suggest you get a camomile as a nightcap when trapped in this abysmal terminal."
3,"Went back for CES, and I dont know if i over ate or there was some extra MSG, but i got an immediate stomach ache after the meal. The food tasted excellent however.. so im sticking with 4 stars and a warning to pace yourself, yelpers!"
1,"It wasn't the worst. That's all I have to say about that.\n\nNah, I'll say a few more things...\n\nThe menu is for sure a little over-whelming for a first timer. The salads, which all look really good, are a tad bit too pricey for me. It's lettuce, c'mon peeps. \n\nNow. I had the regular cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger patty was pre-formed (boo) and cooked correctly, but the bun was cold and tough. Me no likey. Nothing about the burger made my mouth water.\n\nI ordered my burger with onion rings. Some people like them thick, some thin. I am on team THIN. Don't get the onion rings here if you like 'em thin. They are over an inch and a half wide with an enormous amount of breading on them. You actually need to cut them to be able to dip them into any sauce.  It's like they cut a whole onion in half and began to drop them into the frying batter. There was so much batter that the onion barely cooked. Gross. \n\nI may give them another chance because my friend Mark B. is a real burger lover and we promised to take him there to try the burgers. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to get blown away by awesomeness. Rather, if you'd like to revisit the leather strap that daddy spanked your buns with as a child, order the onion rings."
2,"A disclaimer before I get to the review.  Since I'm Indian and have lived in India for a number of years, my standards for Indian food are probably higher than most people's.  I rarely go out to eat at Indian restaurants since my mother can beat most of them, even on a bad day (the exception being South Indian food, dosa, vada, idli etc.).\nNow that that's over, I'll say that Tamarind is about as good as most other Indian places in America, A-OK.  We had the Goat Biryani, the Dahi Paapdi, Andhra Spicy Dosa, Non-Veg Tandoori platter, and garlic naan.\nThe goat biryani wasn't what we were expecting.  And since I've lived in Hyderabad and visited Lucknow a number of times, I think I have a pretty good idea of what biryani is.  It had way too much green chili and pudina.  The Dahi Paapdi just wasn't that flavorful at all.  The dosa and tandoori platter, on the other hand, were both good.   The sambar, idli and gunpowder were on par with spots like Sarvana Bhavan (in America).  The tandoori platter was generously portioned and perfectly seasoned.  Finally, the garlic naan was great (one of the best I've ever had).  Piping hot, slathered in butter with exactly the right amount of garlic.\nIf your standards for Indian food aren't super high, Tamrind definitely won't disappoint."
1,The ride itself was lovely.  The preparation before the ride was atrocious.
4,"To start off,  the pizza  AMAZING!  We had the spicy italian one and it was soooo good!  We need to try a few other pizzas there. We dined  at v's taproom (formerly known as verde grill) last Wednesday and had a great experience. The service was definitely up to par and the ambiance was perfect.  The restaurant overlooks the golf course. I also recommend the  crispy brussels sprouts to start with.  I'm not even a big fan  of Brussels sprouts and these were for sure worth having again! Overall try V's Taproom! I will definitely be back"
2,"I had a great time on my last trip to Vegas - however I think it was more thanks to the Patron than the Hard Rock. \n\nLikes: \nThe pool - great vibe if you want to drink and dance in the pool. Not great if you want to relax and sunbathe. The music is loud and the people are all over the place. \n\nThe overall vibe: Very young vibe in the hotel. Guest are typically in their 20-30s and all have the same party attitude. Makes for a fun scene when you all are on the same page. \n\nVery comfortable bed! \n\nHotel Service: I see some complaints about the service but I had a great experience. I had a gift sent to a room and the woman was very accommodating to my particular situation. The servers were very friendly and one waitress even gave our party of 8 a round of shots on the house. \n\nMusic - Wasted Space, Vanity and Rehab all played a great mix of dancing music.  \n\nDislikes:\n2 people per room get in free - the rest have to pay $20. Its worth it but is still a super lame policy. Plus they screen you better than TSA. The female security checked under my boobs before I entered. Wow. \n\nThe room has a big mirror in the bathroom and a few mirrors on the bathroom door but only 1 outlet. Not the best set up if you are planning a girls trip and want to all get ready together. \n\nBartender Service: At Wasted Space I ordered a cranberry vodka and basically got a glass of cranberry juice. I asked for a little splash more of vodka but the bartender said I would have to pay for an entire new drink. Then at Vanity I ordered 2 shots of Parton, about 15 minutes apart. I was charged $16 for one and $25 for the other - the EXACT same drink. These were my first two drinks of the evening so I was not drunk and over tipping. These people overcharged me and will not respond to my inquiries about why. \n\nOverall I would return to the Hard Rock. I had so much fun drinking and dancing that the several complaints I had were worth my stay."
0,"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat."
4,"Just what you'd expect from this staple in the sub business, but friendlier than any I've seen before. Maybe that's because it's not on a college campus. Either way - 5 stars it is!"
1,"To Sedona's Credit,  the GM contacted me via e-mail to rectify the situation.  I promptly responded, but have not heard from her since.  I assured her I would try this establishment another time and update the review based on that visit.\n\nI sincerely hope the email was not just to get a ratings boost.  Time will tell...\n\n\n\n\nThis really pains me, but I can't give Sedona more than 1 star!  I see a lot of other decent reviews, but that simply wasn't my experience here.  \n\nAfter driving by no less than 100 times, I finally decided to take advantage of the $19.99 Steak and Lobster special.  This is my weakness and I had previously never met a Lobster I didn't like!  \n\nUpon entering, I was struck by a feeling of attempted class.  I say attempted because the walls are really quite bare, but the decor that they do have is not cheap.  The lighting is reduced and the furnishings are on the more upscale side, but something just doesn't feel right.  I walk up to the bar, primarily because it is wide open, take a seat and prepare to ask for a menu and begin the \""what Vodka do you have\"" game.  I am immediately greeted by a bartender in a classy (from the front) black dress and told \""If you aren't gambling, you can't sit there\"".  Now, call me crazy, but I am more accustomed to \""Hi, how are you today?\"" or... God forbid from a place ATTEMPTING class \""Good evening, Sir.  What can I get you?\"".  My expectations were obviously high... after all, this IS the place with the discount steak and lobster.  Being no stranger to a video poker machine, the only civil response I could muster was a curt smile as I inserted money into the machine and ordered my drink.  As the bartender turns away, I notice that the once \""classy\"" dress is has an open back and she has a freaking mural tattooed on her back.  Nothing against tattoo's, but this is a FAIL!\n\nAfter about 20 minutes and setting off half a dozen flares to get the bartenders attention, I ordered my food.  In the interests of time and YOUR boredom, I will skip to the point and say that most of the 25-30 minutes that I was waiting for my food, most all of the staff (I think even the cook - he certainly wasn't a 'chef') were gathered around the service area discussing their weekends.  Another FAIL on the class front.\n\nFood is here-  A firm believer that there is no other way to eat a steak than medium-rare, my cow is cooked to baseball mitt levels.  The seasoning was non-existent and the presentation was sloppy (sorry, didn't think to take pictures at the time as I was busy downing TUMS). The lobster was rubbery, obviously over-cooked.  By far the most edible item on my plate were the veggies, as I had to send the potatoe back for another microwave session.\n\nI will not be back here, which is really disappointing because I keep getting text messages and email offers from the apparently mandatory players club card I signed up for (skipped that part, but it was entertaining).   Sorry Sedona!"
4,"Ok, so I'd be repeating my review of the camelback and 67th ave location.  Ditto for Roosevelt and 16th st and southern and central. They are great! And new owners have done plenty to improve the locations! During the chilly evenings I recommend the champurrado. It's made different here than what I'm used to but it's delicious on its own right."
3,"We came during Happy Hour, and it was the cheapest meal we had in Vegas. I had the Viva Las Vegas Roll, and was stuffed. That thing is heavy duty.\n\nBoyfriend had the crispy tuna roll and the spicy yellowtail roll. That crispy tuna roll is amazing. It was my favorite. The spicy yellowtail...good, but not spicy at all. \n\nWe also had the pineapple cream cheese wontons, and they were gross. But our waitress took them off the bill immediately when we handed back the plate with all but one wonton. \n\nOf course this place isn't traditional, just take a look at it! But it was fun, cheap, yummy and made for great people watching."
4,"First of, to compare this venue with the theater of one of the Cirque du solei shows makes no sense! Those are in the newer hotels with ticket prices that are a lot higher than those for Illusions. I was actually impressed with the room Jan Rouven had his show in because I expected less, knowing it was in the Riviera....\n\nI used to dance as a teen so I was able to value the dancers knowing that what they performed was truely difficult although it looked easy( which it always does when something is done well).\n\nHis magic tricks were amazing- each one of them and made us wonder how in the world he did that. Jan is funny and quite handsome which lead to an evening filled with laughter, wonder and great memories.\n\nAt the end of his show he took time to take pictures and talk with everyone who wanted to do so."
1,"The Beehive was hands down my favorite coffee shop in college. That's certainly not the case anymore.\n\nBack in 2006-2008, there were three spacious rooms to sit in, eclectic furniture and art on sale, a great mix customers, with older locals alongside college kids, and reliable Internet access. It was a go-to place whenever a few friends and I needed to get school work done. We'd sprawl across a table with our laptops, sipping on coffee and picking up snacks.\n\nI can't see it being a really effective study place now.\n\nThe quirky decor hasn't changed, but a lot else has. Two of the three rooms that were used for seating were closed off, so that a bar could take its place. (As if there weren't enough bars on East Carson Street.) The remaining room is very long and narrow, and feels crowded. The decor, which has always had 90's bohemian feel, just seems kind of dated. They've also gotten a liquor license, which I think brings in the wrong kind of crowd for a coffee shop.\n\nOf course, a place like this should really be rated on the coffee and food, but my two visits there this year were sub par.\n\nOne of those times I got a veggie hummus sandwich that was pre-wrapped on display in the fridge, but it was squished and didn't taste very fresh. The other time I got an iced coffee, which I immediately regretted buying as soon as I took a sip. It was extremely watery and had a peculiar aftertaste. I wished I had just gotten a drink from Starbucks or Big Dog Coffee on Sarah Street instead."
3,"After hunting high and low for a parking space (where do people find places to park near this area of Uptown Waterloo?!) - I walked into My-Thai just 40 minutes before closing.\n\nI had set my heart on Thai food, and chose this place after reading the Yelp reviews. However, if I wasn't so determined to try this place, and also wasn't starving after a long work day, I may have been turned off by the 'we're closing soon' comment from the waitress (and disdained look I got when I said I knew, and would be quick since I was dining solo).\n\nHowever, from there out, the food was so great I overlooked the rushed service. And the waitress' attitude did get a bit better...\n\nI ordered the Thai rolls to start - it's not often that places go wrong with fried spring rolls, and My Thai certainly didn't. They were excellent, and I really liked the chicken filling. I also got the My-Thai cocktail, which was vodka, mango and cranberry juice. Yummy! For my entree, I debated about being more adventurous, but couldn't ignore the nagging feeling that I needed to order the Emerald Chicken Curry - and holy smokes, I'm glad I listened to my instincts! The coconut curry sauce was magnificent, and had just the right amount of spice. There were a plethora of delicious, perfectly cooked vegetables (snow peas, green beans, baby corn, carrots, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower...phew!) alongside lovely tender pieces of chicken. Best green curry I've ever had. Hands down.\n\nAnd best of all, it is affordable too. \n\nI will be back on a future visit to Waterloo. Definitely."
2,"When Mr. Chicken first opened it struggled with how busy it got and that resulted in some lengthy wait times. The food that I have tried (5-6 times) has always been good. Mr. Chicken is wavering on that fine line between either improving and becoming a long-term staple, or digressing and becoming an afterthought.\n\nI'd strongly suggest more counter help. One person working the front, back, drive through, taking orders, bagging food, and working the register just doesn't cut it.\n\nFingers crossed for improvements."
0,"Unless you love the smell of mold, urine, and tons of Lysol burning your sinus. Never never stay here. There are defiantly no cozy feelings here, more like the feeling of a crusty old apartment that's been rented out to crack heads who own dogs. Trust me, I had to stay at the comfort inn when i got in at 130 this morning because i could not check in early here. The inn is no palace but is at least comfortable and doesn't smell horrific. Whatever i guess this is my happy home for the next ten days but I'm not sure if i can hack it."
0,Booked my car in advance online at a rate of $46-when asked if I wanted any extras I said NO TO EVERYTHING. When I returned the car I noticed I was billed an additional $10 + tax for roadside service I DID NOT REQUEST. I was told to go see customer service. The young lady there assured me I would be credited for the extra $. When I got my credit card bill I was billed for the full charges-$59. You cannot get in touch with anyone from the car rental-they do not answer their phone-voice mailboxes are full and won't accept messages.  No extensions have live people-I tried them all. I even called the general 800# to complain and got no one who could help me. DO  NOT USE THIS CAR RENTAL OR IF YOU DO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET CHARGED FOR ANY HIDDEN ITEMS AND DEMAND CREDIT RIGHT THERE AND THEN OR GET SOMETHING IN WRITING IF THEY DO OVERCHARGE YOU.
1,"Yes, I've DEFINITELY experienced better! I understand the party scene and casinos are important features of this hotel as with everywhere else in Vegas, but so should the service and overall quality of amenities. How does The Palms stand up to others within the field of hospitality?  It is as dated as Hugh Hefner. I felt like the front desk employee was speaking to me like I was James Bond (thank you, but this pad doesn't exactly scream high profile sir), and it simply falls short when it comes to meeting the expectations they create for themselves.  They will automatically place you in a room with one king-size bed and if you need 2 doubles, they will charge you extra! There is also some weird \""room service fee\"" that I was not informed about and that is completely unnecessary if all you're doing is sleeping there, and you will be charged an additional \""resort fee.\"" I began to wonder if I was booking a flight or staying at a hotel at this point and I realized I should have just used all that money to stay at a nicer place on the strip where there is an actual lobby."
2,"A little smaller and less helpful than most apple stores.  They also didn't have inventory advertised on the apple store online (and were confused about what they did have, even though they have a smaller inventory to keep track of). \n\nVery very difficult to get service at all here, even on a very non-busy weekend night before closing.  Strange."
2,How many of you like to eat portions that are bigger than yo head? Me me me meeeeeee! Well ladies and gents gather here and get the biggest bang for your buck at Vegas! Take it from me order one dish and share it with a pal. Food was good but not awesome.  The spectacle of the portions really overshadows the taste.
1,"Average food.  Sorry I can't give a better rating.  Service was excellent.  Waitress was friendly.  All other open kitchen staff coming and going never acknowledged the customers.  Sandwich had wilted, nearly slimy lettuce.  Meat was lean but bland. The person that made the sandwich knows exactly how unfresh the sandwich content was."
4,"Blue Dust ALWAYS has good beers. They have a great selection of infused vodkas. My husband is a beer expert and he lives to come here to see what they have in tap and to make a 6 pack. \nTheir food is definitely not your typical bar food. They have seasonal items on their menus as well as their regular dishes. For example they are offering pumpkin hummus as well as Fisherman's Stew during these falling temperatures. One of my favorite dishes is their version of \""surf and turf\"". It is done as two halves of sandwiches-one half being crab cake and the other being brisket. There is very little filler in the crab cakes and the brisket is very tasty. Their homemade salsa is really good too. \nTry it!!!  Great beer and great food!"
2,"I went to this location of In n Out last night aaaaat about 1:30 am. Yes, I had had some beverages. That alone should have made this experience extra delicious....but it wasn't. There was a long line, understandable. When we got our food (I got a cheeseburger animal style, BF got a double double) it wasn't up to my expectations for In n Out. The bun didn't have that little bit of crispness that I've experienced at other locations, the tomato was mealy, and they skimped on the onions. Next time I have had some beverages and am craving In n out (which is a seldom occurrence) I might keep driving to the Mesa location, which I have had better experiences at."
3,"This totally reminds me of being back home in Hawaii!  They even have fruit punch!  Prices are pretty cheap, and the servings are HUGE!!!  They have tons of local favorites.  They even have furikake...you just have to ask.  They give 1 free refill per drink order.  \n\nmy group has ordered the loco moco, spam eggs rice, garlic chicken with gravy, korean combo (chicken & beef), spam musubi, fruit punch...all DELISH!  The only thing that wasn't all that was the beef in the korean combo.  It was a little on the tough side.  the mac salad is so good!!!\n\nThis place is cash only.  Don't forget to tip the servers.  Be prepared to be surrounded by all local folks.  Highchairs are a little on the dirty side.  Take-out supplies are conveniently located near the tables for self-service.  =)  I always come here every time I'm in LV."
0,"I've been craving breadsticks since I picked up some from Target. (Pizzahut breadsticks) (they're so good!)\nAnyways ,So this is right by where we live, I ordered the howie bread. \nIt's so chewy,not like jets doughy that you can actually chew , this is like chewing a piece of rubber. \nWhatever seasoning they put on top it has no flavor whatsoever with a hint of bitter.\nI couldn't eat it after the first piece.\nBland $5 of waste!"
4,"Always fast service and good food ! I love this place . I come here maybe 4 times a month and the ladies here always friendly. The lemonade is to die for. Try all there chicken rice dishes of my godddd delicious . I'm eating some orange chicken as I'm trying this !!!! I feel like Imma food coma. That's how good this place is every time I leave. The nose you'll spend for 2 is like 20 bux. Try it out, won't be dissappointed"
3,"I would give it 5 stars but it nearly put a hole in my pocket ($40/person). It was my bad since I didn't look at the price menu before walking in BUTI left SA-TIS-FIED! When I was working in Vegas, I discovered this spot one night when a friend and I were just feeling some Mediterranean food.\n\nIt was a six course meal that left me wanting more and more and more....MMmmm the Shrimp Scampi were delish! The game hen was so tender and savory, the meat just fell right of the bones and into my salivating mouth. The hummus with veggies were also to die for. The belly dancer were entertaining as well. \n\nI only wish that they had lunch specials or something for half price during the day, you know without all the oohhs and ahhhs, entertainment, and fancy shamancy shiet. I'm selfish. I know. I just want to be able to afford you in this economic crisis...."
2,"Definitely not my favorite theater to see a show in. If you get a seat in the middle good luck if you need to get up and use the bathroom, and once you get to a bathroom expect a long wait. Aside from all that, it is a historical building and the shows they bring in are a lot of fun."
3,"Plain and simple, this location has never messed up my order.  \nThey are quick, they are friendly, and they are clean.\n\nThis location is super close to work, so I'm here frequently.  \n\nthey have a great selection on their \""value\"" menu...\n\nOh and I LOVE the new fries!!!"
0,"I will never order flowers through Cactus Flowers again.  I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?\n\nSo on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.  It actually takes effort to suck as much as they do.  \n\nMoral of this story:  Do not use Cactus Flowers.  I will return to using Pro Flowers as I have never had any issues with them."
2,"*Warning*\nDO NOT fight with a friend in line because the bouncers will kick you out before you even get in.\n\nI loved the view from the tables by the windows and the patio outside! \n\nOther than that, the club is pretty standard...same ol Vegas style mix of music, same type of people, same type of drinks, etc."
3,"Found out about this place via a friend of mine, the folks that own the place are her neighbors and they are no joke legit Italians from Italy. I went to their grand opening and had one of the pizza's, it was tasty! The crust was nice and thin and crispy and there was a good amount of everything as far as sauce, toppings and cheese go. The sauce was super flavorful and had the right amount of spice to it. If I lived closer to this place it would be my regular pizza spot but it's a bit of a trek from where I am. However if I find myself in that part of town you bet i'll be stopping in!"
2,"Popped in here awhile back, watched a decent local band do classic rock for about :30 min. It was pretty empty for a Friday night (the place is deceptively bigger than it looks from outside). Mostly older, rougher crowd, they mostly felt like neighborhood regulars. \n\nDrinks were cheap (why they get three stars).\n\nKinda dingy atmosphere in here, felt old and tired. With a face lift and some hope, perhaps the OBR can rise again... you let me know...."
0,"Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \""the list\"".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue."
3,"Location! Location! Location! \nFlamingo is in the heart of the strip. I can honestly say it's one of my favorite hotels in Vegas -- Mainly because of the Go Rooms and the location. \n\nCheck-in to the hotel can take a while (depending on what time you arrive) but with a drink in my hand I don't mind ;-) \n\nKeep in mind that Flamingo is renovated and it doesn't look as bad as it looks from the outside. I will admit, when I first stayed at Flamingo with some friends I was a little skeptical. But since I was on a budget, I didn't care. The deluxe room is just ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. \nNow, the Go deluxe room is a whole different story. It is a little pricier but I think it's worth it. It's very pink. Yet, I'm not a fan of pink but I kinda liked this pink.....weird I know. The Go deluxe rooms are funky. Love the decor and the TV in the bathroom...how awesome is that! Love the 42-inch TV in the room. The bed was very comfortable and just a cool room. \n\nThe pool is just too much fun. They have a slide that I went on over and over again. The pool is very big and it did get a little crowded at times. \n\nThis place is awesome! I try to never stay at the same place twice, but this hotel is just too cool."
2,This is small sports bar/restaurant hole in the wall place and it's very relaxed. The seafood is very good. The only really bad thing about this place is the prices. That's the only reason I don't come here more often.
0,"Well, I went there earlier tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and soft taco. He ordered the #6 combo, which is the beef chalupa w/a hardshell taco. The inside of my quesadilla was cold and barely had any chicken in it. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend's chalupas had barely any meat in the inside and it was the same for his hardshell taco. I would expect better service and better preparation. We waited an awfully long time about 15 minutes. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The Taco Bell on East Washington is far better."
0,"They delivered damaged furniture twice... We had to take the days off twice and had guests coming over and had no furniture... They brought brown leather couches that were scraped and peeling. They even put the legs on one of the couches backwards. I was told by the delivery manager Mark that they could not do anything or transfer me to their general manager. Their GM Bob Anderson called to follow up and did nothing to resolve it. I did get credited for the items. However, they did not credit me the delivery charge which is completely wrong!! I am waiting for a follow up and I expect the delivery charge to be refunded. I will update this post after they follow up with me. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY ELSEWHERE OR ONLINE!!! THIS COMPANY DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS AND CANNOT DELIVER ITEMS IN THE SAME QUALITY THAT THEY ARE DISPLAYED IN THE STORE!!!!!"
2,"I stayed at the Hampton Inn on my recent visit to UIUC. I picked the place because of its convenient location, just a few steps from campus. Overall, I was pretty happy with the place: the rooms as nothing fancy, but they're clean enough, and a big plus: the whole hotel has free wireless internet (I hate having to pay $10 a day to go online as you do at most nicer hotels). Continental breakfast is also included, and they have a fitness room/pool (which I didn't get a chance to try). My two only complaints: the water pressure was really low in the shower. Also, it could be a little cheaper: I paid $139 a night for a standard room... a little more than I would have liked considering the quality of the rooms (although as I understand, if you are a UIUC employee, the rate is $89 a night). Nothing to write home about, but not a terrible place either."
4,Great food. I come here all the time and always get steak kabobs. The sauce on the kabobs is very good. Lots of healthy menu choices but you still get good potions for the price. Fast and very clean restaurant.
2,"I was happy to find this place while on vacation in Arizona and spending the night outside of Phoenix. Is this the best Thai food I've ever had? No, but it was still very good! The pad Thai was yummy, and the spice was just right. If you're a spiceaholic, the Thai hot may not be quite hot enough for you though. My friend got the yummy duck curry. The curry  was delicious but the duck itself close to inedible due to bone and gristle. For the price though, I'm not surprised. Who can afford to waste duck these days?"
0,"I have never been as insulted as I was last  night when my party and I were refused service at Cornish Pasty Company. We sat outside without being approached for 20 minutes, after being told at the door that we could sit anywhere. I finally got up to ask someone for menus, and was told by a male server that he would bring them out. He then proceeded to move in and out, making eye contact with me numerous times, without greeting our table. After 10 more minutes of waiting, a female server asked if we had been helped. We said no, and she said that she would send someone out. 15 minutes later, and we still hadn't been approached. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else. I can't believe that we were ignored for so long on a busy patio that had at least 3 different servers moving around. We have eaten here numerous times in the past, but will never go back again."
2,"This Thai restaurant greeted me with French songs, how romantically irrelevant. Maybe they're going for a more \""date night\"" feel. With such a humorously kinky name, it's a shame that the restaurant is tucked away towards the inner streets of Southside, instead of along the main Carson stretch. If it wasn't for Yelp, I don't think I'll ever discover this place. The restaurant is clean and bright with good service. \n\n As for food, I thought it was pretty average. I ordered the Pineapple Curry Bowl, which is more on the sweeter side of the curry spectrum. It was creamy, soupy and slightly tangy. For a curry bowl, I was not satisfied with the spice level. Kind of disappointed that the waitress did not give me the option to alter that. My eating companions ordered two different noodle dishes, but they both ended up tasting exactly the same, just different noodles. The food took forever to come out, but ended up a bit too cold for my liking. I like my food steamy if I have to wait that long. Portions are average and can easily be finished in one sitting. Prices are double digits $$, but not too bad. I think it's a great place for a date night if you bring your own booze. \n\nOverall, I thought the food at Thai Me Up was just okay, not the best ever. I feel like it's more of a fusion restaurant so I would recommend this place to my fellow foodies who are a bit more shy. If you're adventurous with thrill seeking taste buds, I don't think this place will satisfy that wild side."
3,"Chen's, probably the best Chinese food on campus. \n\nI usually order the chicken shanghai noodles which is quite good. It's probably the sauce they put in it , but it keeps bringing me back. For plaza food, its also a decent price of around $8 for a good amount of food. \n\nThey also have free bubble tea after 5pm - it's not the greatest but hey, it's free."
2,"Not every meal in Vegas is going to be over the top. Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat after laying by the pool all day. \n\nBonanno's is located at the Food Court in the District. It is convenient to the MGM Pool Complex. Also, they are open late(maybe 24 hours? They do serve breakfast)\n\nJust had a quick slice of pizza, but it was delicious, cheap, and quick. Exactly what I was looking for. Great option for a late night snack too since most places in the area stop serving food around Midnight."
4,"I LOVE Marks and Spencers food. The melt in mouth chocolate cookies, the delicious range of sandwiches, the crisp vegetable pizzas and not forgetting Percy Pigs!\n\nThis is an excellent branch on Marks & Sparks simply food, it's huge so has an excellent selection but the only downside is that it can get ridiculously busy due to it's prime location on Princes Street but I don't let that put me off venturing in. Nothing keeps me away from my Percy Pigs, not even 10 mile long queues.\n\nIf there's one thing I spend a lot of money on, it's food. Eating is my favourite thing to do and I just can't resist the goodness of trusty old Markies! \n\nI was doing a bit of shopping in nearby Topshop and was getting a little bit tired out, it's hard work being a shopaholic you know! So, I decided to head along to Simply Food for a bite to eat. I had a hankering for their delicious chicken cous cous salad box with pumpkin, green beans and balsamic vinegar dressing. I made a bee-line for the sandwiches section and snatched up a box of my favourite salad. I couldn't resist browsing the sandwiches and ended up getting a salmon and cream cheese sarnie too. Once I'd grabbed a juice box and a cookie I was on my merry way to the checkout.\n\nAs I was leaving I noticed that this huge branch of Simply Foods has it's very own cafe so I perched down and started gorging on my reasonably large lunch. Absolutely delicious."
2,"There is not a whole lot of Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants that I know of that isn't too far from the strip but thanks to Yelp I was able to enjoy dinner with some buddies.\n\nI had their Baba Ganoush and Falafel plater. I thought the food were remarkable. I wish the salad came in a little bigger portion, and besides the chick server and the boss in the back kitchen I find it hard to believe that this is 100% authentic..\n\nGood service, good food, and reasonably priced nonetheless."
1,Food took a while it was at night I was looking at apartments on that street all the way up the street but this is the only McDonalds in the vicinity and there's no other real restaurant in for a mile or two going up to Henderson
0,The food delivered from this restaurant was very close to in inedible. A complete waste of money. Never again!
2,"Good fast food mexican place close to the office. Attached to a Sinclair gas station so filler up, car wash and mexican dinner! 3 for 1 as I call it!"
4,"I've been to a lot of sushi places in Vegas but Spicy Tuna really stands out. The nigiri sushi at Spicy Tuna has always been really flavorful and fresh. All of the rolls are really good and creative, my wife really loves the Birthday Special roll which doesn't look very easy to make but tastes really good. None of the sushi that I've tried here tasted bland which is \nthe problem at a lot of sushi places in the valley. \n\nThe service is great and very attentive, we usually sit at the sushi bar so I couldn't tell you what it's like to order sushi from a table."
4,"Love this place! My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary. Everything from the food the staff, the scenery even the amenities are top notch. Highly recommended!"
4,"Dear Monty's,\n\nI miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with \""World's Best Coffee\"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. \n\nFor years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. \n\nFor all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing like it anywhere else.\n\nSincerely,\nAngelina"
4,"I have had the chance to visit Mastro's Ocean Club twice and both times were equally wonderful. Everything from the wait staff, ambiance and the food are all beyond amazing. \n\nTheir service is probably as good as it gets. The hostesses are all very friendly in their greetings when you arrive. The wait staff is very attentive. I felt like I never had to flag someone down, there was always someone readily available. \n\nThe energy in the restaurant is very nice. There was live music being played on a piano which helped to set the tone. The restaurant itself is set up in a modern tree house space located inside of the Crystal's shopping center. There is nice colorful lighting that helps set off the dark woods of the tree house and white table cloths of Mastro's.\n\nThe food though is the real star of the show. I had the 12oz filet and it was phenomenal. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. Perfectly seasoned. The other member of my party had the bone in rib eye which was just massive. The sides we ordered were more than enough to share. The side portions are a meal in themselves. Their mac & cheese is a must have! So are their sea salt & vinegar fries. If possible, save room for dessert. Their signature butter cake is by far one of the best desserts that I have ever had on the Las Vegas strip. I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary cake from the manager, so if I could, they would get an extra bonus star just for that.\n\nAll in all, Mastro's is a definite must visit. It's great for special occasions or even business dinners. It will become one of your new standards for what you expect in a restaurant."
1,"Another mediocre Indian restaurant, mediocre food, mediocre service at mediocre prices. Some days can be less than mediocre. If you're craving some specific dish, and your drew lots for this, I guess it's okay. I am not sure anyone would choose to go here. \nMEH!"
4,Good company. Fair prices and quality work. Enough said!
4,"I seemed to be getting lured into JoAnns regularly of late.  I have several friends who are crafters who want to just stop by when we are in the neighborhood...\n\nI am amazed.  They have everything.  Whatever you want to make, I'd bet they have the stuff for it.  Just walking through the aisles I thought of 4,876 different things that *I* could make with ease because of the wonderful goodies they had.\n\nOf course, I know I won't sit down and make anything.  I don't have the patience to learn how to thread a sewing machine...maybe if someone gave me a self-threading one, I'd think about it.  Maybe.\n\n....but with all the crafty goodness of JoAnns...I COULD.  And a store that makes you believe, well that's Disneyriffic!"
1,"I was looking forward to a show in Vegas. We were staying at the Stratosphere so we did receive discount tickets (if I had paid full price I would have been fully ripped off). The headliner Clair SinClair....has a nice speaking voice perhaps her next gig will be to replace Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, she is pretty but her part in the show is minimal at best. Her speaking parts left the audience wondering why she was speaking. The dancers are good and the singer is good for most of the numbers but some were hard on the ears. The band is very good, we would have rather listened to them.\n\nOne of the people in our party even fell asleep that is how good the show was. We stayed thinking it would get better, it really didn't. The first half is definitely better...so if you want to leave do so by June it is pretty much down hill from there.  \n\n The show is a run through Claire's pin up calendar.... longest year of our lives! We were eagerly awaiting Christmas but it never came. \n\nIf you want entertainment at the Stratosphere go see Frankie Moreno.... that show EVERYONE ENJOYED!"
4,Ahh the pride and joy of Pittsburgh. Make sure you stop here before leaving Pittsburgh. As the old tale goes steel workers used to come here on lunch break for a quick lunch. Often they didn't have time to eat a side of coleslaw and fries seperately so they just threw it on the sandwich. And thank God they did. A truly unique experience. Don't ask for them on the side or you'll look like a complete idiot. If the waitress doesn't refuse I will come myself and throw the fries on the sandwich. A great icon for the city of Pittsburgh and a great value
1,"I would honestly give 2 1/2 stars if possible and here is why.\n1.Parking is crazy. Once you park you have to back out of the lane because there is only one way to go.\n2. List 3 haunted houses but honestly 2 1/2 and that is stretching it. The Maze part (Chaos)  at the end is not worth the wait- and you have to wait in line even if you have a fast pass which we had. \nThe props in the first and best attraction was  \n\""The crypt\"" and worth a visit. I would have them expand that haunted house and ditch the other two.\nIf you want to try it go with the Fast pass."
4,"I don't get to this place nearly as often as I would like to since I live near UNLV and this place is on west Sahara and I'm a non driver so I need to go with somebody who has a car and I don't relish the thought of taking 4 buses (round trip). I went there with a friend yesterday.We've both been there before and I've eaten here on at least 10 or more previous occasions.I always enjoy the food TREMENDOUSLY here.They have a pretty decent variety and the food is very fresh and extremely tasty.I probably end up eating more here than just about any other Chinese buffet I go to.The manager (Daniel) and staff are extremely friendly and personable.\n         Some of my favorite items include cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce). I really like this and most Chinese buffets do not have this.I would also recommend their garlic shrimp(extremely delicious flavor),pepper steak(tender),steamed fish,teriyaki chicken and a variety of other items you may like depending on your tastes and preferences.Their sushi selection is average,not bad but not spectacular,but to tell the truth,I enjoy the regular dishes so much that I rarely eat the sushi.\n        Buffet Asia used to be my preferred Chinese buffet but Krazy Buffet has definitely replaced it as my favorite.My comments are based on the lunch buffet.You can go to the dinner buffet for about four dollars more but I haven't done that yet.I assume they might have a few extra items but I'm more than satisfied with the lunch selection.If you go to their web site,they have some coupons that you can print which will give you either a 10% or 15% discount depending on what time of day you go there.\n       In closing,I truly recommend to anyone that is reading this review that you pay at least one visit to this place.If you do,I think you will go back again.I would come here at least once a week if they were closer to where I live.Try it.If you like it,post here and let us know."
3,"Squirrel Hill classic!!! \n\nIt really is excellent pizza and the sauce is so perfect! The dining area isn't anything to write home about - but the pizza is, so its all balanced!"
2,Had high expectations... Food was just average... Charge too much for what you get. Tables are way too close together. It is way too loud inside. You can't hear yourself think.... I will not be coming here again!
0,"I 110% agree with Elysia. I also work in the mall and my coworkers and I have been to Johnny Rockets a bunch of times combined. \n\nI can say that I have had one semi-decent experience out of ten. The customer service is HORRIBLE! I always order the veggie patty and twice they messed that up... I call in all of my orders and being placed on hold means listening to the hostess take other peoples orders while the phone sits on the counter. Shortest amount of time you'll wait is 5 minutes, so you'll want to hang up and call back later. The staff always seem to be in a bad mood, their is no sense of urgency, and very disorganized... come on! it's a burger joint! And they dance?!?! \n\nLast thing I will say is considering my coworkers and I used to always order from Johnny Rockets, you would think they would remember at least one of us and not look at us like complete strangers when we go to pickup our order. \n\nThe sad thing is, I love Johnny Rockets, but will not be returning to this location. I will take my $13 else where..."
0,"I was very excited to stay at here being an architectural fan. I did love the building and the grounds.\n\nHowever, the service and overall stay was horrible from start to finish. This started with the bell service who forgot to bring my bags to my room. After they pointed me in the wrong direction for parking the car and walking back to the lobby in 100 plus degree heat to check in I had to walk back to the bell desk out front to ask them to bring my bags up after they never showed up in my room. The room was hot and the AC turned up full blast was completely inadequate. The shower somehow only got extremly hot water, which is not fun when the AC doesn't work. Later that night, before going out to dinner, I put a card out for breakfast in the morning. When we returned from diner I noticed the card had not been picked up. I went to the lobby to tell the front desk. The front desk took my room number and insiste they would send someone right up to get it and not to worry because my breakfast would be there in the morning. When we woke up the card was still on the door and no breakfast was delivered. \n\nAlthough the grounds and building are beatiful you don't need to stay here to see that. I was so excited to stay here and in the end I couldn't wait to leave. HORRIBLE!"
0,"Not satisfied, service was poor and could tell the host was lying to us.\nWe ordered \""dual-shrimp and chicken fried rice\"" and  \""beef pan fried noodles\"".\n \nThe beef wasnt all to bad, but nothing to get excited over.\nNot sure if our other dish even had shrimp in it with small bits of chicken here and there, not worth the price for that dish what so ever. \n\nThis place is right up the street from chinatown. Go there instead."
0,"I have literally never had a worse experience at a nail salon in my life. Although their salon is clean and well kept their customer service was terrible. \n\nThey have a television on the wall that you can watch while you're getting your nails done. While getting my pedicure the lady who was painting my nails repeatedly turned around (for minutes at a time) to watch show. The show playing was ridiculousness, the annoying one with Rob Dyrdek, which is reason in itself to lower a star or two (does anybody actually like that show??) Anyway, she kept laughing hysterically and extremely loudly and saying \""oh my gosh that's f**king crazy!\"" I KID YOU NOT. I was like is this last really cursing right now?? So unprofessional. I came right when they opened so we were the only ones in the salon at the time but I still felt really awkward and annoyed. It also took substantially longer than expected because she kept turning around to watch the show. \n\nBeside the bad customer service, the chairs they do the pedicures in are really uncomfortable (not your typical spa chair) and my polish chipped 2 days later. It wasn't worth going back to have them fix it. I wouldn't recommend this salon to ANYONE. Worst one I've been to in vegas so far."
3,We come here often something different then the same old food expanded my belt lol good fast food
3,Wine bar with monitors displaying departures.\nCheck.\n\nRocking chairs scattered throughout the terminals.\nCheck.\n\nGelato stand\nCheck.\n\nSpa services while you wait for your flight.\nCheck.\n\nI may just move in.
0,"Bar Smith has great sandwiches for lunch, and a nice rooftop bar open most evenings. Be warned, the place smells like a raw sewer burst open. Hang out for about 15 minutes, and your nose will get used to it and stop noticing. There really isn't anything special about the place, but everything is good. I always have had my eyes on the enormous bottles of grey goose above the bar.\n\nUPDATE - 6-20-08:\n\nWent in last friday to meet up with a friend. He had been there since 4:30 in the afternoon, and now it was 10pm so as you can imagine he was too drunk to really know his surroundings. I walked up and they were frisking everyone who went through the door, and took one look at me and said go ahead... lol. The girl tried to charge me a cover, which I denied and went ahead and went in anyway, as I was not planning on staying longer than what it took to get my buddy out of there. I went in and it was a friggin thug fest. Every Cholo, Ese, and Heina in Phoenix was there. I was the only white guy in the place. It felt very unsafe, even for a guy who grew up in the hood. I will never go back there as long as they are advertising to and accepting this type of clientele. It's unsafe, unsophisticated, and downright embarrasing. \n\nONE STAR!"
2,"I can only vouch for the rides, and they were the best part of my last trip to Vegas.  Suffice it to say that my last trip to Vegas will not make it onto my BEST VACATIONS list, but it was fun nonetheless, if not outrageously overpriced."
1,"The food was satisfactory, but definitely NOT worth the price. I had to wait forever, and it wasn't that busy at the time, either. The service could have been a lot better."
0,"We went here for a bachelor party last summer, and we heard this place was the best.  Well, actually, it was the worst.   And I can't say any strip club in montreal for that matter really blew us away, but this place took the cake for most over-hyped, underwhelming, shoebox strip club award.  They crammed us together in a awkward rectangle, provided little to no service, and there were about 3 girls for the 150 dorks sitting around.  Yes we were definitely inclusive in that dork population, but man... this place just hurt.  Funny how they made us wait online outside behind the velvet rope like we were entering the Ultimate paradise!"
4,"Our favorite dive Chinese restaurant.  Whenever we are back in Phx we go here.  Why?\n\n1.  The best crab puffs on the planet\n2.  The best fried rice that we have ever had!\n3.  Sweet and sour sauce that they make on site, SOOO good.\n4.  Never had anything that wasn't really good, really hot, and portions are extremely generous.\n\nCan I transport this place back to Jacksonville???  We are sorely in need of decent Chinese food."
3,"There's honestly not much to write about - it's a movie theater. There's nothing truly unique about it. But it is nice, big, and clean. It's not too crowded and laid-out nicely. I also like that it is separate from the rest of the casino (more separate than the movie theaters in other casinos). I also appreciate that matinees are only $6.75, which is practically a bargain compared to some other theaters. And I must say that their popcorn does seem to be tastier than other places. And the concession area is a much better layout than in other theaters. Though, the concession items are just as over-priced as other theaters."
3,"Played at Shelly Sharpe, a.k.a. Vista Del Camino yesterday with a buddy of mine. I hadn't played here in a few years but it was great to get out, walk the course, and hurl the Frisbee's around the park.\n\nI really enjoy playing here as its an easy walk and the park is nice. They change up the location of the baskets from time to time which makes it an interesting play whenever you get out. The most challenging part is the #1 hole which you have to toss over the water as well as a few other holes where the water is in play. \n\nI'd recommend that you are equipped with footwear you can remove fairly quickly just in case you have to get in that nasty pond to find a disk you let get away from you on an errant drive (if you're willing to do that). My buddy and I both had to dip our feet into the water to rescue our discs yesterday. Despite the pond hazard, this is a great place to get in a quick round of disc golf in Scottsdale as the park is in great shape and it is tended to pretty well.\n\nAn added bonus of playing here is that Spinners on the Green is located in the shopping center adjacent to the park. If and when you lose a disc to a tree or the pond, they're right there for you to scoop up a new Frisbee or two before or after a round."
4,"Love this place! My fiance and I went before a show at the Byham Theater nearby. The evening was our Christmas gift to each other, so we went all out. Our food was great and our waiters made an excellent wine suggestion. Definitely not cheap, but will assuredly be the place we go for our next special event."
4,"I was really surprised to find La Cerise sitting pretty in this dingy, dreich part of town. If you could talk to cafe's, I'd ask \""what's a cafe like you doing in a place like this?\""\n\nMore like a Parisian deli than a cafe in Edinburgh, the delightful La Cerise glimmers like a jewel in this downtrodden area of Leith. With homemade cakes, Greek pastries, pies and amazing ice cream, it is homemade continental cooking at its best. Served up off cold slabs, the apple pie looks to die for, and they have delicious specials of the day for low prices. I on the otherhand skipped straight to dessert and had some lovely, creamy chocolate ice cream (which is homemade I believe).\n\nThe place is decorated in rich reds and greens, and its ornate appeal and Victorian tiles give it a very turn of the 20th century, bohemian appeal. You can imagine a genteel generation keeping up with their memoirs in a place like this. It adds a bit of much needed flavour to this tacky area, and is a welcome break to the line of takeaways living beside it. If you can be bothered trudging through the rougher end of Leith to get to it, you will be rewarded with fantastic, eager service with a smile, delicious food and lovely surroundings. It fits the standard of the Royal Mile, but Leith should be happy to have it in this area!"
1,"Very mediocre, and overpriced for the quality of the food we were served.  The duck soup was incredibly fatty and salty and hubby's chicken something was of a very generic flavor and texture.  Reminded me of the Chinese leftovers you eat when you have nothing left in the fridge."
1,Awesome service and perfect portion sizes BUT the taste of the food could use improvement.
0,"This is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant without ordering. I can understand they're busy but this is ridiculous. My family and I waited at least an hour and did the whole online \""Wait Less\"" thing. I can tell you that's a hunk of bull. When we were finally seated we waited and waited for at least someone to take our drink orders. That didn't happen and only one person came up to us saying they'll be there shortly (hint: we didn't see them again surprise surprise). I think the icing on the cake was a party who got seated AFTER my family got bread. We didn't even get that. \n\nAnyways, I'm disappointed I didn't even get to eat. We'll probably never ever visit this location again."
2,"I've been to this shop several times and while they are not spectacular they really don't deserve the snipey-ness of some of the other reviews.  Maybe not fit for a pastry chef - but hey, even if it is cake mix cake, I like cake mix cake so long as it's prepared properly. So I think that this is a nice little place to stop for a quick and relatively cheap treat.  Bottom-line, It's worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood but I'll agree it's not necessarily worth going very far out of your way."
4,"On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.\n\nThe outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style. \n\nSeated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.  \n\nFood wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness. \n\nOne of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.\n\nSome might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.\n\n\n*(Head chef, Akira Back, has worked with industry greats such as chefs Nobu and Morimoto.)"
0,Awful service and mediocre food
3,"Stumbled upon this place while tooling around the Freemont Experience. Good stumble! \n\nI only had a salad with golden beets and feta on it, but it was delish with that orange vinaigrette on it, yumm!\n\nI wish I had more time to come back here, but def will in the future! The owner's son was SO nice...and cute!"
4,"Grace Point Church is an exciting, innovative,and engaging church in North Las Vegas. They offer a welcoming environment where you can explore what it means to have a relationship with God through Jesus Christ, develop friendships with others in the community, and enjoy an experience that will inspire, encourage, challenge, and motivate you.\n\nGrace Point welcomes everyone. They realize people are at different places on their spiritual journey. It's their primary goal to simply help you take the next step on that journey. They provide a \""come as you are\"" environment where skeptics are welcome, questions are encouraged, and growth happens.\n\nThe dress is casual. The music rocks. The people are friendly. And the message is real to life.\n\nI was never a person that had to go to church before now I don't want to miss a Sunday. I also love that they are super involved with the community!! The child care is great everyone that watches the kids are background checked. They have child care for infant to crawling, walking to 2 years, 3-5 years. Then they move up to GP kidz 1st grade to 5th grade, and for your older ones the have GP students during their 11:15 service for 6th -12 grade."
3,"Went to Basil to check it out with a good friend and it was good.  This was probably the best Pad Thai that I have had.  The level of spice was pretty good ... although I should have gone with \""Thai-spicy\"" but definitely a great meal.  The service was pretty good and the food came out pretty quickly ... always a good thing.  I will definitely be going back."
3,"What's not to love? \n\nCool small-diner atmosphere, crazy good food, ginormous portions, decent coffee (so many places underestimate the power of a good cup of joe), and you can laugh at Guy's stencil near the register. \n\n4-egg chorizo and jalapeno scramble... if you see it on the board, GET IT."
3,"Booked the \""O\"" Suite at The Hotel for surprise 80th birthday. We booked the room about a month in advance. After the 4.5 hour drive from LA, just wanted to kick it in the room and chill...It was about 4 pm, check in is 3 pm.\n\nNow, the last thing you want to hear when trying to check in is \""I'm sorry your room in not ready\""...OMG! I'm a little perturbed at this point. We are spending $750 a night, prepaid, its now 4pm & room NOT READY!! Wow.\n\nWe booked a total of 4 rooms, none were ready at 4pm. A little disturbing since LV hotels are getting more strict as to check in time (now most are 4 pm) , but want you checked the hell out at 11 am! Ostensibly to get room clean for next guest!!!! Well???\n\nHotel employee was very helpful. I realize it wasnt his fault, But it is hard not to take it out on people who are assisting you. So, after some discussion back and forth, the nice person upgraded us to the \""L\"" Suite...which was simply wonderful! A beautiful suite with nice view and very acccomdating for the party of 18.\n\nOne issue, the TV near the jacuzzi tub was not working...Oh Well!\n\nOur only issue with room...no refrigerator, no microwave, no utensils whatsoever. Oh well, I dont understand why some of these accomodations are not included, Yes, you can rent them for $35, which we did for microwave.\n\nAll the personnel we came across at The Hotel were very nice and very inviting. From the Valet staff, to the Desk Personnel, to the Housekeeping Staff...All were very nice to us, constantly greeting us and making us feel special.\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes! We are re-booking for another birthday party... I think the personnel make the difference here. Nicely done..."
1,"So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision. \n\nPerhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful. \n\nBetween my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either). \n\nOur server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.\n\nIf you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.\n\nI will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe."
0,"I'm a little hesitant to write such a poor review of a new business but I feel the need to let others know about the experience my friend and I encountered at this so called 'salon' , especially since I saw another deal posted online today.\n\nA friend and I purchased a deal for the severely discounted mani/pedi service through Google Deals and should have been wary of such a good deal. I believe it is just the one lady and scheduling the appointment took several phone calls and texts and weird conversations with a so call business partner.  I finally received a call back and after some discussion about accommodating my friend and I at the same time, it was decided that she could bring in a 'friend' and get us done at the same time so one didn't have to wait.\n\nAs Shar B stated, this is not in a salon but a rather small room within a building complex with limited space.  There are two tables and a small love seat where they perform the pedicures.  There is a limited amount of colors to pick from since as she stated, she was just starting out. Fair enough. The manicure turned out okay but I think she talked more than actually worked on my nails and my cuticles were barely trimmed. One of the main reasons I go for a manicure. At one point, she started to look for a tool and realized she had left it in her purse from an event the night before and went to retrieve it. I was shocked as she then started to use the tool on me! The other alarming part of all of this is, the two women talked in depth about the cleanliness of other salons and about how dirty they were and what kind of infections you could get. I'm no sanitization expert but I'm pretty sure pulling a tool out of your purse is NOT sanitized. We moved on to the pedicure and it was just as bad. My feet were placed in a bowl of water that had been brought in from another room since there is no running water in the room. I believe some hand soap was added to the water just before I put my feet in. Fancy.  At one point she even forgot to put a second coat of polish on my big toe.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention was the conversation. We were told at length about how little they were making on the deal and she had hoped people would tip on the real value of $92 rather than the deal price. Yikes, now she's expecting $15-20 tip. In addition, we got to listen to some other stories that made both my friend and I raise a few eyebrows. \n\nOverall, it was a very odd, alarming, unprofessional and uncomfortable experience for close to two hours. I felt like my friend and I could have done a better job at home doing it ourselves...for free. At several times during the service I thought about just getting up and walking out. I don't like giving such a poor review of someone just starting their business but this 'business' needs some serious help. I would NEVER go back based on the service performed. Had I gotten this deal through Groupon, I would have requested a refund immediately from Groupon. Sorry."
2,"I'd heard this restaurant advertised a lot on the radio and really wanted to try it.  It was a bit busy when we came in for dinner, but the service was still good.  I ordered a Porterhouse steak and for what we paid for it, it seems to me it should've been a lot more tender than it was.  That was a disappointment, to be sure.  We both ordered sides of creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  They were both very good, but I wish we had known how big they were going to be; one serving is enough for two people.  The steak was huge too, and I probably left 1/3 of it.\n\nAlthough I was disappointed with the steak, I'd like to give this restaurant chain a second chance."
3,Good hospital everybody was very friendly this is my first time going.. \nI looked it up on yelp because my dog needed shots and this one had the best Reviews.. And it was very reasonable
0,"If I could give it even less than a star I would. I ordered food for the last time last night. $20 minimum delivery and since I live 4 miles from the store, I was charged a $4 delivery charge, plus I tipped on top of it. That is fine. The problem started when I ate the food. Nothing I ordered was good!\n\nThe orange chicken, while dressed with an orange wheel was abomidable. Absolutely no flavor at all. It tasted like I took chicken out of my freezer and fried it. That's it. No seasoning, no flavor, no sauce.\n\nI got the crab puffs(or whatever their terminology is there). Where in the world was the cream cheese? It tasted like sugar!!! How does someone mess up a crab puff. I couldn't even choke an entire one down!\n\nThen the \""egg roll\"" order I added on to meet the delivery requirement.....Took one bite and it made me want to throw up! Beyond terrible!\n\nI ordered late at night and after receiving the terrible food and trying it, the store was closed. I called back in today to tell them how dissatisfied I was with the food, and not only was I called a \""liar\"" by the person who answered the phone, I was told they can't do anything because I was a liar. I have never been spoken to like this before, and would never speak to one of my customers like this. I offered to drive to them with the food, which I kept to prove to them how terrible it was, but she told me to call 911. I have no idea what this restaurant is thinking, or how they teach their employees to act, but clearly calling a customer a liar and then telling me to call 911 is completely unreasonable. \n\nThe food is overpriced and terrible. I don't mind paying for overpriced food, but when I couldn't even eat more than a single bite, that is not right!"
2,The coffee ain't bad but the owner really rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered an iced Americano and wanted a bit of vanilla syrup in it. The owner then gave me a look and went on about taking away from the true coffee taste. It looks like I am not the only one who has experienced this either. I'll be back simply because the coffee was pretty good and I like supporting local but will avoid the owner for fear of getting an inferiority complex.
3,"We had one of these in our neighborhood in Vegas.  So I was excited when I saw that they were opening one in our neighborhood here.  One of the things I love about this place is that you get to write down your order on a bag, so that there's a lesser chance of them getting the order wrong.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw#1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw\n\nI ended up ordering a Regular 7.5\"" Grinder w/Chips & Soda, $8.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=LcSFYq6moqRwVGnnHRdTaQ#LcSFYq6moqRwVGnnHRdTaQ\n\nUnlike some of the other reviewers, I think they make a decent Sandwich here.  I realize there are cheaper Sandwich shops, but Which Wich has their own style and flavor.  Their sauces and toppings are better than average and the Bread is very good.  Overall, it's a pretty good meal.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
1,"I agree with the others who said that the cupcakes were dry and bland. I love cupcakes and have eaten my fair share. I was so excited to find another cupcake shop in Charlotte, but unfortunately it just isn't all that great. The cupcakes look good, but the cake was pretty dry and the frosting was dry as well. I think they would probably taste better fresh out of the oven, but they tasted like they had been sitting out all day. Another thing I didn't like was that the strawberry or raspberry cupcakes just had flavored frosting, not strawberry or raspberry flavored cake as well. The staff was super-friendly, and I really wanted to love these cupcakes. If you are looking for a great cupcake in Charlotte, head to Polka Dot Bake Shop instead!"
4,"Wayne fixed my Asus tablet quickly and at a very reasonable price. I am glad I found a tech person I can trust with my computers and at a price the big box stores will never be able to match!, just all around great, personalized service!\nHe is also a really nice guy willing to explain the techy stuff to people like me who are not tech savvy. \nAnd so nice to support a small business:)"
4,I love this place. I have been a member now for 2 years and I can honestly say I love coming to the classes. The rooms are hot so come prepared with water. The instructors rock and you can check it out for free for a week to decide if it is for you or not.
2,"This has been the most user-friendly Indian meal I've ever had.  Now, although I've grown up a bit since high school and my taste buds have matured along with it, I often find Indian foods overwhelming.  Sometimes all I'll taste is cumin and coriander and that just doesn't do it for me.  But here at Copper we got a chicken tikka masala dish which was awesome and delicious, kind of like juicy chicken in an Indian influenced cream of tomato sauce.  The seasoning was subtle.  I also greatly enjoyed their shrimp and coconut dish, which I suppose was less than authentic but just had a wonderful grilled flavor.  And you probably have to deliberately screw up garlic naan in order for it to be bad.  Luckily they did not do so.  I didn't care for the rice - my view on rice as a side, especially to food as seasoned as Indian food, is that its supposed to kind of be the simple carb that you can use to mellow out your food if need be.  This rice was super cuminified, so I didn't care for it as a side. Samosas were crispy on the outside and tasty. The cauliflower appetizer was also savory and delicious. Service was impeccable, attentive and extremely friendly.  Overall I wouldn't mind coming back.  At least, I'm not afraid to return."
1,"The drinks were pretty good; I had the dirty chai. The service, was the worst I've ever received. \n\nI felt extremely unwelcome and it took 10 minutes to make a couple drinks. During that time, the two people working behind the counter never looked at us and took their sweet time making the drinks. \n\nWe considered leaving several times. \n\nI will not be going back."
1,"This new group of employees doing the drying might have all the proper paperwork but they don't have professionalism! 1 guy seems to be the loud mouth ring leader, even refused to help another employee asking for assistance cause \""it's his cousin and he can say that\"". That vehicle had to be run through the car wash because it waited too long."
2,"After reading horrible reviews of this airline I was nervous going on vacation, but guess what, it was not as bad as everything I read.  First I weighed my bags at home to make sure they were the required weight, and hell I even measured them.  I pre-paid them on the internet and my bags went smoothly thru checkout.  I flew from Vegas to Dallas round trip on the redeye and the plane was on time and they did not loose my bags.  Yes the seats are a little cramped, but I am 6ft and 205 and still was able to slide them under the seats in the front of me a bit for the two hour trip, my observation is 75% of the passengers are overweight, so what do you expect.  My trip back to Vegas was fine too..the plane was about 45 minutes delayed in leaving, but otherwise then that everything went fine.  Folks your flying no frills, A to B airline, read the website, follow the procedures and you should be fine.  Now I know they have planes that break down and are delayed etc... which they need to work on, but my personal trip was fine.  Will I fly them again, yes if it is 2 hrs and under...for a longer flight I will pay more for the leg room and food."
4,"I've been going to the Sugar Shack on 5th for about 3 months now to get my Steelers fix.  Yes, I said it, Loud & Clear - I am a Steelers Fan ! ! !   The Sugar Shack reminds of a few bars in the 'Burgh.  It is a Steelers bar and a Cardinals bar!  ?*$%@  how is that possible?  St. Louis Cardinals - think baseball...  Anyway, this place has the mandatory bar cuisine, burgers, French fries, etc.  The beers are reliable, not too diverse.  The Steelers Fans are here though!  If you are in the Scottsdale area and not up for drive to Harold's in Cave Creek, the Sugar Shack is a throw-back to real-deal, the Iron Curtain!"
2,"I ate lunch at this restaurant yesterday and was surprised how nice it was inside.  I expected more of a chain-looking type place.\n\nThe food was pretty good, although it's tough to find something that stands out when you just order pizza...as far as the pizza's go though, right up there with the best of 'em for those flat stone oven type pizza.\n\nService was good as well.  I would go for lunch again, or take clients, but probably not go personally as there are many other choices that are more unique."
3,I scream You scream We ALL scream for ICE CREAM!!! Any 2 scoop sundae & a bottled water for $4.99 get a FREE mini basbeall helmet!!!\n\nMy FAVORITE Ice Cream place since I was a kid. Always the best hand-scooped flavor selection plus I almost always fill up just from all the sampling ;) \n\nStill my favorite: Rocky Road
2,This place is open for breakfast on the weekends even though the yelp page says its closed. Nice relaxed atmosphere pleasant service this morning. food was fair
4,"I love Love LOVE this place! They have the nicest German cakes (arguably some are Austrian but the guy who runs it is German), pastries, cream cakes, breads and much more. \n\nAs the cake slices are big, super sweet and creamy they are not to be enjoyed every day (hello spare tyre) but a nice treat on those special afternoons or weekends with a friend or loved one. You can also buy german chocolate and coffee, and certified kosher challah for your shabbes."
2,"I was in Vegas on business and was staying at the Luxor when I decided to try out the spa.  \n\nThey offer many different massages such as hot stone, lomi lomi, sports, deep tissue and therapeutic.  I opted for the swedish since I wasn't feeling too stressed.  Once you sign up for a treatment you are granted access to the sauna, steam room, plunge pools and lounge area.  The lounge area is stocked with fruit and many beverages to hydrate you.  \n\nI decided to utilize the plunge pools and sauna before I went back for my massage.  Before I knew it the therapist called me back for my treatment.  She had strong hands and adjusted the pressure for my target areas.  It was an overall good massage and experience.\n\n***I do have to say that the only lacking area is the decor.  I think they need to remodel.  I have been to better designed spas and when you are in Vegas you expect the best.  Hopefully remodeling plans are in their future."
4,"What a nice shop with two very helpful and lovely owners!  This shop has a lot of unique pet items that I havne't seen in Chicago-including many doggie games, antler chews and fun chew toys.  I really enjoyed exploring this little gem of a shop and I've recommended to my friends who live in Madison.  I also love that the owners have big pictures of their doggies all over the store-very sweet!"
3,one the best thai joints out there; crispy rice is a must try. and there's a dish with raw fresh shrimp with a really tasty spicy sauce.  very creative and very good.
4,"Easily the best money I've spent in a long time. I've done a lot of research on sensory deprivation for over a year now and I've found the right place to do it in Las Vegas! Completely relaxing first session, I wish would've floated longer. \n\nAs someone who is a workaholic, and has a lot of back, neck, and leg pains I wasn't expecting to feel like a brand new person, but I can honestly say I've never felt better. I most definitely am returning for many more sessions, and recommend everyone to try floating. \n\nJohn helped me out and answered every question I had. Amazing experience all around."
4,"Anthony did an amazing job! He fixed up my hair after I damaged it pretty bad, it looks so awesome now! I highly recommend seeing him! This is definitely one of the best haircuts I've ever gotten.(:"
1,"Its okay... \nFoods good.. Had the strawberry salad \nService is good... \nJust really don't care for the clientele. Snooty Scottsdale women who \""lunch\"". \nPerhaps I wasn't in the mood, I don't know. Just did nothing for me. \nWouldn't go back."
4,"Stone crab... so delicious, so succulent, so heavenly... Mannn I wish I hadn't been so hung over during dinner here... Imagine my taste buds when they're fully alive! AAAHHH!! \n\nGreat bar, as well. Bartender made me a great dirty martini. I wish I can go back. Mmm... maybe I'll have a dream about this place when I go to sleep tonight."
2,"Good ol' Zodie's. When the smoking ban went into effect, this bar ditched their kitchen and mounted a GIANT sign with bold, red print, exclaiming, \""SMOKERS WELCOME.\"" I admit, the ban is probably a good idea. I will cover that statement with, \""To each his own,\"" everyone's opinion counts, etc. etc. etc. But I do admire the zeal with which they stood to their cause. Now, the decor in Zodie's didn't click in my gourd until very recently. Why? I don't know, because now that I get it, it's just so apparent. The place is scattered with zodiac symbols, sun catchers, and wind chimes. The lighting changes, too, depending on who's on shift. If it's Jim or Pete, the lights are at their fullest level. But if Charla is working, she'll turn the lights completely off, fill the joint with candle light, and talk to you about where your sun is and which planet is in your ... I can't ever follow, but it sure sounds nice. Everyone likes a scapegoat when their luck has run dry, yeah? I've also heard several accounts of the haunt who hangs out at Zodie's, which just adds to the place's appeal. For goofs like me, anyway. I guess he wears a white T shirt, and likes to play with the TVs and radio. I've never witnessed this, but I keep hoping.\n\nThe drinks are good 'n strong. The prices are definitely affordable. I did, however, cringe a little when I selected the \""Night Life\"" category, because every time we've been to Zodie's, the only other people at the bar are other employees. They do have a Golden Tee machine, and if you take a chance to get to know the bartenders, their stories can certainly be entertaining.\n\nIt may not be for everyone, but this is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail."
3,"A fun place to hang out with friends.  The food is generally very good though not consistently so.  The portion sizes are huge so we end up taking something home with us every time.  Their prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get.  Love so many of their beers.  I just wish the beer was colder all the time.  Maybe I'm an amateur beer drinker, but I like it really cold.  Sometimes it's almost room temperature here which doesn't stop me from drinking it, of course!"
0,"The reason I'm giving this place one star as opposed to two is a simple, yet annoying element of this place: the portraits of dead musicians on the wall. WTF do Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, or Sid Vicious have anything to do with Japanese food?\n\nThese portraits on the wall are just one of many examples of how this place does not get anything. This place is treated as a club by the bouncers outside, but it's really just a sub-par restaurant in the disguise of a high-end Japanese restaurant. So, Geisha A Go Go are you a club? Bar? Japanese place? All of them?\n\nI was here for a friend's birthday a little while back and I found that the food overall is not worth what you pay for. Of course they go with a \""minimalist\"" gimmick and give you insultingly small portions. The service is alright, but again, nothing special.\n\nI don't think even hara-kiri would bring any honor to this place's horrible sushi. I guess the usual Scottsdale, Diesel jean-wearing date rapist wouldn't know the difference between good sushi and mediocre with all the blow dripping down his throat, so I guess this usually goes unnoticed.\n\nNow, if you talk to a fan of Geisha A Go Go you might hear them mention, \""But, they've got really cool bathrooms.\"" Well, I don't go to a restaurant to dump out the meal I just ate. Japanese Fusion Restaurant fail."
2,"GREAT hotel, even during construction. but, i gotta say, if we didn't have a Gift Card to Marriott from our wedding, we probably wouldn't have stayed here. the price point didn't match those of the Gaming casinos. on average, the Strip rooms i.e Monte Carlo, Flamingo, Harrah's, Luxor etc, all were well between $50-$75, albeit they all come with Resort fees. our room for a one-night stay at MGC was at $120, and that's with the construction they had going on. \n\nlocated very conveniently to Planet Hollywood and the Cosmo/Aria/Vdara/Crystals complex, this hotel is at a prime spot. they have a full service front desk, bell desk, valet service and room service. the pool on the roof, Skybar 38 is small, but, put together nicely. great views of the Strip area as well. our room was great, with a microwave, fridge, sink and coffee maker available. comfy beds, plenty of closet space and a nice bathroom area. \n\nwouldn't mind staying here again IF we had another GC or they lowered the prices to something more reasonable."
3,"This restaurant looks like it's been there forever, in a neighborhood that's not too pretty. But the food is great, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are low. I had my usual favorites for trying out Vietnamese restaurants: pho wth rare beef and brisket, and banh xeo. Both came in generous portions. The pho was aromatic and very tasty, and the banh xeo was crispy and bursting with beansprouts, pork, and shrimp. Definitely a place for return visits."
0,"If I could give this a negative 5 stars I would.WORST DINING EXPERIENCE SO FAR IN LAS VEGAS! I went there last night with 2 friends and ordered a steak. I got the steak (which was IHOP quality) and it had 2 pieces of plastic cooked into it. They were not small pieces, they were the size of silver dollars! I showed the waiter and he said \""that is from the plastic wrapping we cut the meat out of\"" (This WAS the same kind of steaks that Dennys and IHOP uses!) Well he asked me if I wanted a new steak and I jokingly said \""yes, but no plastic please\"" and laughed. He then rudely replied \""yeah, thats common sense, don't you think\""! and walked away. My friends and I looked at each other and were shocked and asked if we had heard him correctly. I got up and went to ask the hostess if the manager was there and if I could speak to them about my waiter. The hostess informed me that my waiter WAS THE OWNER! The waiter/owner then came up behind the hostess and confronted me about me trying to make a complaint. I told him I didn't like how he talked to me at my table and that he then replied \""Then get the (explative) out of my restaurant! I said get out, you and your friends too!\"" I stood there stunned and actually laughed in his face. That made him angry so he called over 2 \""goons\"" from the dining room to try to muscle me out. One guy walks up and takes off his suit jacket like he is going to assault me. Not cool at all!  This being my first time in this restaurant will also be my last! The service was atrocious and the food was IHOP quality for strip prices. And then to add insult to injury, they still made us pay for our meal!"
2,The food is not bad. Few hot chicks. Pretty lucky place for me :P (I won money in BlackJack)
1,"I don't like this place.  Uninventive sushi, unexcited staff, and shitty lighting that makes it impossible to read the menu.  About the only plus is it's proximity to other things you'd want to do with tourist friends, and the fact that there's some decent eye candy to look at while eating.  I had two rolls here this weekend for dinner and my bill was almost as much as an AYCE joint off the strip.  I remember their happy hour being good, but outside of that, go elsewhere.  Oooh, try Sushisamba, that's much better."
0,"Awful, Rude, Cold Food, Expensive, Never ever ever go to this Awful place"
4,"We were picked up at our hotel by \""Johnny Limo\"" in a cute purple limousine, arrived at the restaurant and upon walking in I felt as though we had stepped into a scene from the Sopranos.  We joined our friends, some of whom are Vegas locals, and I'm so glad they let us in on their secret spot.  The food was amazing!  Our table shared about 5 appetizers and everything tasted fresh and authentic.  I especially loved the roasted red peppers and fontina cheese.  I ordered the scallops as my meal and they were big and tasty, covered in melted provolone.  Thanks for the ride Johnny, can't wait to come back to Vegas."
2,Could I get a 3 1/2 possibly?\n\nService is always very hospitable.\n\nSushi in the summer can taste a bit on the mushy side.  Also the green tea makes the arnold palmers not so great...\n\nVolcano Chicken and Vegetable Tempura are sure bets everytime.  Great place to go for happy hour if you are going to keep it simple.\n\nWe come here all the time and it is very serviceable.\n\nDid I mention I love the Volcano Chicken??
2,"Cool atmosphere...  The bartenders were lacking.  This would be a cool place to get up for a game, but not recommended for dinner."
2,"There were some things that Golden Corral gets very right, and there are other things that they get very wrong.  I realize however, then when you try to crossbreed a southern buffet chain, with California-type restaurant quality standards....things can get a bit awkward.  Imagine Honey Boo-Boo shopping in Beverly Hills....you get the idea.   I would imagine that much of the food and atmosphere decisions come not from the owners of the specific franchise in the City of Industry, but from the Golden Corral corporate office, who makes decisions based on their own standards of what is acceptable to serve.\n\nFOOD:  I don't know if I have seen such a juxtaposition in a buffet - usually I find buffet food to either be all great, all terrible, or all mediocre.  There were some GREAT choices here....Hush Puppies (rare to see at a buffet!), Texas Toast (which I could just eat all day long), sauteed mushrooms, Bourbon chicken, all different kinds of salad options, hand scooped ice cream (also very rare to find in a buffet!), the chocolate fountain (with surprisingly good tasting chocolate!), and even cotton candy (especially great for the kids).  Now the bad....all of the Chinese food options!  I am not one who has particularly high standards for Chinese food, but dear Lord!  Do you know the expression \""chewing the fat\""?  Well - now you can!  Just put some of their Chinese chicken options on your plate and start chewing!  The low quality of the Chinese options is surprising to me, especially since this buffet is located in a community heavily populated with Asian Americans.  This is what makes me think that food decisions are strictly made on a corporate level.  Avoid the Mexican options too.  We here in Cali know our Mexican food - and you can't call this Mexican food.  I don't know what kind of food you would call it....\n\nATMOSPHERE:  Of course because it is a buffet, we know the atmosphere is going to be (1) Crowded and (2) Loud.  So that is completely acceptable.  The buffet area got a little hectic when the steaks were coming out, and the people started lining up.  Even that was acceptable.  However, the booths had absolutely no cushion, so you are just sitting on hard plastic.  (Maybe this is to discourage you from staying too long?!)  Ouch!\n\nSERVICE:  A+!!!!  The guys and gals that work here in such a stressful and busy environment sure have a great attitude!!  Everyone was so friendly and attentive, and service was given with a smile.  Our server was prompt refilling our drinks, and clearing our plates.  And not just our server, but every server in there had the friendliest dispositions!\n\nI see so much potential in this place, but unless they can break away from their food quality products/standards set by their corporate office, they will just be mediocre.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:  This place can be very crowded, with a line that can stretch out the door on the weekends.  Go early in the week (lunch if possible, but dinner is fine too) to avoid the crowds.  Oh yeah, be ghetto and bring your own bottle of either Tapatio or Sriracha chili sauce - you may need it, since much of the food lacked so much flavor!"
3,"They have the best pimiento cheeseburger in town, plus hand cut French fries and a nice selection of beer on draft. It's one of my favorite lunch spots."
0,"After reading the reviews we decided to take the family here. The mine tour was over priced and horribly boring and a waste of time. The mine is fake and the tour guide was awefull. The Saloon would have been decient if the bartender didnt talk to me, my wife and  my children 7 and 10 yrs old about politics and religion - how Muslims are bad - this was out of the blue. This place is horribly boring for anyone any age. You would think this fake place the people could get in character and play a part in the  atmosphere - cowboys..miners. Instead the people were sad and the place was sad. Do not go here unless you want to be bored out of your mind."
0,"I created a Yelp account just to write this review. Believe me, very surprising because PF Chang's is my go-to for consistent good food.  I ordered from the lunch menu for pick up. I arrived 3 mins after it was suppose to be ready. The nice bartender was packaging it up. I got pepper steak with brown rice and egg drop soup. When I checked my bag - all that was in there was the pepper steak entree. I asked the bartender for the egg drop soup. While he went to get the soup, I decided to check my bag to ensure I received the right entree. I'm glad I did, because there was NO rice in there - just the plain pepper steak entree!!! So when the bartender came back with the egg drop soup, I had to ask him for the brown rice!! Truly frustrating and a pain. Especially since I placed the order online 30 mins prior.  As if the experience itself weren't bad enough - when I get back to work (which is literally 2 mins away), the food was cold. The pepper steak was ice cold like it had been sitting there for hours or made a long time ago.  Very disappointing - I will not be returning to this PF Chang's or any other one for a long, long time."
2,"I went to this buffet with my family on Friday afternoon around 1pm. There was no one in line... that should have been my first sign to walk away and try something else... but we had been here before and it wasn't that bad.\n\nThe prime rib, cold crab legs, and hot crab legs are the star of this buffet. Other than that, there isn't much that is tasty. I liked the beef empanadas, but they were a little too salty. The shrimp tempura was good, but tasted exactly like the kind you can buy from Costco. The desserts area was lacking, but they do have very tasty cookies... especially the one with white chocolate and cranberries! I also really enjoyed the vanilla sauce with the bread pudding.\n\nThe service was ok. Our plates stacked up with 3 or 4 dishes before being taken away, but our drinks were brought out and refilled in a timely manner. \n\nI wouldn't suggest coming here if you are only going to go to one vegas buffet during your trip. But it's not bad, it's just not as good as the Bellagio or Wynn Buffets."
1,"There's a Japonais I Chicago, but I've never been.  It was downstairs in my hotel so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  The food was mediocre for a sushi restaurant.  The sushi menu they had was actually pretty pathetic.  They have a full sushi bar that I sat near, with sushi chefs, but they didn't offer a wide array of sushi or hand rolls.  I suppose I could have asked to order something that was not on the menu.  The hot food looked good, but it seemed like things you could get at any other kind of Japanese restaurant or steakhouse.  The sashimi and negiri was extremely over priced compared to other sushi places in Las Vegas.  I was at Little Budda at Palms and also Sushi Roku at Caesar's and those places were 100xs better than Japonais.   I'd recommend those two over Japonais any day.  \n\nThe service was OK - I can't say it was good, but I can't say it was terrible.  I was greeted and addressed with a friendly face, but everything was just sooooo slow.  Even the host saw us waiting for a table and finished his conversation with the bartender before he came to show us to our table  The restaurant was EMPTY (maybe that has something to say about the place), and there had to be about 10 servers, but my wine glass and water glass sat empty for at least 10 minutes.  For Vegas standards, the service was pretty bad.\n\nFor a plus, I had the tuna sashimi, soft shell crab roll, and tempura roll and all were very tasty.  They gave you a ton of soft shell crab on top of the roll and the sauce was great.  \n\nI think Japonais was overrated and definitely overpriced.  Not sure if I will ever try the one in Chicago."
0,"Mr. Pineapple sounded like a nice guy and his prices are good. The problem is that he is not reliable.\n\nA tenant left and I wanted to get front and back yards cleaned before the new tenants moved in. So, I called him and got an estimate. The price was good so I asked him to get the work done. He said he will do it on  the 07/05/14. He didn't do it. Then, when I called him, he said he will do it on the 07/11/14. He didn't do it. Then when I called him on 07/12/14, he didn't even bother to pick up the phone or call me back.\n\nNew tenants moved in on 07/12/14 and it wasn't fun. Yikes!"
2,what can i say this place has some of the best burger's i have ever tasted.  i love the fries and strawberry shakes.  if ever in Carolina don't leave until you try them.
3,My husband and i both ordered the patatas bravas for brunch. The portions were generous and the food was delicious and savory. I imagine this would be a great hangover cure. We wanted to get some donuts too but we were just too full. Would definitely like to try the beignets and other goodies from the $5 menu next time though!
0,I eat there a few times until I realize that they wash there hands ONLY WITH WATER NO SOAP!!!  BEWARE
2,"Nathan's hot dogs outside of Coney Island is a different story than the original.  I stopped by for a dog yesterday and the most annoying thing happened. You know when the bottom of the bun rips?  Yeah, both dogs had that problem which means that the buns we not so fresh.  I find the Nathan's across the street at NYNY to be much better on a previous trip.  But none comes close to the original location."
4,"I booked this hotel a week ago when my husband and I decided to make a trip to Tucson and needed a place to stay the night to rest before we were to meet friends so we decided to stay in Goodyear. Found the price for the Comfort Suites a great deal!\n\nThe check in was effortless. The entire facility was very clean and new looking. It was classy and quiet. Our room was great. I would definitely say this is a four star hotel. The staff friendly, the breakfast buffet was good and the room had a sofa bed, a king bed, a work desk with a business chair, a larger sized refrigerator, a small microwave, a three drawer dresser, a coffee table, a lounge chair, two end tables, alarmed clock, hair dryer and a real closet with double doors, several lamps and was very roomy. This is one of the better stays we have had in a hotel. :) we would for sure stay here again!"
2,"decent casino restaurant from the wolfgang puck family tree. service was ok as was the food but there wasn't anything that really stood out. the selection of wines seemed a bit limited and.. em.. top shelf supermarket-ish. not bad but there's certainly better, more challenging options out there."
1,"Wanna know why the US Postal Service is struggling to keep their nose above water and on the brink of insolvency?  Not adjusting their business plan upon the arrival of the Internet and Email Age, and...customers. You must keep them and their changing needs at the front of everything you do. \n\nOne day this week, I stood in line at this US Post Office for about 15 minutes, only to find out that my stuff (packed in my own box) didn't qualify for any of their Priority Mail flat rates...it would make the Large rate ONLY if I crammed it into their own awkwardly-sized, long, flat Priority Mail box. This meant I needed to:\n\n1. rip open my own taped-up box (with what??), \n2. unpack everything in it (in front of all these people waiting in line??), and \n3. re-pack it in the USPS \""large\"" Priority Mail long, very flat box (what if some of my items weren't that flat??). \n\nExasperated after considering this option, I returned their \""Priority Mail\"" tape to the counter, hopped in the car, and Yelped for the nearest UPS store. UPS gave me several shipping options, and I chose the one which got my box to its destination for $2 cheaper than the USPS, and also INCLUDED a tracking number. In and out in less than five minutes. \n\nUS Postal Service -- time to get out of the Stone Age. Customers rule now, and the world revolves around our needs and wants. We young whippersnappers will absolutely whip out our iPhones, find your competitor, and give our business to them...all while standing in your store."
1,"ehhhh. \ni've had better seafood. \nmaybe i'm picky cause i eat seafood at least 4 times a week. this is a typical seafood restaurant where very american-ized families can enjoy a dinner. \ni thought it was going to be more unique because i imagine the district to be a very hip place. but it was very mundane. nothing stood out at me. \n\ngranted, the food wasn't bad. maybe it deserves a higher rating, but i thought it was a bit overpriced for what was being served. and so that was a pretty big disappointment. \n\nso yeah, if you don't like seafood, you would really like this place!"
0,"Worst ever! I typically like these restaurants but this one is horrible.  Waited forever for our food and had to ask for one item since it was forgotten in the steamer. Then we were rewarded with it being slammed into a basket and shoved at us by a sneering girl who worked at a snail's pace. The chips were stale and the entire seating area a filthy mess. They weren't busy, so there's no excuse for any of this."
3,"We recently went tomUncorked on vacation and loved it. We sat outside on a beautiful evening, enjoyed some good and interesting wines. The wine list is creative and unpretentious. We also enjoyed some great food.  The menu has great things to share, flatbreads, gourmet sandwiches, salads. Would definitely go back again."
1,"Atmosphere is great. Food portions for the Tacos is extremely small.  More like an appetizer.  Waiter seemed disappointed that we only ordered water and iced tea for drinks instead of an alcoholic beverage (at 11 a.m.!).  Can't believe a Mexican Restaurant charges for chips and salsa with the prices of the food. No extras come with what you order - no rice, no beans for expensive lunch. Won't be back."
2,"I went there just 2 weeks after the opening and I have DEFINITELY had better!\nwe had asked for a 2 double bed size bedroom and we arrived, the girl at the reception says we don't have any available!!! what you wanted was a \""reference\"" and we couldn't guarantee it!!!! WHAT?!?!?!? they offered to give us a one king size bed with an extra spring bed!!!! with no discounts or anything!!!!! of course, not way we could accept that, we asked to talk to the manager and she came and after a long discussion she released a few \""reserved rooms\"" so that we could get what HAD ALREADY PAID FOR!!!!!\n-CONS:\n1) bad reception upon arrival\n2) bad room service, I had to wait in queue for 10 minutes and hang finally\n3) bad quality of rooms, like totally torn towels (only after 2 weeks of usage!!!!)\n4) bad phone reception\n\nPROS:\n1) big hotel and casino\n2) exceptional design, very modern\n3) new facilities\n4) GREAT bakery and coffee place in the lobby and second floor"
4,"Our experience here was awesome, I love this place a lot. We scheduled a gender check appointment with a groupon 50% off (without coupon its $75). There are different packages 3D and 4d and HD for you to choose from depend on how far along you are. I really like their ultrasound room: comfortable chairs for relatives, huge screen, dark, quiet and nice facilities. \nThe first time, our baby was not cooperate at all but the technician was really patient. She tried to wake baby up and get her to\nmove but no luck. \nThey scheduled another appointment for me the same day. I went to get 2 donuts, walked for 30 minutes and came back. We were amazed how sweets can really make the baby move. We easily found out baby's gender this time and its a girl. Will definitely come back!!!"
0,"Ambience was trendy, Food was good, overpriced, but the service was AWFUL.  (Dear Bryan, we didn't stiff you.  10% was overtipping for the attitude that you brought.)  From the second we sat down till the moment we had to ask for our check, we were a bother. There were FIVE long legged girls working the hostess counter but only saw THREE waiters in the entire restaurant.  And it wasn't lack of experience.  He brought the Gordon Ramsay \""you're an idiot\"" attitude to all of his tables.  So if you want to be treated like a moron for asking if the toffee pudding is good and being told that it's like \""EVERY OTHER toffee pudding in normal restaurants, \""scoff\"" then go somewhere else.  After 5 years of waiting tables, I don't complain.  This experience was the exception."
0,"I echo a lot of reviewer's thoughts on this place - I'd rather suck a hobo's toes than ever set foot here again.\n\nMy fantastic night started with my promoter chatting with my girlfriend and I on the strip. \""Did you know that Hakkasan is the number 10 nightclub in the world?\""\n\nWhy no I did not. \n\n\""Would you like free entry?\"" \n\nWell sure, but I'm with a big group- 12 girls 11 guys. \n\n\""Oh even better! Just give me your names and I'll handle everything! You'll get right in for free!\""\n\nWhat a great deal, promoter guy!\n\nFast forward 9 hours later, and there is a clusterfuck of EPIC proportions in front the club. I'm directed to wait outside of the goddamn casino next to a Starbucks with my entire group and wait 50 minutes in the 90 degree heat in my suit. \n\nWhich to be fair to the club and promoter, is the EXACT FUCKING OPPOSITE of the experience I was promised. \n\nIn their generosity, the club made me two wonderful offers: \n\n1. We'll take all of your girls and you guys can wait outside in this exclusive Starbucks line for another hour. \n\n2. You guys can pay us 100 bucks each to get in. \n\nThe bouncers were generally clueless assholes and after half heartedly venturing into the club,  we eventually left and went to the midget bar (Beecher's) and it was awesome. \n\nI hope everyone involved with this club gets scabies."
3,"If you're in the mood for Taiwanese comfort food, this is your spot. We usually order their spicy beef noodle soup, homestyle tofu, and basil eggplant. Their pork chop rice is decent as well. Service is actually a bit better compared to the typical Asian restaurant. While the ambiance is a bit shabby, the main reason to go is good food at decent prices. Oftentimes, places like this only take cash, but they accept credit cards for added convenience."
1,Been here a dozen times and its always been just ok. This time I waited an hour for sushi! Pretty sure the waitress didn't ring in half our order. Sat here 20 minutes without water.  Spicy salmon roll was salmon roll with a dollop of sriacha on top? Only reason why I'm Giving it two stars and not one is because the live music was pretty good. Won't be back any time soon.
1,How can I explain my love hate relationship with this place? I think the best way is that we have a need-based agreement of sorts. I need a coffee and I am not always ready to go into Starbucks and here is Kiva Han right across the street. Waiting. I have both shivered through a meal and sweat through a meal at this un-climate controlled cafe. The food is okay. It's filling and I like the hangover cure simply because I like all of my breakfast rolled up into an eggy pouch. Its afforable. Go some where else if you can. it's a decent social spot I have to say- again good location. I wish the owner would take it seriously.
4,"Hubby and I came here after watching jabawockees (awesome show btw) and had the signature tasting menu ($89pp) & a bottle of wine.  Definitely one of the most memorable meals we've had.  The ambiance is outstanding.  Dark, sexy, and sophisticated, which is how I felt that night.  \n\nA run-down of the dishes-\n-   Wagyu beef tartare: Our favorite dish of the night! It was a perfectly balanced dish that we couldn't get enough of.  Creamy and rich atop perfectly toasted bread.\n-  Market oysters:  This was also delicious, although it's hard to mess up fresh oysters on the shell.  The garnish added a nice kick.\n-  Grilled octopus: Relative to the other dishes, this was just mehh.  Although that's not really fair because the other dishes were just so good.\n-  Maine dayboat scallops:  WOW this was probably one of the best scallop dishes we've had!  Usually I find cooked scallops to be over/under-seasoned or over/under-seared.  This one was just right.\n-  48 beef belly:  This was everything a beef belly should be.  Decadent, fatty, melts in your mouth.  \n-  Australian wagyu sirloin:  This was an additional $15 upgrade of the tasting menu. Not disappointed.  The sirloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \n-  Green Apple mousse:  This was actually on the chef's tasting menu, but they let me switch the dessert at no extra cost.  Very interesting dessert (w/ peanut butter and celery) that took my palette on a sweet/salty adventure.  I'm a fan. \n-  Pistachio tart:  I think this was pretty good (I had a little too much wine at this point hehe)\n\n2 tasting menus (with australian wagyu) plus a bottle of wine, tip, tax- all under $300.  Not to mention the food was delicious.  Sage is definitely return-trip-worthy!"
4,It's exciting to have a dim sum restaurant close to my neighborhood.  Now I don't have to drive to Chinatown.     I ordered several traditional dim sum dishes to go and it was very good!!   It was made to order and the food was fresh and tasty with no msg!!  The price is reasonable like other dim sum places; And they also have lunch specials and dinner menus.   I will definitely go back to Dim Sum Cafe.
3,"This little cafe presented me with my finest culinary surprise during my trip to Vegas\n\nIt doesn't look like much and nothing on the menu really sticks out. I ordered a hot pastrami on rye expecting it to be small and dry. It was huge and mouthwatering. They must cook it in-house because I've NEVER had a better pastrami sandwich. I may have had one as good, but never a better one. The sandwich really made my night"
2,"I have been here twice now.\nNot really worth going twice, but the first time was years ago with my husband when we were spending two whole weeks in Vegas and ventured off the strip looking for other things to do.\nThe second, a few months ago with my son.\nMy son loved it.\nShort enough and self guided to not lose interest, along with a free sample at the end.\nThe cactus garden is nice, but nothing major, it is right out front in the parking lot.\nPlenty of easy, free parking, you can be in and out in less than half an hour.\nNot many crowds, it's a simple stop off of the strip for any chocolate lover!\nWhile the chocolate is not the best, the prices are fair and it is worth seeing, once."
1,The food was good.  The staff was terrible.  It's hard to eat good food when your stomach is turning from rude and dysfunctional waitresses.
2,"With the raining beating down outside we decided to just grab a bite here since we were staying at the Double Tree hotel attached.\n\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich with the perogies. Both were fresh, delicious and elegantly presented. (Check the pictures out).\n\nThey also started us off with some bread and 'tomato, oil' concoction for dipping. Yum!\n\nThe waitress, hostess and manager were all extremely friendly, polite, and willing to accommodate even asking if I'd like to make any substitutions to the salad without being prompted to do so. Our waitress could probably have used a little polishing. \""Are you done with the tomato stuff?\"" or \""The Bean Fritters are fritters with beans in them\"". But now I'm just being picky, she really was a great waitress overall.\n\nI'd definitely return."
4,Armand had everything all set for me when I arrived.  The service was completed and I was on my way in a very short time.  I love the service at Earnhart Cadillac.
0,"To start my review, myself and 2 friends were the only ones in the lounge. We were approached by the server.  Unfriendly unpersonable attitude.  She asked to take our order.\nUpon ordering I was asked cash or credit.  I said credit and gave her my card, she then said she need my drivers license, I thought, ok. She needs to make sure it's my card, she then tells me she has to hold my license with the credit card.  Really!   I tell her no. I am not giving my ID to anyone and I will pay cash.  She then tells me my drink \""shot of Crown\"" with a water back will be $24.00.  they even charged $2.00 for the Ice. Really!  Price gouging at its Best.   Terrible service. Uncomfortable seat. Definitely will not be returning."
0,"Burger #184: Michelin Star #19: Burger Win/All Else Fail\n\nFor my birthday weekend extra-gabanza, Vegas was the destination and burgers were on my brain. Well just one really. After countless hours search Vegas talk threads, reading endless reviews, and cross checking against all other foodie sites, I settled on Bradley Ogden for my sole Vegas burger.\n\nHidden in the dark depths of Caesar's Palace, it was quite the hike to get to the restaurant. Once inside and seated with our cohorts, I began to scan the menu for my burger. IT WASN'T THERE! Freaking out, I feverously asked our server if I could still order the burger I thought they had. Then we all learned that all the food we had wanted was on the bar menu. So in true uncouth manner, we all stayed in the dining room and all ordered from the much cheaper bar menu. I got the burger, medium-rare, as part of a 3 course meal. I also added the foie since it was my birthday week. \n\nFirst came an amuse bouche of I have no idea. The flavor was indescribable as I cannot for the life of me remember a single thing about it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=ofjbhlxnYs4RcIERrU62wg\n\nThen my wife's large and uncut salad came, meh.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=PilAaN3bksUGAQwrhd-n_g\n\nNext up was the foie; perfectly cooked and it melted beautifully in my mouth. I think it came on French toast or something like that, but whatever it was, I loved it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=R7Z22Ri5ritivCsi7as0Fg\n\nNow for the burger. It came simply presented with a tall cup of fries and a little salad thing to the side and three small dishes with some condiments. The bun, thank god, was not brioche and tasted pretty fresh.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=cV3UoVQRumiu_MC78Y_THg\n\nAfter one bite a \""rare\"" problem occurred; my burger was UNDER cooked. Luckily it wasn't raw, but it was very rare and cool in the center. At this level of cooking, it was no wonder my patty lacked a good crust. The burger was seasoned lightly, but wasn't cooked enough to really let the meat shine. My friend's medium-well patty was served closer to medium-rare and he wasn't as okay with it as I was. The fries however were outstanding. Fresh and salty, just how I like them. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=75O4GRTCxO_rVGXGDVHwPw\n\nHere is where we ran into trouble; the mussels. Two of the four in our group ordered the mussels and both ate a couple and stopped. The mussels were raw. No question or debate about it, they looked and tasted as if they were merely blanched in hot water and that was it. Our awesome server saw their disgust from across the room and made a point to make it right, despite us telling him not to worry about it. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=bvc7a3BTD80Vm7cFCm-RZw\n\nHe returned a few minutes later, and told us that the chef said if he made the mussels again, he would make them exactly the same! I didn't know what to think of that! The chef to be so bold and refuse to cook mussels so they weren't raw and make a customer happy was unreal! I have never had that happen to me in all my eating days. The chef may had well come out and spit on us. \n\nSo one ordered another dish and my wife decided to not take any chances. \n\nAnd to wrap it up, two more horrors occurred. First while my wife was eating my side salad, she chomped down on a shell! In my salad! Way to take one for the team but WTF!? Then, only moments later, my friend who sent back her mussels in exchange for scallops, bit down on a large piece of shell as well!\n\nBy the end of the meal I was mortified that I picked that place for dinner and couldn't believe how rude the chef was. Kudos to our server for being gracious throughout, but with that many issues in the kitchen, and only a par+ burger, it was the worst Michelin restaurant I've been to."
2,"Okay, 3 stars because the club is beautiful and  it has a pool in it! \n\nHowever, they asked for $7000 for a freakin small ass table. \nFORGET THAT NOISE! :( We left and went to Tryst instead. \n\nThe line by the way is ridiculous!!!  Be ready to wait for even table service."
1,"I would LOVE to tell you that the shrimp with lobster sauce is out of this world! I would enjoy waxing poetic about the jumbo size of Wahsun's eggroll's! It would please me to no end to tell you about how sweet Rose is!\n\nBut I can't.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they were closed at 6:35 pm on a Wednesday evening even thought their sign on the front window boasts \""OPEN EVERYDAY 11:00 - 10:00'.\n\nThis is the 2nd time that this has happened to me. The first time was a little over a week ago around 2:00 pm as I was leaving the Sprouts that's in the same strip mall, I glanced over at Wahsun, but they looked closed. Now, to their advantage...they ALWAYS look closed.\n\nI spent about 30 minutes the other night reading the 39 reviews here on Yelp about how incredible the food is and was impressed with the loyalty of established customers as well as the raves from the new/first time customers. I've thought about Wahsun ever since.\n\nI'm a massage therapist and after working on 7 people during my day I'm pretty hungry. I immediately drove to the restaurant...didn't stop at home...didn't run any errands...only to find the place and and no aromas wafting seductively from the building...unless you count the Pizza Hut a few doors down, but YUCK!\n\nI'm from New York and good Chinese food is difficult to find in Arizona...and I guess I still haven't found it. To say that I'm disappointed would be a gross understatement.\n\nSo here I sit, in front of my laptop, eating a quesadilla from Pollo Loco and feeling completely unsatisfied.\n\nWill I give Wahsun one more chance? Yea...I will. And ONLY because of the rave reviews here. If they hadn't been so good I'd finally resign myself to Pei Wei.\n\nBetter luck next time I guess!"
2,"They could use a little more staff with their hostesses and waiters stretched 10 different ways.  They are practically running on the floor.  We were seated and a second later was asked if we were ready to order. Mmm not quite, but I'll have a water. We ordered roast duck and charsiu fried rice which was served rather quickly. It is the hot pots that take a while. I think the broths are prepared with other orders because they all seem to come out all at once. Otherwise, good meal."
2,"This place is pretty slow and the service is okay. I thought it could have a bit quicker service. They  are out of silverware on the night I've come but they \""found some\"".  How does  that happen the bar is empty and there are not any patrons on the larger side. I may come back just to give it a second shot because you can't beat $35 for 2 margaritas an appetizer 2 entries and dessert."
1,"Rideflex is now Roadrunner Limo. I'm not sure which came first or if Roadrunner acquired Rideflex.\n\nI use this car service because it's substantially cheaper than other car service companies: $71 to PHX Sky Harbor versus like $90+ from other companies I received quotes from. I have an account with Roadrunner and use them on a regular basis when I travel. \n\nThey are never late which is awesome and always super polite. The cars are hit or miss: some are gorgeous and new and black and shiny and others kind of seem like taxi-cabs -- the lack of beautiful cars bothers me about Roadrunner. However, I do realize the price difference. \n\nSome of the drivers can be annoying and super chatty. I'm not really confrontational so I never ask them to be quiet. There are little luxurious missing like bottles of water.\n\nSometimes I've requested a towncar and the driver has showed up in a SUV. The driver told me it was a \""complimentary upgrade\"" but the SUVs aren't nearly as comfortable as the towncars.  \n\nI will continue to use them based on price but I'd might consider upgrading to a new company when I feel okay spending more money."
4,"Really enjoyed this place! My friends and I came here on our last night in Vegas and really had a great time. Great drinks and atmosphere. Pool, darts, and shuffleboard are all a great addition and tons of fun to play the more you drink. Really enjoyed the cheap drinks (compared to strip prices)!"
4,Mmmm donuts. How can you beat fried carby sweetness in the morning. There's a Dunkin Donuts by my office and it seems like once a week somebody stops in to pick up a dozen for the break room. \n\nI love that right now they have heart shaped donuts. Nice touch!
0,"After being reassured that their bankruptcy wouldn't effect them being open on our wedding day, and after taking $1300, we got word today that as of Oct 2nd the Goretorium will be CLOSED PERMANENTLY! We paid for our wedding which is only 4 weeks away and now we may not get our money back. There aren't words to describe how disappointed we are. We've been planning this for a year and now we have a few short weeks to find another place."
3,"There is only one reason why I didn't give 5 stars. I will explain at the very end of this review. \n\nMy husband and I have stayed at the W in our past travel including NYC, Hong Kong, Sydney and many more. Yes, we have always been a fan. However, on our recent trip to Montreal we almost opted out of staying at the W. We thought we would stay at a hotel more classic, less trendy sort of thing. So happy we stay true to our long term love. You are everything you claimed to be. Whenever, Whatever, and more......... \nThe main reason our experience was so wonderful at the W, Montreal can be describe by one word, The Staff!  They are so professional and helpful. \n\nWe check in and immediately got upgrade to this amazing loft apt style suite (starwood points! yeah!)\n\nConcierge recommandations on dining option (based on our taste) was point on! There was nothing we didn't enjoy in Montreal  and I must credit most of it to the staff at the W hotel. \n\n\n**** negative experience  at the \""Away Spa\"" (more like a constructive criticism)\n\nMy husband and I both decided to get a massage one afternoon to give ourselves a break from amazing food and shopping. My husband said his experience was up to par and mine was, hummm.....how should I put it  .... Terrible!!!! We had two different massage therapists. My therapist really do not know what she was doing. During the massage, I asked the therapist three times (politely) she can apply more pressure. She acknowledged but nothing happened! This is the only massage I ever had that made me feel worse after the treatment.  I felt very cheated by this particular therapist. She needs additional training!"
4,"Tied with Tattooed Moms in Philly for the best bar ever award! Just go... you won't be disappointed, and you won't need alot of money, either. Have some great bar food (the sexy fries will actually make you sexier..), free wi-fi (Spike!),  cheap happy hour drinks, and if you're a smoker you can light up at the adorable patio seating area outside (umbrellas!)...and remember to tip the staff well, they deserve it for always being friendly and unique.. it is a cash only establishment, so leave your plastic at home...Oh Madison how I miss you....= ^ {"
1,"The experience at Ian's Pizza is largely mediocre. Unless you're a drunk college student looking to satisfy a late night craving with a slice, it's not really worth going there. I went there tonight with my boyfriend and we ordered a 12\"" pie with some \""stix\"" on the side. We received the stix promptly, and they were alright. But almost 45 minutes after that, we still had not received our pizza. I went over to check if it would be ready soon, but it turned out that they hadn't even started it yet (somehow the cook never got the order). The cashier was very apologetic and offered us a refund on the pizza while they quickly made it, which is why I'm giving them two stars instead of one. The pizza itself is certainly not worthy of any praise and was definitely not worth the wait in the end."
4,"Wow. This place...is super good. Sometimes you just have to get a little off the strip to taste really good (and cheap!) food. Now first off, I'm from California..so the access to Mexican food is easy, but even with all the good places i've been to in L.A. and San Diego, I was blown away. It's a must to visit this place every time I go to Vegas."
3,"I like friendly Baristas!  Probably because I used to be one and know that if you're a friendly costumer you'll have a nice, smiling friendly Barista on the the other side of the counter.  At least, you should have!\n\nSo the Barista here, totally friendly!  We chatted for a bit while they were making my iced chai latte.  Chatting and coffee shops go together like cookies and milk.  You gotta have both to really enjoy the experience.  \n\nMy iced chai was up to my chai standards.  I knew right away it was the good chai concentrate and a great balance between the chai and milk.  They win, I win....we all win!\n\nThe coffee shop has a pretty large area to set up shop if you'd like to work or meet with a friend over coffee.  I can't wait for Bakery Square to grow so more people can enjoy this Coffee Tree location.  \n\nAnd next time, when I'm not in the chai mood, I'm ordering one of those \""gallon\"" iced green teas.  You may be peeing a lot after...but I'm sure it's totally worth it and refreshing!"
3,"All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).\n\nThis place was charmingly well worn around the edges, but it's mostly a standard American-Irish pub, with all the familiar bric-a-brac and beer taps.  I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \""Dark Bomb\""--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \""Irish Pancake\""--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \""Irish Hoe\""--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.  \n\nThis month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.\n\nThey had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.  We were the last patrons before closing at 2, and despite them sweeping and putting up chairs, nobody ever chased us out or even looked at us askance."
2,"For an AYCE sushi joint, this place delivers pretty well. Yes, they do offer Uni, and yes, it's obviously not as good as what you'd get at a traditional joint, but AYCE with an entire menu isn't bad at all. \n\nThe service was excellent. We had a big table (actually took up the entire Karaoke room. Yep, they've got one!) and there were two waitresses attentively serving us. \n\nThe tuna was fairly dry, but the yellowtail and salmon were both excellent in AYCE quality. It's Korean-owned, so they have some Korean plates to offer as well, on an AYCE basis. The one thing that stood out was the Duk bok gi. It was pretty damned good! I would come back here next time I'm around downtown, as it's the only tasty AYCE sushi place around..at least that I know of."
1,"Like so many Food Fight restaurants, this one banks on decor instead of serving good food. \n\nThe salsa bar is comprised of multiple mild, lifeless salsas. I know the average customer probably whines about spicy food, but if you label a salsa \""hot,\"" it should pack a punch.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how a place can also consistently produce dry tacos, but I've never gotten one at Tex Tubbs that wasn't dry.\n\nIn short, this is not the place to go for (Tex Mex) food. The margaritas are just fine and the place is cute enough if you want to meet friends for drinks and queso w/chips."
3,"Steaks are excellent, had exquisite wine pairings with our 3 course meal.  We thought everything was up to snuff.  The only drawback is the cost but for a once in a while romantic splurging special occasion (and you do only have that amazing anniversary that one time but that creative 29th birthday is over & over & over!!!!!)  \nThe location is in the Sunset Station Hotel which is ok but if you overindulge you can always do the affordable local special or for out of towners, stay frugally during the week Sun-Thursday."
3,good awesome fresh food. we ate at this place all the 4 days we stayed in las vegas. Good portion and quality food. awesome paneer tikka masala and naan bread. They say best bread! i would recommend.
1,"I don't see the big deal about this place.  The food is nothing spectacular, they don't really have any good drink specials.  Oh, and the service is horrible.  I went there twice and had bad service both times.  The wait times for a server to take a drink order are ridiculous and they don't like to come back and check on you.  The servers would rather hang out and talk to each other than take care of their customers.  I would recommend going elsewhere."
1,"What. a. bummer.\n\nHaving ordered the underwhelming panini last time, I was kinda excited to try their pasta.  But that dish, as well, was meh.   \n\nI ordered the aglo e olio, which is a basic pasta dish.  Generally, it's spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, and one can dress it up a little with parsley, chili flakes, or whatever.  I rarely put anything else - especially, since I heard that their pasta is all made in-house.  Pure pasta and nothing to hide its integrity - yum... or not.\n\nI thought homeboy had whipped up my dish a little too quick, and that was the case.  The spaghetti was undercooked and clumped together.  There I was trying to talk shop with some folks, and my lunch was difficult to eat.  Instead of normal bites of pasta, or trying to be high-class/fancy/sophisticated and getting nice spoonful portions of spaghetti together, it looked like I was trying to eat golf divots - just massive clumps.  I gave up after awhile as it no longer looked nor tasted particularly appetizing.  \n\nKinda relieved that our monthly lunch meetings are no longer going to be here.  It's for the best - some of us that order paninis get an alert thing so they can sit at the table and retrieve their panini when ready, while some of us have to stand at the pasta station until the food is ready.  Enough lost time that it's inconvenient when ordering different types of dishes.  \n\nFor those reason, three stars becomes two stars. Vapiano, if you're looking for more stars, they might just be buried in that mess of a spaghetti dish!\n\ndmo out"
1,I had the carnitas quesadilla and could not believe how small it was. The carnitas didn't have much flavor either.  \n\nThe bartenders also didn't know how to make a couple simple shots we requested so we ended up with a jager and cranberry concoction.
1,Where do i start ? Prepackaged pancakes or frozen french toast triangles.maybe its best to start at the mug of mud... I mean coffee. After dropping 40$ for my wife and i we were very disappointed and shocked at how subpar this breakfast buffet was. food quality is what i'd imagine prison food tastes like. The 2 stars are for the delicious orange juice(after the waiter finally brought it to us) along with the delicious bacon. I highly recommend any fastfood joint over this place. Im not sure how lunch or dinner is but luckily wont have to find out.
2,"I can't hate on consignment stores, because I think they serve such a great purpose on many levels.  My sisters closet is one of those stores I give the benefit of the doubt to, but unfortunately, just to much to say in regards to good and bad here.\n\nFor the good, they have a really nice selection of clothing.  Prices seemed reasonable and fair, and they had racks and racks and racks of everything here.  Shoes, purses, pants, suits, skirts, tops and blouses etc.  \n\nThe downer?  The entire store consisted of mostly smalls and medium sizes, with a handful of larges.  um, not everyone is a small.  I ended up chatting with another customer who was having the same difficulty as I was. Wheres the XL's?  Its all geared towards smaller sized individuals.  This is upsetting.  We both walked out empty handed because we are not medium sized gals.  Im not saying Im a fatty, but I cant possibly squeeze into a medium sized pant or top.\n\nIm upset about that, along side the fact that the parking lot here is a complete and udder disaster.  gravel, construction cones, dead end parking isles, and the so forth.  I dont hold my sisters closet responsible for that persay, BUT, it makes me more upset and frustrated when I want to support a place like this and I cant even get in and out within reason.  Driving in here is at best one car at a time.\n\nparking aside, I may or may not be back. They really need to bring in more reasonable sizes because Im not shopping at a place that doesnt carry my size."
2,"I didn't have a horrible experience here but it's a sports bar and honestly, I wouldn't have picked it. But I was out with family and this was a good place to go to for a pint after visiting some sights near by. \n\nThe service was good and the beer selection was OK. What I did like was the patio, which was airy and open. Despite being inclined to avoid all sports bars, I'm glad I came here in the middle of the afternoon instead of the evening. I have no idea about the food but I would assume that it's your typical sports bar fare."
1,"I am a huge fan of Drybar where I live in the east coast, and I wanted to treat my Mom to a blowout while I was home in Arizona for the holidays. Rather than having a special experience, however, we felt like we were inconveniencing the staff. \n\nNeither one of us had an actual stylist do our blowouts. Instead, the managers both attended to us after we had been waiting for over 20 minutes past our appointment time (and we had checked in at least 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment time). My mother's appointment started off with a stylist, but she literally walked away without saying anything and then a manager came and took over letting us know that the stylist was \""sick\"" (we later saw her attending to another client). \n\nBecause of the change in stylists, my mother did not have any product put in her hair and because she had never been to a drybar before, she didn't know to ask for any. As a result her blowout did not last. Perhaps I could understand the stylist changing mid-blowout if my mom was being rude, however, my mom was exhausted at that point and wasn't really talking - just trying to enjoy the experience. \n\nWhile the managers were lovely (and the gal who performed my blowout was 7 months pregnant so extra props to her for standing at that point) and made us look beautiful, it wasn't the special experience I was hoping for or have come to expect from Drybar and made what was supposed to be a fun afternoon anything but that."
4,"you have to try this place\nvery hole in the wall, hidden but well worth the find\nwas there this past April no reservations but still got into a cooking table\nthe cook Ray was very attentive to your choice of sauces, remind you the house sauce is just as good. they make the sauces right in front of you.\nif you like great food like me and watching it being prepared, this is the place\nyou will not be dissapointed\n\nask for Ray"
0,I can't speak for their cooked menu but the sushi is a disgrace here. I tried the most expensive roll - Las Vegas Roll for $18. It had no Nigiri and was full of imitation crab meat and what tasted like canned tuna.  My only mistake was finishing the roll instead of sending it back and walking away.  Manager offered no refund after I complained.  \n\nI'm literally astonished that they present this as upscale Sushi.
2,"After the five hour flight from New York we were STARVING! The gentleman that checked us in suggested The Grand Wok. So we dropped our bags in our room and rushed back down. It was a casual clean decor. The tables were kind of close for my comfort level. We heard all about the girls next to us \""Stupid boyfriends\"" but we were so hungry we didn't care. We started with the salt and pepper squid, one of our favorite things to get when we go our for Chinese in Flushing back home. It did not disappoint it was cooked perfectly tender and the fried garlic and diced chili toppings were just like corner 28 on Main Street. Chris ordered the roasted duck with peanut sauce. The skin had a great glaze to it, although it could have been a little crispier. The meat was excellently tender. I order two rolls that came out about twenty minutes after Chris' food. The waitress told us the sushi table was backed up. They should ave held off on his food so we could eat at the same time. We ended up sitting at lunch for almost two hours. Their was too much rice on the rolls for my taste. The fish was super fresh tasting but my avocado was a little too brown.  All in all everything was pretty good but we would not go back. There are far too many places on the strip to go back to one to eat separately."
0,"Would probably never come here again unless I absolutely had to.  Service was extremely poor, food was overpriced and not that great.  I had a veggie burger and fries which was okay.  Friends had nachos- the cheese on them was kind of funky but the toppings of beans, jalepenos, olives, etc were okay.\n\nOriginally we were going to get the appetizer platter but after hearing how many pieces of each item were on the platter, it was way to overpriced and didn't seem that great.\n\nGood: not much...standard cafe fare\nBad: service, price, food\n\nOverall: Like I said, I probably wouldn't come back here, it's really not worth it.  It is the only food place open late at TI but the menu is pretty limited.  Don't expect great service...I waited forever to get water refills!!"
1,I was so excited to give this local new place a try. The place is dark and urban but well done. The food was so average and they do not offer fish tacos... What a blunder.
1,"Food is terrible. Why did I eat here again?? Only bc its right next to the movie theater and I wanted to eat a quick dinner before watching Annabelle. Our cocktails sucked too. I ordered the flounder and the bf had salmon. He didnt like his food, my flounder was extremely dry and it was a struggle trying to chew and swallow it. Didnt even bother finishing the rest of my sides, they looked like theyd taste like cardboard. Gross food. Staff is ok."
3,"Clean, friendly and always convenient, this is a great location. I love subway, well actually I love subs no matter where they're from but subway is different, their sandwiches are supposedly healthy since the franchise is own by a bunch of doctors and if doctors know what's good for you then subway is the way to go but that's actually what kept me away for a while until I realized that it was  just a marketing  gimmick and That you can find unhealthy food with awesome taste like anywhere else  and it was then when I became a subway regular. My favorite is the Italian BMT with extra pepperoni, pepper Jack cheese and mayonnaise on white bread.  mmm mmm so good! Heart attack grill's got nothing on you babe! But if that's not you and you prefer something healthy you can certainly find that at subway, and here's the list.....\n                                                                      lettuce\n                                                                      tomato\n                                                                       onions..all that for five bucks!"
0,"I will never return to this store ever again. I had to come buy scrubs for my school uniform and they told us that there were none my size left and to return the following Friday at 12pm to get the right size. \""It will be here on Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday.\"" \""The shipment is really big, so I guarantee you that you will get your size if you come in then.\"" They said we weren't allowed to reserve my scrubs or leave my number to contact us. Here I am the following Friday to get my right size.. I'm here at 10am willing to wait for the shipment to come and they told us that it came in on Wednesday and that shipments always come then. They said all the other kids came to get the sizes as well and that they're all gone. The store is very far from my house and having to make that second trip wasn't what I wanted. Luckily they found my size buried under all the others, but the staff continued to argue with me. It was even better when it was the exact same staff that was working as my previous trip. They said \""why didn't you leave your number?\"" I asked if I can leave my number or if I can reserve it but they said it's policy that all uniforms are sold on a first come first serve basis. Very rude customer service!!!!! They continuously said that I heard wrong but I brought 2 others on my previous trip and I even put it in my calendar to come back FRIDAY AT 12PM!!! If you have to purchase a uniform that is sold at other places I HIGHLY recommend not to come to this store!"
4,The only place I can get my kids to be quiet for 5 min! Brisket is good mmmmmk!
4,Love love love the food here. Service is blah but it's take out!!!  Totally worth it.
0,"*** MUST READ *** **** MUST READ ***\n\nI honestly WISH I would have read the reviews before I went to try and get an apartment at Borgata. Worst experience of my life! I just wanna start off by saying FUCK ANNE AND ROBIN. Excuse the language but I am enraged. It all started when I got a call from Anne (leasing agent) sometime late August, she told me the apt I toured a few weeks earlier was going for a lower price and to come put a hold on it if I was still interested. I ended up going the next day because I was desperate for an apartment and put $270 down to hold it. Me and my girlfriend filled out some paper work that same day and like the review below me says, she will blow your phone up!! The old hag is annoying! Every little thing she would call, most of the time she called because of some papers she forgot to have us sign. I swear we came up to the office 3-4 different times because of their mistakes and it got to the point I just let the calls go to voicemail. She was verrrrrry unprofessional and sooooooo inconsiderate knowing I had to go to work. So a few days go by and they already start giving us a hard time, long story short it took weeks for us to get them to do a job verification because of some issues they were having with my gfs job. At one point we almost backed out because of all the shit we were going through and my gf straight up told Robin (manager) to cancel her application. A few days later I called and told her NEVERMIND that we are still going through with it! After that they tell me everything is going good and they were gonna finallllllly run our credit! A week goes by and here we were waiting for a phone call to find out if we got approved on the credit check, but I never got one so I called asking Anne if we got approved or not and when would be a good time to come sign the lease, she responded by saying she didn't know, all the paper work and information was in Robins office and she was gone for the day. Sooo another few days go by and I ended up calling this morning and spoke with Robin and guess what I found out ?! I got approved and my gf got denied. I just wanna know WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING US ROBIN!? She basically told us not to worry that she was gonna have a phone meeting with her boss and she would let us know if we would still be able to move in. She called me later that day and said we would be all good to move in Saturday but the grand total we had to pay was around $1,100 ARE YOU CRAZY? She said it was $300 extra because she didn't get approved! No way way in hellllllll we were gonna pay that much to move into some apartments, specially not one that had such a horrible staff. I called right back after she gave me the news and told her we are definitely not moving in. I asked about getting the $270 deposit back and as soon as I heard \""no\"" we aren't able to get that back I instantly hung up on the bitch. Both Anne and Robin need to be fired if you ask me. They wasted so much of our time and money and at the end of it all we have less than a week to find a new apartment!!! Honestly I just don't want anybody to go through what we went through so I took the time to write this long review! Thank you if you took the time to read it all.. Hopefully it keeps many people AWAY from this place."
3,One of the better Chinese restaurants in the UNC area. Sunday buffet and dailey drink specials. 1/2 price rolls on Mondays.
2,"I was just there last Friday; heard they are under new ownership. Great tapas, decent wine. Just need to add one more waitress and bartender to the Friday night staff. \n\nOh, great music, too."
1,"Ok so I get the fact that they are suppose to be healthy and fresh but $8 for a juice? That's crazy and it wasn't even good. There are a couple other places that this place mimics just down the street, I think I'll only go to one of them from one on."
1,"Asked for salmon cream cheese got plain; asked for a blueberry muffin, got banana, and told them we were eating there and got it to go. Rediculous."
4,"I was looking for a reasonably priced place to get a pedicure since the weather is getting warmer. This place had good reviews and was conveniently located, so I decided to give it a shot. They take reservations and walk-ins. There was only one other customer there when I went, so I was helped right away. The pedicure was well done and the woman who did it was very nice. They even give you a shoulder massage while your nails dry! They only charge $22 for a pedicure and have a very clean salon. I will definitely be coming back here!"
4,"Friendly staff (of they are from Pittsburgh!!!) After parking my car after I dropped it off, they pulled it back out of the garage and drove me to the Megabus pickup site at the Convention. Also the weekend rate $9.99/day was SO WORTH IT!!!"
2,"Something's wrong.  I'm not sure if its because we went towards the end of the night last time or what, but the pizzas weren't the same.  The crusts were a bit thicker and not crisp, and it didn't have much of the coal-fired flavor.  The red pizza came out bland and the white garlic came out salty.  I'm hoping it was just an off-night because usually the pizza is pretty good."
0,"I am a steakhouse regular.  It is the only food I really like and so I know what to expect for what kind of money.  This place is not worth the money.  I am not saying they are over priced...the area, the clientele and the overall perception of the place warrants a higher priced dining experience...what I am saying is Capital Grille does not belong in this arena.  \n\nThe visit was disappointing at best.  My husband and I showed 15 minutes early and got seated quickly...good!  \n\nWe ordered a drink and when they arrived ordered app.'s and entree's at the same time.  We had some bread with our drinks while waiting for app.'s...the table got \""crumby\"" and you would expect that in this type of restaurant they would pull out their handy-dandy table scrappers...nope...I just kept sweeping it to the egde...whatever!  As a matter if fact, no one attempted to clear glasses, plates...I had to make eye contact with them and kind of \""offer\"" to give them what I wanted off the table...HORRIBLE!!!  \n\nSo, the app.'s arrive and they are sub standard...I ordered a capese like app. (Beefsteak Tomato -Mozzarella cheese- Basil)..the point is the Tomato...they're the point of the dish...they were Green and not even close to ripe..ok...whatever...I eat around it basically.  My husband had Oysters...no crackers and had to beg for Tabasco...ok...we move forward...1 full hour went by before our server finally said they were having trouble in the kitchen...could they buy us a drink to tide us over.  I said no but only because we were headed for drinks afterwards and I really didn't want to end up wasted.  5 minutes later...he shows with drinks and says they are compliments of the manager as they know we have been waiting.  At this point my husband and I are not off the wall pissed but we're getting tired of sitting there and are hungry to boot...now add more alcohol.....DISASTER!\n\nSo, food finally arrives..I ordered the filet medium well...came Red...didn't bother to send it back...ate half and called it a day.  My husband ordered the Ribeye...it was just plain fat.  Now, it is a steak that needs fat to taste as good as it does...but this, again, was sub standard.  He had to cut awat 1/2 of it to get to decent meat!  \nHere comes the kicker...\n\nWe pay our bill and get out of there (no manager ever came to the table to apologize for the crap visit)...\n\nWe go to the bar that we were meeting people at and my husband starts to feel \""funky\"" and not in a good way!!  He was telling the people in our party about Capital Grille when one of them says. \""I should have called Health and Sanitation on them last time I was there...I got food poisioning from my dinner\"".  That was it...!!  We ended up leaving and going home where my husband proceeded to get sick...ALL NIGHT LONG!!!  Horrible visit ...terribly disappointing...and obviously charging way too much money for sub standard food...!  It was like a bait and switch with out the actual advertising how high end the meat is...its assumed that its higher end at $40-$50 a piece...well not by me.  DONE!  Wouldn't go back here for FREE!!!!!  We have always been fans of Mastro's Steakhouse and only went here because someone gave us a gift certificate...WE\""RE STICKING WITH MASTRO'S...You get what you pay for there and EVERYTHING IS A PLUS-TOP OF THE LINE!!"
1,Average chain... really nice outdoor area - really average food.
4,"Agree with everybody who gave 5 stars: \""The BEST Japanese food in Arizona.\"" \""It's a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.\"" \n\nThey provide good size portions and are inexpensive.  I like the katsudon."
1,"Not impressed. Man I really wanted to like this place. Guy seems to know food but I guess when you just franchise your name and don't bother with the follow up...\n\nWe ordered burgers. When I told the guy I wanted mine medium, he said: we cook them medium well. \n\nWhat???!!!???\n\nIt's cooked smash style. So a medium-well smashed burger. Dry. Loaded with toppings that do nothing but confuse your mouth. We were seated outside along with the only flies that exist in the entire state. And the loud day-drunk tunes coming from the midway club Carnavale. What a joke. \n\nOverpriced,  overhyped,  not really worth it."
0,"I visited their new location in The Village (1654 rue Sainte-Catherine East) and experienced the most terrible dining ever.  S L O W service, mixed-up orders, miniscule portions, exorbitant prices.  There is no reason to ever eat here."
1,Went to this FedEx and received horrible customer service. I realize my packing job wasn't perfect but the tone of voice and attitude of the employee was very condescending. She made me feel like an idiot for packing my own products. I am huge believer in good customer service with a smile. There was even an older gentleman in line before me and I could tell she made him feel very uncomfortable. The only reason I give this location 2 stars is because the other employee there was nice to me. If you're looking to ship something by FedEx you might want to go to another location.
4,"Napoletana pizza at it's finest - I would recommend ordering the Settebello pizza and sharing the Insalate Grande - Most ingredients are from Italy,  that is what sets this pizza apart from any other! Even the chefs were flown over from Italy! Thin crust and they don't slice it for you - just like in Italy- fold and enjoy! (unless you request it sliced).  This is certified Napoli Pizza - hard to find just anywhere!  The staff is attentive and happy!  They have a happy hour at the bar M-F 3-6PM $5 mini pizzas and apps. 2 for 1 drinks!  Great location - just off the 215 Fwy."
1,"The basics: Stay somewhere else.  \n\nThe details:  \nResort fee?  For what? Could be more appropriately labled wired internet fee.  No wireless internet available.\n\nRooms/property is very old, rundown. Mold in the shower, carpets soiled and \""coming up.\""\n\nThe rooms are very hot.  This is July and the A/C unit simply cannot keep the room cool. \n\nNo ammentities, not even an in room coffee maker.  \n\nStay somewhere else."
4,"Awesome Spot. I was in town for Spring Training and happened by this place. don't ask me what I was doing in this part of town, I plead the fifth!"
0,"You would have thought I'd know better with all the bad reviews. This was a package deal to Las Vegas. Hotel experience at MGM was great but Spirit was the worst. Four hour delay at oakland and at check in was told flight home would be an hour late. Lots of charges, check bags, carry on and $10 for a boarding pass. \nI had to give it 1 star because Yelp won't allow 0."
0,"The service at this place was absolutely awful. The waitresses were quick and snarky and left if we couldn't get our orders in. We ordered bottle service and were still treated terribly by the entire staff. And to top it all off, we paid in cash and they STILL DOUBLE CHARGED MY FRIEND'S CREDIT CARD AND WON'T REDACT THE CHARGES. Now we're going to have to open up a case because these people can't count. Do not recommend."
0,"They started out great, attentive, then somewhere along the way service spiraled down. Was steered in wrong direction and am now facing a high dollar repair. Towards the end keeping an appointment was becoming difficult, keeping up on service didn't even seem like a concern.  Many opinions vary on pool maintenance so I took their opinion only to realize maybe their is a difference between adding chemicals and skimming a pool,  and exactly knowing how to care for a pool and extending its lifespan."
4,"Wife and I split the lettuce wrap appetizer and we each had a stir fry for lunch.  Fresh veggies, she had tasty seafood and I had scallion lamb, both excellent.  Great ambiance and impeccable service.  We expect to return many times."
4,I am very happy I stumbled upon Puff Vapors! Conrad and the staff are very knowledgeable on the subject of vapors! Definitely check this place out first before going anywhere else. The prices are right and all your questions will be answered.
4,"the absolute BEST mexican food in the area! always come here when i land its a must! every other place you have to be careful about, this place 100% authentic! AMAZING GREAT yumm!!"
3,We were there on a cloudy and cold memorial day weekend. We showd up around 2 and the place was packed with the most beautiful people in Vegas!\n\nI mean these girls were all HOT and the guys all tanned and buff....\n\nWe saw that the wait was a 3 hour wait and decided to come back another day....looked like a great time!
4,Absolutely amazing.. impeccable food and view.. I love this place. One of my top three in vegas.
2,It was decent and fun to have this asian fusion of a menu.  I met here with old friend's from college. The server was great. The drinks delicious.  I got a yelp free welcome drink. That was a plus.\n\nThe food was decent. But it wasn't high end enough or commercialized enough to get a 4 star.  If it was more commercialized and outlandish it would be a novelty type place. If it was chic-er it could be considered upscale.\n\nThe food could have been good for either. But the ambiance for me made it a bit not either...\n\nFood: decent\nWaitstaff: good\nAmbiance: confused....\n\nThis is like a 3.5 for me...
4,Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.
2,"This is a newer casino in the northwest area of Las Vegas.  It has an odd decor to me, seems kind of 70ish with tons of brown and orange.  Everything old in new again I suppose.\n\n They have an Original Pancake House, TGIFridays, Buffet, some sort of mexican place, MRKT, a winebar and ETA lounge.  They also have a food court with things like pizza and a Johnny Rockets.  \n\nAlso attached is a huge Regal Theater.  I like that if you order a pizza from them they give you a little buzzer and bring it straight to your show when it's ready.  What I didn't like about it was they refused to take my Entertainment Book coupon for tickets.  Also the menu is on a moving screen, and it can get annoying when your trying to look at it and it changes to a movie preview.  Really?  WTF?\n\nI also find that Aliante sends me tons of coupons for 2-for-1 buffets, meals, and free slot play, and honestly I don't gamble all that much to deserve such freebies.  Over all it's a nice place.  It's not my favorite Station Casino, but it's nice and right off the 2-15, so it's easy to find."
4,"Thank you Johnny for being a part of our special day and for having the perfect wedding rings, which are one of a kinds, just for us! \n\nThanks also to the other customers that left comments about their experiences, because that is how we found this little gem of a shop, like it was called in another post. \n\nJohnny was honest and no pressure. He asked what we wanted to spend, what we had in mind, and didn't mind when I said that I didn't like something. He said, then let's find you something you do like, lol. I also found out his wife's name is the same as mine. I felt this was meant to be, to have found his store and to then have found the exact pieces that I had hoped for, but truly didn't think I would ever find. This was our first trip to any jewelry store, we hadn't even looked at home. I definitely recommend that you visit Johnny if you are an out of towner or a local. I am a jewelry snob and I couldn't be more pleased with the entire experience :) Thank you!!"
0,"Got connected to this company through home warranty company.  A/C stopped working in July in AZ.  Pretty much all of the negative reviews are spot on.  He doesn't return calls, says he is going to do something and then doesn't do it and then tells me that  my coils are dirty and home warranty wont cover it.  How could he determine that without even climbing up in the attic and looking at it.  He would clean them for me, though, for 900 bucks a unit.  Are you kidding me?  This is not a complex repair / project.  In any event, I would not recommend this company at all.  There are way too many other companies out there to \""settle\"" for this dog."
2,"Review based on restaurant BRUNCH service on a Sunday afternoon at 12 PM.\n\nI was lured in by the Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and ended up getting the Pre Fixe $20 brunch menu which includes an app, main course, and dessert. Honestly I should have just gotten the cinnamon roll and been done with it because I definitely did not need to eat that much food.\n\nMy friend and I were seated quickly, especially since there was hardly anyone else in the place. I will say that's okay because on The Strip most people are probably still sleeping of their hangovers at Noon on a Sunday. Our waitress quickly greeted us and took our drink order of two coffees. She was a very nice girl, although a bit spacey about coming around to check on us as our coffees got cold during the meal and had to be replaced with new ones.\n\nOn to the meals. I got the Pre Fixe. Started with the cinnamon roll that comes with a side of pork belly (picture added). I must say it did not disappoint me, it was decadent and delicious. I did not eat all of it for fear I would never be able to finish the rest of my meal. On to the quiche du jour, which that day was bacon, spinach, and cheese. I must say the quiche was undeniably delicious. It was perfectly cooked with a flaky pastry crust. It was not heavy, nor was it too light. The spinach was perfect and addicting. And lastly I somehow managed to have a few bites of my profiteroles. They were perfectly served with drizzled chocolate sauce and outstanding ice creams which are made on-site. The pistachio was definitely my favorite.\n\nSo everything was delicious correct? Correct. Unfortunately the service was lackluster. Two coffees getting cold over and over again is just not a good sign. Especially when the restaurant is so empty! And lastly, as it must be mentioned my friend ordered the Ox Tail Eggs Benedict and alas, somehow, someway they left out the Ox Tail! How is that possible? I have no idea.\n\nI do love Comme Ca and I have written glowing reviews in the past. However, my first dining experience was not the best. I will not rule them out though because the food was very good and I enjoy their bar and cocktail happy hours. I will try it again because I still want to try their famous hamburger. I just hope service is a bit better next time."
3,"I have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade, and have always had a very good experience, so am baffled by the negativity. Food is SO much better than Carrabas, Olive Garden, etc., I don't know if locals don't know good Italian food when they taste it (I'm from Boston, which has many great Italian restaurants), or if it's a weekend problem (I almost never eat out on weekends, since service is always worse on busy nights at any restaurant). We went Wednesday for my birthday, and it was great; the Italian nachos appetizer was one of the tastiest dishes I have had in last few years, and the bill was less than I anticipated. My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte, not a 5 star Chicago/NY/Boston restaurant, but it is very good for the money, and I heartily recommend it."
3,"Great food, their ribs were excellent and I will be back for more of their awesome BBQ. Sauces were good too, and everything was BBQ'ed nicely. The staff could be a bit more polite, courteous, and attentive , but don't let that stray you away for their food - it's some of the best BBQ in the valley hands down."
3,"So I am not big on coffee, but I got the two scoops of gelato with espresso poured over it.  Dangerously delicious."
0,"This government office gets an F for being handicap accessible. The parking does not provide enough van spaces. Several able-bodied people were parking in the available spots with no placard. The ramp was too steep and the door had no way to open automatically. Still waiting in the initial check-in line, so perhaps the verdict on the rest of their services will be different."
0,"I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to food service, but the service here was exceptionally slow.  It was not like all the tables were filled or anything, it was just the service.  It took quite a long time for the waitress to take my order, then a longer time to get my food.\n\nFinally I actually kept track of how long things were taking, and from the time I requested my check till the time I was able to get the check and get out was 20 minutes.\n\nI think the only thing I saw that was quick, was when she finally came to pick up the check from me."
3,"I decided to go back and give I Love Yogurt another try.  I still don't care for the white interior.  It's a personal taste, and since I don't eat inside that often at any Yogurt place, I can get by this.\n\nI tried the Red Velvet and Pistachio flavors.  I added three toppings--cookie dough chunks, coconut, and mochi.  I was impressed by  both flavors.  They were very flavorful and creamy.\n\nMy big problem tonight was there were so many flavors I wanted to try, but I couldn't try all of them.  This means, I'll have to come back.  Since this is about the closest serve yourself frozen yogurt to where I live, I guess that' what I'll have to do.  And, after visiting Pinkberry's in downtown LA this week, I know more than ever why I prefer self-serve rather than we'll do it for you.\n\nNote to fellow Yelpers:  After 3 check ins here, there's a 25% discount.  I think I'll reach that plateau quickly.  \n\nI'm glad to see I Love Yogurt has made some changes with their flavors and their operation."
2,"We've always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here.  But on this particular occasion, when of course I was introducing the restaurant to two friends, the wheels of service largely came off the tracks.  We had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing Strip hotels across the street, but it wasn't ready when we arrived.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a booth to be cleared, which was no big deal.  But it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night.\n\nFor starters, I ordered Calamari Fritte and Crab & Shrimp Imperial, a special of the day.  I also ordered a cup of Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup and a side of Caesar Salad before my entree of Linguine & Clams.  Bread arrived first, which was good and crusty.  But our Iced Teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until 10 minutes after the presentation of bread, EVO, and butter.  And, one soft drink was missing.  So were two of four bread plates and a knife.  \n\nSoon afterward, the appetizers arrived.  Unfortunately, so did both my soup and salad.  Four items were plopped on the table at the same time--all of them mine.  Although jammed up with food, I did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold, and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home.  The Crab & Shrimp Imperial, consisting of Crab-stuffed Lobster with Herb Bread Crumbs and Lobster Cream Sauce over Orzo pasta, was simply excellent.  It was also very filling.  The deep-fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked, but still fairly tasty--especially dipped in the Lemon Aioli that was prepared on request.  The accompanying Marinara Sauce was also good and mellow.  \n\nAs before, the Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup did not disappoint.  The fennel-flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage, fresh tomatoes, celery, and white beans.  The side of Caesar Salad was a generous helping of cool and crisp Romaine greens with Focaccia Croutons and grated Parmesan Cheese.  Linguine & Clams with invisible but tasty White Clam Sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams.  But, unfortunately, only 7 fresh clams were present, which not only seemed meager but were far less than I had enjoyed on a previous occasion.  And, I bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix.   \n\nGarlic Bread Focaccia was not very garlicky at all.  And, inexplicably, the cheesy Fontina Potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until 20 minutes beyond the third of three promises of \""2 minutes longer\"" by our server, just AFTER our packaged leftovers had been handed to us.  Obviously, we didn't want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises.  After an apology by our server that seemed sincere, the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge.\n\nThe quality of ingredients and tastiness of what I ate were mostly sound as always.  And, kudos and an extra 1/2-star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing Kindle had been found on the floor of our booth, before I raced back to retrieve it right after midnight.  So, 3-1/2 stars on an off night."
4,"We were very excited to try Chef Longest's food after watching her win Restaurant Express. We loved everything. We tried several of the appetizers and side dishes. Our favorites were the Street Tacos, Duck Sliders and especially the Crab Salad. We will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas!!!"
3,"Yea!!! I love this place :) They have great deals on produce and other food items. It doesn't have the widest variety, but I'd rather go here than anywhere else to shop. I'll try to change my menu so I don't have to go other places. I'm one of those people that loathes grocery shopping, but I like to go here. You have self check out, it's not busy and things are displayed nicely so you can see the prices and know what you're getting. Definitely a fan, I will only go to other stores if they don't have things that I need here :) Plus, they have a place you can drop off cans, plastic bags and plastic bottles to be recycled. I wish they took glass too!"
2,Neighborhood sushi restaurant that is family owned. I have been here a handful of times and it is good but not great. Rolls are unique with fun names but a bit overpriced for what you get. I love yellowtail and it is always amazing here. Service is slow but I get it when it is just one person waiting on the whole place. The salads are great here as well. Owner is always nice and chatty when you come in. Overall good place to come when I dont feel like driving to my two favorite sushi restaurants.
2,"Went here last weekend and had a vegi burrito, it was okay except I felt like they used some random vegis that didnt blend well. The burrito was also bland not much salsa or taste had to drench it in tobasco."
3,"Bartenders are excellent. They flip bottles, perform magic tricks are attentive and make the out of town visitors feel at home. Crazy Mike is crazy and awesome. Food was good, not awesome, but good in general, and the prices are on par."
2,"I liked the experience but amidst the performance the show came to a halt. The ushers informed us that it was some type of safety mechanism that stops the performance to prevent a mishap. With that said, this whole issue that lasted a good 30 mins brought the overall review down a peg or two."
2,"Ate there with a large group while visiting LV for a conference. \nFirst the food: our dinner was great! Started with the escargot and oysters both of which were very tasty. The escargot was cooked well, not chewy or rubbery but soft,  and delicate. I ordered the steak tartare (come on raw steak, all i can say is yes. . .) it was wonderful, meaty and served with pickles and a whole grain mustard, oh and let's not forget the gems on the plate. the pickled pearl onions, I would have eaten a pound of them if i could. \nthat being said lets talk about the way you get seated. regardless of your reservation time you have to stand in a line waiting for seating. this makes NO sense what so ever. It is an issue that can easily be corrected by placing a hostess stand outside the restaurant, oh wait they have one of those but all they do is say ok now you have to stand in line and check in. So why are they there? No reason from what i can surmise. So we got into line 15 min before our 8 pm reservation. we finally got seated at 9pm! This is an issue that could easily be solved by giving the hostesses standing outside the restaurant the ability to check in people with reservations instead of standing in line. You charge top $$ for food but are the worst at organization of your seating. I will NOT be going back for this reason. there are similar restaurants with similar food with better organization. \n \nJust be warned if you go make sure you get in line and you MAY get seated around your reservation time."
1,"I had heard about this place from a few people...all who loved it. I didn't want to review it after my first dinner there because I was sure it was a fluke. After the second visit I realized there wouldn't be a third visit.\n\nThe first time they were short handed in the kitchen. The food took a long time. But it was good, the risotto- fantastic. Also, the service was okay...nothing spectacular but not the worst I've had.\n\nThe second time they were short handed in the front of house. The service was appalling. My water only refilled once...we could never catch our server to get another glass of wine. Only 1 employee...a busboy...showed any desire to be at work. At one point the hostess was chatting with the people at the next table and then showed off her newest tattoo on the shoulder blade. The food was mediocre. Oh and the fabulous risotto? It is only offered with the special.\n\nOh and don't plan on spending less than 2.5 hours for dinner with no dessert."
3,"Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!! \nI love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer! \nThis place has always been super friendly!!\n As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!! \n:)  Hope you enjoy it!!!"
1,"I had a friend come in from out of town and I wanted him to have the best/authentic Mexican food.  I asked a friend who lives in and is from Tempe, where I could take my out of town friend to get such food.  He said \""Amados\"".  Since I trust this friends taste in food, I trusted he was right.  Ohhhh was he wrong.\n\nFirst there is only like 4 parking spots, and the drive-thru would be hard to maneuver thru if the parking lot was actually full.  When we walked in, it looked dirty, and like the place hadn't had the floors mopped in days.  I got the chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole.  Mind you, I paid about $2.50 for extra guacamole since I'm a guacamole nut.  When our food was ready, there was some liquid green stuff on my burrito and liquid green stuff in a cup that I could only assume was the guac.  First, the small cup they charged me for wasn't even worth the extra $$ I paid.  Second, the guac was horrible.  It should not be liquid; I understand that some may not like it lumpy, but IT SHOULD NOT POUR!!  I figured I needed to have an open mind, I mean, my friend that recommended it never stopped raving about the place.  As I cut into my burrito, it was liquid on the inside.  It wasn't grease, it was like the water from boiled chicken; which the chicken had a funny taste to it.  I also believe for what I got, it was way overpriced.\n\nThe bar that had extra salsa, carrots, etc I would not touch with a ten foot pole since it looked like it had been sitting there for hours and not changed out (it was on a mobile cart that had a broken leg).  Not once did any worker come out to check on the extra bar items. \n\nI'm only giving it a second star because the burrito was big and filling.  That's it. \n\nWhen I asked my friend why the hell he recommended it, he said because its open 24 hours, and late at night, its the best food to get.  I'm sorry, but I'd rather go to Denny's."
4,"I've been looking for a great carwash here in Las Vegas ever since moving from LA 6 months ago. So-called \""hand\"" car wash places I've found so far are no more than a quick rub on your exterior followed by a push through those god aweful automated machines that leave a semi-ok wash. This place on the other hand is amazing, when they say 100% hand they mean 100% HAND, no machines, no mass produced quick pushthrough get 'em in and get 'em out service here. True professionals. And your car comes out super clean and nearly showroom quality. It may be a bit of a trek to get to, but considering the reasonable price you pay for such quality work it's worth the extra drive to get here and check them out."
4,One of the best meals I have ever had. We have wanted to try Olives for a long time and just never had made it here before on trips to Las Vegas. The pasta was handmade and melted in your mouth. The entire meal was perfection.
0,When we got there the place was empty and the first thing the receptionist asks is if we have a reservation.  Really?  2 hour wait for our food and they seated us in the lounge. I guess we just didn't meet there high standards. Anyone else who wants to go there better impress the staff to start if they expect a nice evening.
0,"I had this Company move my Family the end of July 2011. The owner at first was a great help to my family and allowed me to pay half in cash and the remainder by check, which was great. However that was the end of anything considered positive. He sent 3 guys that complained about the move and was certain as they walked in only 1 room of my home that it was to a 8hr job, when I was quoted half that. Long story short 9hrs later after they had milked the clock all they could. We began to beg the movers to finish getting our belongings off of the moving truck, as everything was just being unloaded into our garage the entire day except the large items such as sofas and TVs that they reluctantly place in the house. Our cream colored sofa has a large black greasy hand print (that we can't get out) on it. The day had dragged on so long because the pace they had set from the beginning. My youngest son even had to overhear one of the movers say \"" This is Bullsh*t\"". It took well over 90 minutes for the drive between houses which is normal about 20 minuet drive. The 3 of the movers had several instances where they were in our garage on their cell phones. The entire 9 hours our entire family helped by moving boxes to the driveway as a staging area. Prior to the movers' arrival we had everything Taken apart (Beds, ECT) and placed in 2 rooms, but it still did not speed up the process at all! It got so bad about 5 hours in that it was oblivious by the way they were loading the Box truck with all the unused space they left. That they were also going to try to get the move to take longer with excess trips having to be made between the homes. So to speed up the process, as a last resort we went and got a flatbed trailer and packed that up ourselves. I was very upset by this point because I had requested for 3 movers and a VERY large truck, and 9+hours later and they want to charge $800.00 (which is NOT at all reasonable for what they did, let alone the damage cost I incurred that day) so I paid $200.00 in cash the day of the move hoping we could speak to the owner about the blatant milking of time during the move and the damages caused by his movers. They didn't even bring hardly anything in the house let alone assemble anything; we had to do 2 loads on our own. We felt horrible on our moving day we were up that day from 5:00am to 10:00pm and was exhausted. I thought the reason you hire movers is to lessen the emotional and Physical strain of moving rather than doing it yourself.   As they unloaded the moving truck boxes were dropped which as you can see from his email below, the owner blames our packing. (Even though we used bubble wrap on anything breakable and also we marked FRAGILE clearly visible on all boxes that were breakable) It could not possibly be his movers poor handling and complete disregard of our items, one of my large decorative trees was knocked over and the setting it was in knocked loose and all the topping in the pot spilled onto the sidewalk and not one of the movers attempted to pick it up, my sons had too. As we began to notice damages throughout the day like the sofa we called and talked to DAVE the owner and he had completely dismissed us. So after this horrific day we called Dave again about the damages still no concern if we even got a response. I did not receive a decent response until I had to place a stop -pay on the remainder of the payment for the move. At that point it seems I had gotten Dave's attention in a negative way because not only did he write the email in regards to the pictures of our damages that I have included below, but threatened the file criminal charges for writing a bad check and for theft of services. When we could have solved this situation civilly or through small claims and I was fine with either. Throughout all of this it got so bad that the owner even called my wife a Bit*h and began calling me that my family  \"" White Tra*h! \"" type of racial slurs. I'm just hoping to keep someone's family from having to do business with someone like this; I wish I could have known.....\n\n\nSee his email... In response I am not comfortable in fixing my furniture with a marker! I ask would you?\nI do have a group on facebook , with more infomation just search company name in groups"
4,"I love these guys. Went here on a whim to get my friend an oil change for her car and they were super friendly and fast. There prices were a good $10 less than at the dealership. My Grandma took her Highlander over there because the dealership quoted her $700 for a brake job and a new battery, and Just Brakes got it done for just under $300, with the battery. Last but not least, I brought in my car for a check up before going on a long road trip and they even rotated my tires, all at no cost. These guys dont get the credit they deserve in some of these reviews. You won't be sorry if you go see them for your basic brakes and car maintenance."
3,"I'm always on the lookout for a good eat in North Las Vegas...and Sun Thai will be my go to spot to satisfy my Thai cravings.  Small mom and pop shop, we were only ones dining there, but we did notice quite a few people picking up to go orders.  We started off with the stuffed fried chicken wings (deboned chicken leaving just the skin and wing tip and filled with ground pork, vermicelli, veggies), and this dish was surprisingly tasty but a tad on the salty side....nothing a few bites of rice can't neutralize.  Honestly, it's not the best Thai ever but the Thai fried rice was comparable to Archi's and the dish was fairly large.  The fried rice was my favorite dish, the rice had the right texture and flavor.  We also ordered the garlic and pepper chicken...which had good flavor but perhaps was slightly overcooked and the portion was rather small.  The service was very attentive and the server always had a smile on her face.  Definitely give it a try if you live in North Las Vegas...well since you really don't have too many other options :)"
2,"I don't know if it's because this place is newer than the older LV location, and not polished yet but execution was poor...\n\nI had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great.\n\nMy friend, had a egg dish and asked for whites... but they messed that one up too...\n\nMy other friend had the banana and brown sugar pancake, and it was marvelous! You don't even need the syrup!\n\nThe food was awesome overall.\n\nThe biscuits were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend noticed a little metal jar, next to the sugar, salt and pepper shakers, and discovered a wonderful blackberry chutney (jam) and it accompanied the biscuit wonderfully! Would've been nice if the waitress mentioned it...\n\nThe mashed potatos with skin were great as well, perfectly seasoned, we didn't have to add anything to it.\n\nThe sage chicken is OMG good, although I would probably go with the chicken and waffles next time, cause I think the sauce on the benny, although good, was overwhelming... maybe if they used half the amount, I would've ate the whole thing.\n\nThe amount of food they give you is like \""hungry man\"" portions, and value, is well worth every penny! The only other complaint I have, other than the miscommunication between the order and chef was the feel of being hurried in a sense...\nThe portions are huge, so the group had about half of their dish left. Every 3 mins, it seemed one staff member or another lliked to come by and ask if we were done... let me tell, I was chewing my food still!!! also instead of asking us, if we wanted to-go boxes, they just took it away, when we said we were done... Now, perhaps it was our fault that we didnt say anything, but I thought it would've been courteous and nice to have been asked...\n\nSo, I would give this place 5 stars for the food, when they get it right, and minus 2 stars when they are off, and in this visit they were off."
1,"The $12 Monday night Prime Rib special will pull you in. Don't believe the hype.\n\nBF is a huge prime rib fan, and when I stumbled across this place i thought I'd struck gold and found a Monday night that fit our schedules to bring him in for a surprise date night. And my carefully-laid plans bombed.\n\nPlaced his order for the prime rib special with mashed potatoes, bummed to hear it does not come with a vegetable despite many mentions in other reviews and pictures here of a veggie side. Waitress told us a side would set us back $2- for bar veggies? No thanks. My order was for the 10oz NY, which did come with a veggie, mashed potatoes as a side as well. Both of us added on a side salad for $1 extra, with bleu cheese dressing.\n\nNow, if the first element of your meal is a side salad, and you are unable to finish it, that's probably a bad sign. The salad itself was fine and decently fresh but the dressing had seen better days- it neither smelled nor tasted like and bleu cheese dressing I've ever had in my life, and we couldn't put our finger on whether it was supposed to be a yogurt-based ranch dressing, or if it was spoiled.\nWaitress cleared our still-full salad bowls in confusion, and when we mentioned that the dressing was off/funky, all she had to say was, \""Well it came straight from the bottle.\"" Um, then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle.\n\nThen our entrees were brought out. BF's rare prime rib was medium rare only in the middle, and easily 1/3rd of it was fat while another 1/3rd of it appeared to be brown in color and possibly spoiled.  It tasted like more of a roast than any prime rib I've ever had.\nMy steak also had a good 1/3rd of the meat consisting of fat, and not even just around the edges of the steak itself but globs of fat within the middle of the steak- very, very low quality meat. I know my expectations for bar food are low, but come on ...\n\nFor a $30 meal, we literally ate about 1/5 of his prime rib (we were put off by the rest of it), and maybe 2/3rd of my steak, plus the broccoli and potatoes. Not really the value it's advertised as.\nOn top of that, we barely made it to the car before our stomachs started hurting.\n\nTo end on a positive note, our waitress was super friendly and sweet, though I'm a little perturbed that she didn't offer a solution or even begin to address the quality issues with our meal. That being said, she's a server and not a manager or in charge of who is selected as a supplier, so she's not really the one to discuss those matters with any way. Considering we had maybe five bites of our salads, I expected them to be removed from our bill- even if it was only a measley $2.\n\nOnly redeeming factor of our meal was the beer my BF ordered- it was a JW Dundee Nut Brown Ale and it was delicious."
4,Ive been going to nichole for about 6 months! Not only does she do an awesome perfect job! BUT the compliments are non stop : )
4,"If I could give 10 stars, I would. I have a wonderful experience EVERY TIME I come here. Everyone that works here does amazing (& very thorough) work. Clean, organized, calming environment & they use new utensils on each person! Doesn't get better than this. I highly recommend this salon! \n\n-\""I feel pretty... Oh so pretty....\"""
4,Food is delicious!!! I had the crispy shrimp Napoli for appetizer and the sauce was very good!! For entree I had the crab and shrimp cakes. So rich and tasty!! Also the vegetables are very good. Our server was friendly and helpful! Will definitely be going back!
4,"This is my 3rd visit here. It is our favorite Sunday breakfast spot! It's a tiny corner cafe in a strip mall. Pretty nondescript (these are usually the best places)... Seats about 40 people inside and 12 on the patio. Skipping to the good stuff, the food!!!! I've not had anything here I didn't like! The pancakes are the size of hub caps, coffee is bottomless, service is very friendly and accommodating! If you like eggs Benedict, I highly recommend the French! It has prosciutto ham over a fresh croissant, topped with hollandaise sauce. Ask for the spicy hollandaise to give it an extra bit of a kick;) If you like scrambles/skillets get the kielbasa scramble.  Get there early, there is usually a wait by 11am!"
1,"I dont like bravo. there are better italian chains. this time i orderd the gnocchi and scallops. the gnocchi was not sauced enough and then it was totally overcooked. my co-workers chicken was undercooked. i guess what annoyed me the most about this place was that we made a reservation for 10 ppl and made us arrive at 5pm promptly or they could not guarantee a table. only to find that it was completely empty when we arrived, granted still early for dinner....but even when we left two hours later....the restaurant wasnt even half full. it could have been a staffing issue. overall, olive garden does it better, and carrabas does it way better."
1,"I've been to a few different PT's. This is a nice location, but I'm not impressed by the service. The waitress was very slow. We came in the morning, there were maybe 2 other guests she had to wait on. Once she took our order she then asked if we wanted an extra side of bacon or sausage.... No, no I do not want an extra side of meat lady. If I did I would have told you!!"
0,"This company came highly recommended, and lived up to their reputation. They were prompt in arriving and their technicians were experienced, courteous and thorough. Their prices for repair and service are very reasonable. \nThank you"
1,"I'm not sure if it was just today. They were really busy when we came in on a Sunday night. The last time I came here the portions were HUGE! Now it was a lot smaller. We ordered an asparagus and spinach dip, clam chowder, California Burger, and a bunch of other stuff those are just ones I really remembered. \n\nThe server looked nervous and rushed when he greeted us. We asked for a refill three times on our drinks and never got it. \n\nOur appetizers, asparagus and spinach dip, came after 10 minutes after our main dishes. It tasted bland. And my brother who eats anything even said it wasn't good. There was no taste. My moms clam chowder was way too salty. My burger was not a burger but rather a sandwich. The vegetables along with the avocados was slipping out."
2,"Sorry, I really just don't get it. I didn't hate it and I'm not hating on it now, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.\n\n* Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available.\n\n* Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations!\n\n* Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense.\n\nGood? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really can't say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, there's just no way.\n\nLGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinato's is better.\n\nMost hyped? Most definitely."
4,"Love this place - the food, the ambiance, the SERVICE and the food again! Just perfect. Ask for Devynn if you go! She's fantastic. \n\nThis is an upscale place where you can either dress a little nicer for a great date night or a little more casual."
3,"Last week was my first visit to Floyd's Kitchen.  Overall, the broad menu, great service and terrific happy hour offers made me a fan.  \n\nThey did a nice job with decor, especially with the patio seating (although cushions on the seats would have been even better.)  The weather was perfect, so it was a great day to sit outside.  \n\nWe arrived just before the end of happy hour, which was great, since the deals were nice.  $5 for a very nice zinfandel.  We ordered some very flavorful hummus (even better than Pita Jungle's) - 3 varieties - which had ample hot, flavorful pita triangles.  My husband ordered the shrimp ceviche, which I thought was bland, but he liked that it was fresh and light.  It was also a very large serving.   \n\nMegan, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  She didn't miss a beat and made great recommendations.  She helped us choose a french dip-type sandwich for the husband and chicken piccata for me.  Very large servings at fair prices.  Oh, and they have tater tots!  Who doesn't LOVE tater tots??  \n\nThere really isn't anything negative I can say about our experience.  The service was nice, the ambience relaxed and we took a lot of food home. We definitely plan on going back with the rest of the family."
3,good reasonably priced sushi place on the strip.  outdoor seating.
4,"I love this place. They treat us no different with or without our kids. The teppenyaki chefs are very skilled at what they do and are very fun every time we come by. Everyone is so sweet here. The allow you to get half sushi orders for all you can eat sushi, so you can enjoy a variety of their menu items. They also offer Kama, which  sear salmon head and oysters. And I love that are open late!"
3,"Four Peaks has been a pretty standard lunch/dinner spot for me and my friends for a while now. Burgers are pretty good, fries are awesome, but what really shines about this place is the beer. You can't go wrong with Kiltlifter, it's hands down the tastiest beer they offer. The Hop Knot IPA is pretty good if you enjoy your beer extremely hoppy (like, punch-you-in-the-face levels of hoppy-ness). I actually prefer the Raj IPA, which has a higher alcohol content but has a mellower flavor that is much easier to enjoy. You won't be disappointed if you come here for a meal and a beer."
4,"FOOD is awesome!  If you love organic healthy eats, this is the place for you. It is a bit pricey but unfortunately, organic food costs more.   It is a bit of a hike if you are just visiting but well worth the visit.  LOVE this place!"
1,"I quit this club a few months ago. It looks nice inside, kind of like a nightclub but the place is not very clean. I was shocked when I got home one day after working out and two cockroaches climbed out of my gym bag. It was about one week later that I found a big cockroach in the shower. I smashed it into the floor and then went to the front desk and complained to one of the managers. The next day I went in to take a shower and I saw the guts were still smashed on the floor in there in the corner so they did not do anything about it.\n\nAfter having complained two times to management about the infestation, they should've done something about it. I had to quit my membership after this because there's no way I want to bring this insect back to my new home."
2,"another one opens up....another crowded spot. this is my 3rd Hash House and definitely my least favorite one. we were enough not to have to sit through a long wait to get seated on new years morning when we arrived. the place was crowded but i guess we just got lucky. although, by the time we left the restaurant, the waiting area was completely packed.\n\nanyway, we sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant. our server was nice and friendly, she checked on us frequently even though it was obvious that she was running around servicing multiple large groups. i ordered the andy's sage fried chicken salad while others in my party had the popular dishes, chicken and waffles, pancakes, fried chicken eggs benedict.  my salad, just like all of their dishes, was ginormous! a house bowl of salad with caramlized pecans, apple slices, two pieces of the fried chicken and the big ol' biscuit. i asked for the mango dressing on the side. i have had the sage fried chicken at other locations and this time, my chicken was completely BLAND. what happened???? i was soooo disappointed :( \n\ni still think they have really good food here with over the top portions at good prices but honestly this experience has killed it for me. i was afraid this was going to happen, they grow too fast, open too many locations and suddenly the quality of food goes down. i really hope they make the proper adjustments soon."
1,"I can not stand this place during their reverse happy hour, 8-close. They are completely incapable of handling the large amount of customers that come in for this time. I have tried three times now, to visit Yen during this time, and have walked out after waiting 10-20 minutes to be spoken to, or seated. Try Fresh Wasabi 2 miles down the street, much better service, better happy hour, and better selection of fish (including yellow tail)."
4,"Have dined in most of the Thai restaurants in Vegas and Panna stands out above the rest. Service is phenomenal, and the decor is extremely modern and well done. Now, I know some people enjoy the coconut type Thai food with the sweet tea, etc. etc, but I prefer the Tough Love from my Thai. Panna makes truly hot, spicy food that can easily bring a grown man to tears. I'm sweating a bit right now just thinking about it. So, if you like authentic hot spicy Thai food, Panna is definitely the way to go."
2,"*3 and 1/2 stars*\n\nB&B Burger and Beer could be a 4-star restaurant, but the cleanliness factor drops the rating down a bit.  There were lots of food crumbs under our table, specks of who knows what on my silverware, my seat was wet after being wiped down that I had to ask for a napkin to wipe it dry, and there was a used toothpick on one of the bar high tops where we were sitting at while waiting for our table.   \n\nWhile cleanliness was a let-down, the food, however, was pretty good.  I had the Your Way Bar Burger and basically built a bacon cheeseburger which I really liked, and for my side, I had some onion rings which I enjoyed as well.  The ranch dressing I requested on the side, though, not so good.  The onion rings were better by themselves.  For my drink, I had the Caramel Swirl Shake, which came with a tin container with an extra serving.  That was pretty good too.  \n\nI requested to sit outside on the patio when I made my reservation.  It was too cold to seat people out there though, they said, so we were instead seated at a table for two inside.  Bummer - the view looks nice out from their patio!  \n\nService was fine, but maybe too fast if that's even possible?!  Our check was placed on the table and my dining companion didn't even realize it :p  They were busy but there were definitely some empty tables, so if there was a rush to get us out I don't get it.  \n\nFood was good and service was okay, but just need to improve on cleanliness.  Overall, an okay place!"
3,"I grew up on Chicago's Northwest side, I know a real Gyro. Niro's has Gyros like nobody's business. I've also had their Italian beef, also excellent. I just ate at the new Tempe location, and I am soooo glad I did. The Ahwautukee location is great but a bit further to go for me now.  Facilities are neat and clean at both locations as far as I've seen, and there is a 'midwest' kinda feel that the transplanted vagabond in me yearns for."
2,"We don't typically go out to places like these, salad buffets, mostly because they gross the husband out.  That's fine with me, I understand.  At the request of friends one time, and for a family celebration another, we came here.  I've been to a couple ST locations, and this one seems to be laid out better than others as well as cleaner.  Their selection of food always looks fresh and they don't let it get too low, so that's nice.  I do love their corn bread with the honey whip ( you have to ask for it) and their side dish type pasta salads are usually pretty good.  This place isn't amazing, like my best friend thinks it is, but it is a pretty solid salad buffet."
3,"Had the rare opportunity to abandon the kids for the evening and go and have a night out with the other half.  I tried to book, but was told that they only have so many tables to book each evening and these were gone, so only option was to go in and wait for a table.  We arrived at 730pm Friday 28th sept 2012, told it was a 1hour 45min wait.  We decided to wait, the atmosphere was brilliant, the interior beautiful, I loved the loos, brilliant loo handle, so much so, I had to take a photo ( I must be rather sad, over come with excitement for getting out for the evening).  I think I made my way through half the cocktail list at the bar in the wait for our table, we also ordered 2 appetisers, during our wait at the bar.  The cheesy nachos dish was beautiful and then we ordered bread and oils, this wasn't so good, the bread was dry and required more oil, would have been nice to have a separate dish of oil for dipping.  The bread comes in a fancy small dish, 3 of our breads fell out on the floor, the waitress picked them up and walked away, and to be honest we were that starving from our wait I would have ate them off the floor.  I do think that we should have been given more bread, as the dish the bread is delivered in is not suitable for when waiting in the bar area.  But that is me being very picky.  We did get our table bang on the full 1hr45min wait.  Food arrived promptly that we ordered, I had the pasta arribbatta dish, was very hot and spicy, just the way I love it, my partner had the lamb, he said it was good but he has had better lamb kebabs ( I think that meant it was ok, but not amazing).  I think I will need to go back very soon, this time not so drunk just to check out that it was that great.  Overall I had a brilliant time, met my expectations, I loved the food and the building."
1,"Simply enough, my food was cold. Not just lukewarm but ice cold. I sent it back and when it reappeared, clearly microwaved, the plate was hot but the food was not. I take issue with two things: (a) if I am paying those prices I expect my food to be hot and (b) I do not accept microwaving as an acceptable method of remedying the situation--if I wanted my food microwaved I would go to McDonalds. \n\nWhat was most upsetting, however, is that after sending the food back a SECOND time I was ready to just get the check and go. My dining companion was already finished with his breakfast so I saw no point in waiting around while they \""whipped something up.\"" After some cajoling from our server to order something else, and ordering something else they had the nerve to charge me for the yogurt I reluctantly ordered! In my book, if you mess up someone's meal *twice* you don't charge the person for the replacement. They clearly did not care to have me as a repeat diner and they won't."
3,"Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order."
1,"The food is good, but not any better than the Med Grill nearby.  The desserts are great, but not any better than Gullifty's, around the corner on Murray.  The vegetarian options are great to see.\n\nBut instead of three or four stars, it's a strong two.  I've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant I've been to in the entire city. \n\nMy guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full.  If someone convinces me they fixed the problem with the speed, I'd gladly head back, but until then, they've burned through my goodwill."
3,"Yum! Mayuri Palace was a godsend when we discovered it after a long and frustrating day shopping for cars. Exhausted, cranky, and feeling starved my family stumbled through the doors. The restaurant felt clean and had a decent ambience. With a nice large menu we were almost overwhelmed, but went to some family favorites. The veggie samosas were delicious, but we were sad there were only 2. We really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Tikka, and Lamb Vindaloo. All rich in flavor and cooked well! The garlic naan was perfect. We ordered gulab jamun for dessert and found them a little disappointing. 1/2 warm 1/2 cold like they had been quickly microwaved, and with a simple syrup, and no flavor like rose or cardamom. While we were dining we saw another table redeem a groupon, so we rushed on to see if they were available for purchase. They were (what luck!) and we snapped up a $15 for $30 deal and used it on our meal we were in the process of eating! Overall a great experience, and would certainly go back if we were in the area again!"
0,"Came here for lunch. Lady taking orders ignored us completely, talking to her friend about her kids. Had to actually interrupt them and ask to put in my order. Calamari was soggy and chewy.... disgusting. It took 40 minutes to get my pizza, had to go ask about its status and it was just sitting there ready to go but no one had delivered it to our table. Good pizza, nasty calamari, horrific service. Don't go during lunch time."
0,"Come stay at the MGM Scam. Seriously worst hotel experience ever. For the money, it's just plain robbery, and we've had better service at a Motel 6.\n\nLong story short, we made a reservation, but that didn't matter. We were put in the South Tower, and told it was an \""upgrade\"" by the attendant from the West Wing. Afterwards we found out where we reserved our room was better by far, so we were flat out lied to. Then in our crap overpriced room, there was no fridge, no storage, and no lights in the shower. We were surrounded by college drunks sharing rooms, with garbage and empty pizza boxes in the hallway.\n\nOn top of this, be prepared to pay a $28 per day fee, which was explained as mandatory for all guests. This is for spotty wifi service. Yes that's $28 a day for wifi. We also paid $43 for a quesadilla from room service... A single quesadilla.\n\nThis was also our anniversary. We explained this hoping to get a little better treatment, or at least a discount, but no, just a $75 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the wifi.\n\nIf you want to come to Vegas, don't stay here, and don't come longer than a day. It's fun for about 5 minutes, until you get puked on, both figuratively and literally, by apparently the finest Vegas has to offer."
2,"Classic comedy club set up and venue. We got hooked-up with good front seats, which was pretty cool. The guest comedians were decent, not bad, but not great. Drinks were mediocre. Overall, we had a ok time. For the price, I would not call this a \""must stop\"", unless you have nothing else going on..."
2,this place is a franchise and gets nothing special. but very good they have items like personal pizzas and great sourdough! theyre bread is what makes them.
1,"Two things keep me coming back to this place: 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesday at lunch and the staff,  \n\nHennessey's is one of the few real bars in downtown Vegas -- which is casino-centered.  It sells itself as an Irish Pub, but comes off with more of a Bennigan's vibe.  The prices are pretty steep for the mediocre quality of the food, but cut those prices in half for 2 for 1 burgers and its worth a visit.  Beyond that, the only real reason to visit is to catch sports on a big screen tv outside of a Fremont Street casino.\n\nThe customer service is pretty solid and the servers do a good job keeping the customers happy."
0,"The place seemed to have a good vibe, but there was a problem in the bar! I needed two water for a friend and myself, but out of courtesy, I did not want to order water alone (I believe in contributing to an establishment). I ordered a vodka/redbull and two waters. I asked him to close out immediately. $14 was charged to my card... for a shot of house vodka/ redbull. \""$14 seems too much for a vodka/redbull.\"" I said. His rebuttal: \""You're in Vegas, what did you expect? I can't give your money back.\"" I asked, \""Please return the money to to the card.\"" He then said, \""You're too broke for Vegas, aren't you?, and preceded to close out the transaction on the computer ... Angry, I asked for the manager. The manager tossed the beverage and returned my money in cash. \n\nIn my experience as a restaurant manager, I have seen bartenders/servers take advantage of people who are \""out of sorts\"" through several methods. Watch out for people like this on the strip. \n\nThe bartender's name was Adam. \n\nCheers."
2,"Ok first the good.\nReclining seats.\nAlcohol\n\nBad \nAssigned seating\nWe got our assigned seating and sure enough when we entered the theater there were people in our seats. They said will move if you want but there's a lot of seats open so we just chose seats and sat there.\n\nOf course right before the movie started here comes people and we were in their seats!!!!\n\nWell ..   They threw a fit.  Embarrassing!!!\nSo I told them somebody was in our seats. \nThey said \""it doesn't matter\""\nLOUDLY\n\n\nSo needless to say we had to move.\nUghhhhh\nToo much of a hassle!!!!\nRed rock ..  Here we come!"
3,This place was sooo hard to find because they had no sign.  If my friend didn't tell me it was right next to Raku I wouldn't have found it.  It was worth it though.  Much like In-n-Out there is a very small menu but the quality and simplicity made up for it.  I am a fan!
2,"This is a very convenient location, located right along the Fremont Experience. It was great to be able to get a warm donut with that yummy glaze really early in the morning. For such a small location, they have a pretty good selection of donuts.   The worker was not too friendly or helpful when I asked about the donuts. ^_^*~"
3,"Had to give them some love, just eat here the other day, been there tons of times best dogs ever flame broiled you can burn em if you want... Chili and cheese are both great stuff. Only thing they always have a big line but that's tells you the place is a Tempe staple!"
2,"We love trader joes.  Great deals. Things we like. We routinely fill up our basket and fill up our fridge and pantry.  \n\nBut.... The staff and management seem to care more about each other than the customer. Over and over I am surprised at how much the joke and talk to each other and never talk to the customer. I almost feel like I am bothering them!  Today I was finally prompted to write a review because as my son was picking out a little prize, I was moved out if the way by an employee.  Sorry for being in your way!  Seriously the manager needs to have a meeting and remind EVERYONE who really pays their wages. I will be back. But it isn't because I feel like the staff cares. Only because I like the products."
1,"Usually I love this restaurant, however after eating crab cakes I was very sick and it ruined my evening. Not going back"
4,Love the workers and the owner is always available and friendly.  We are return customers.
1,"This is not really Mexican Food, but a menu that puts together items with a south of the border flair.  While the chips and salsa are good and served in a unique way, this may be the highlight of the night.  The food is expensive, and really not that great.  The margaritas are way too sweet, and the number of tequilas you can order is very limited for a place that serves Mexican Food.  The service is good and the decor is nice, and the outside patio area is great, but none of this matters when the food is lousy.  Been there several times, won't be going back."
1,"This place LOOKS really awesome...andddd okay, I'm done with the PROs. In all fairness, I am NOT a sushi/fish person. I was with a party of 8 and I simply got outvoted (even though it was my birthday weekend, funny how that worked now that I think about it...)\n\nAnyways, here were my MAJOR issues (not enough time or space to list them all):\n\n-I found our waitress to be very aloof, verging on unfriendly. \n-RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!...and I've been to Atlantis, so overpriced food does not scare me, but I expect it to at least be decent.\n-I had to limit my dining choices to non-fish entrees, which was not easy, but I did manage to find some things....\n--Tempura asparagus...they brought it out to me and there were TWO PIECES ON MY PLATE!!!!! OMFG, TWO, 2, DOS? Seriously?! I was done right there, but no, I had to keep going. My friend that was with me owns a fine dining catering company and worked at The Ritz, so I know when even HE says something is a rip off, it's BAD. In fact, our table was going on and on about it SO much that I think they must have overheard us, because they didn't charge me for it.\n--Next, I ordered 2 Wagyu tacos. Now, she told me they were small. Okay, cool, I'm thinking like street taco size-ish. I am NOT being hyperbolic when I say they were the SIZE OF MY PINKY FINGER!!!!!!! I held it up against my finger to take a photo of it!!! And the best part...THIRTEEN DOLLARS EACH!!!!!!!! And you had to order a minimum of 2.\n--By this time, you would like I'd just stop eating and cut my losses, but no. I ordered a chicken kabob and a steak kabob. The chicken was overcooked and dry and the steak was so UNDER cooked that I think I heard it moo...blood was oozing. Gross. \n--Their beers were TINY and $10 each. Ouch. \n\n\nOkay, now wanting to be fair, here are my husband's thoughts...a sushi pro:\n\n-Overpriced, but expected.\n-4 of the other people in our group gave a \""price point\"" of $75 a person and said, serve whatever you want to us...he liked that.\n-Their \""signature\"" dish of black cod with miso was very delicious & succulent, everything else was \""fine\""\n-Annoying that it was being split between 4 people and they continuously gave portions of 5 or 6. Either give 4 or 8! How hard is that?!...it was like they wanted to start a brawl. \n-Wouldn't need to return, but don't regret going.\n\n\nThat about sums it up."
3,"Very good, and their prices are great!"
4,"What a fun place!\n\nAces & Ales has a beer snob's selection of drafts and bottles worthy of your attention!  Additionally they have a lot of great Bourbon, Rye, and Scotch.  This is not a snobby place though.  It is down-to-earth and equipped for a good time with your friends.  I'm pretty sure that a gastro pub got it on with a mid-west locals bar and sprung off Aces & Ales!\n\nI didn't try a lot of food while I was there, but not because I didn't want to.  I had the Buffalo Mac-N-Cheese and loved it!  The food looked like a lot of great foodie, comfort food...stuff I would love to come back and taste, while motivating me to go to the gym the next day!\n\nCome here for Great beer!\nCome here to play pool and bar games with your friends!\nCome here for tasty comfort food!"
4,"Me and the husband love this place. The employees seem like their all related, which makes it feel homey. The portions are big and a good deal. The fried ahi poke salad is HUGE! I think 3 or even 4 people could munch on that. My husband always seems to get the loco moco and he never seems to finish it, trust me he can pack it away. I had the roast pork and I could not finish that plate as much as I tried to. We've also had their fried rice with egg and portuguese sausage. I really like this place and they seem to get alot of people in. The only cons of the place is #1 their closed in Sunday and Monday, #2 the place should be bigger because it seems sorta small and sometimes their people waiting outside or their cars just to eat there."
2,"Ahhhh... Do you hear them?  The angels?  They're singing the praises of Chicken Bryan.  Now, I don't know who Bryan is, but he  knows exactly how to make some seriously good chicken!\n\nI was actually really upset with Carrabba's as a chain for a while.  They used to have these wonderful, lovely croutons, but suddenly changed the recipe.  I even wrote to them about it, and they were like.. \""well, our test groups liked these new ones better, sorry\"".  It took me a bit to get over it.  Those were some seriously good croutons!  I recovered, however, and continued to enjoy one of my favorite dishes ever created.  (Yes, the chicken bryan)\n\nThere are actually many wonderful dishes on their menu.  Their pasta dishes are unique, not your typical Italian chain fare.  There's also a wonderful special that shows up every now and then.. Trout Wulfe.  Delicate trout fillet lightly fried then topped with a lemony basil and tomato butter sauce.  Very delicious!\n\nThis location has a nice staff.  I've been a regular here for several years and see lots of familiar faces.  They make a really good pomegranate martini and if you manage to have room, the dessert rosa is delightful.\n\nAs chains go, Carrabba's does it right.  Definitely worth a stop."
0,service sucks; they're super rude when you're inebriated (not that i was) and the food is mediocre. think big portions of deep fried blah food.\n\nterrible. don't do it!! \n\n(one star because i went 2x and the 2nd time was MARGINALLY better & i can't give a lower rating than one)
1,"Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \n\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \n\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \n\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\n\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\n\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \n\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \n\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price."
4,This place is so awesome! This is my wife an I second time back and it is just as awesome as the first time! We highly suggest coming here for great sushi if you're on this side of town. Great value and service is great!
3,"One of the iconic places on State, my roommate and I visit this place a lot when we stayed downtown. Even after moving to west Madison, we still go back pretty often when we are on State. You just can't say no to ice-cream, rich and creamy ice-cream. They have disclaimers that give you plenty of heads-up as to what is in store for you. Lots of milk, cream, dairy products, chocolates or whatever the flavor of the ice-cream is. \n\nMy favorites are the zanzibar (three different types of chocolates, can it get better??), oreo espresso, and black raspberry. As it varies from person to person, the best way is still to try their generous samples and just see which one bought you over. \n\nTheir menu also extends to sundaes, milkshakes, take-home pints etc, just in case you want to deviate a little from the usual cones or dishes."
3,"Went to the Nugget over the passed weekend for a friends wedding and stayed to party...  \n\nI never stayed here before, but was really surprised on how clean my room was for $39 a night.  When I was helping my friend check in they were cleaning her carpets, when I went to check in they just finished changing my filter on my a/c...  Not to shabby of a room... I mean I had a huge flat screen TV, granite and tile bathroom..  I felt I should be paying more...   Plus all guest get access to an awesome pool area.  They have a live shark/fish aquarium that has a water slide that goes right through it..  They offer lounge chairs, a hot tub, pool side bar, seriously what else can you ask for.  Yes the casino part is all old and ranky, but that's ol' Vegas baby.  \nI did get to see the wedding chapel and for what my friend paid for her services it was a steal.  Very elegant and formal feel.  Also an after party was in a suite and can I tell you, I felt like I was walking in the Tony Montana's house in Scarface, really HOT!  The suite had a jacuzzi tube, double story loft vibe, dramatic curvy staircase,a steam shower, baday(I totally know I spelled that wrong, but whatever) , full party bar stocked with glasses, nice loud stereo totally staying there next time I go..  For reals though... don't pay the high prices on the strip, get a bargin and stay here.. I was really impressed."
3,"Seriously Good Thai Noms...\n\nStopped in for take out one afternoon, to try it out...Ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp and Tom Kha Gai, as I have found them to be good tests of a Thai kitchen's capabilities.\nThe soup was wonderful, not firey, but plenty of flavor, with lots of straw mushrooms, chicken and herbs.  The inclusion of fresh tomato was a nice plus.\n\nThe Pad Thai was fantastic...lots of big plump shrimp, good sauce, nice veggies, beautifully arranged even in a take out container....in fact, had they but included a wedge of lime to squeeze over it, it would have been utter perfection.\n\nA definite plus is that both dishes were cooked and ready to go in just 5 minutes!\n\nThe dining room is still as lovely as it was in the previous incarnation, but the lower prices and larger servings are a major plus.  The outside seating area is very nice.\n\nI will DEFINITELY be visiting here again, often!\n\n(I just wish they delivered)"
4,Thicks is a very nice bicycle shop I bought my first fat bike there and it is wonderful the  people are awesome and they are all very patient with you. I bought a mukluk salsa there and haven't regretted it yet. Met some cool people there. No matter what kind of ridder u are they will help u. Lot and lots of products kept in stock. And to the sales lady that help me you're wonderful and thank you again.
0,"Bad service, period.  We were the only customers and they could not have been more dismissive of us. For instance,  I had to get up to ask for a refill of my ice tea.  My wife and I just sat there confused about the poor service. It was almost surreal. The crepes were OK, but way overpriced."
1,"The beer selection was great, the food was decent, the service was terrible. I'm normally not one to complain about service at a restaurant, but our server seemed awfully put out that she had to even deal with us.  Any place that has summer shandy on tap usually gets automatic points from me, but I probably won't be back here."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!\nHorrible customer service!! Racist employees and managers!! IF they do serve you, the odds of your order being wrong are higher then the contrary!\nI work too hard for my money, to be treated like it's less green then... The bills of my peers."
0,"I can't believe this still happens in this day and age,but I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  My close friend, who happens to be trans but dresses and presents main stream - no weird hair colors, tattoos, provocative dress, etc., was informed by a staff member after he asked for help that \""his kind isn't wanted here.\"" He's going to go and talk to management today and I'll be contacting corporate on this one, but until the employee is gone I will not be shopping here again!"
1,"$26.75 will get you :\nRefrigerator flavored bread and butter\nStale chips and runny old salsa\nBrown over cooked meat (or is it?)\nSushi (wait, what is that again? Rice and cucumbers, oh yeah, sushi)\nShrimp cocktail from costco\nFrozen Crab legs\nBurnt potato wedges\nA sign that says bread pudding, but I wouldn't dare try it to find out if the sign were true. A reminder of why I haven't done a buffet in 20 years and why I will never again. Blech. \nNice server though."
3,"The portions here are huge! Usually, mongolian bbq places give you a tiny bowl and I find all kinds of ways to maximize the space but here I pretty much don't need to. (although I still do and I end up with 2 big takeout boxes. haha) besides that, they give you rice and soup. so it's a good deal.\n\nI'll tell you my secret: first you unroll the frozen pieces of meat and you flatten them with your napkin. Cover the bottom of the bowl. then you line broccoli with the heads pointed out of the bowl all around the rim. This makes your bowl bigger. then you pile up everything else you want on top. haha. :D"
3,Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try while I was in Vegas.  The way to order is really confusing.  There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.  \n\nThe best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.  \n\nTacos El Gordo is right off of the strip so its really easy to find.  Parking can be a little difficult at times because it just gets so crowded on the strip.
0,"This review isn't about the food. \n\nBasically after our meal, we paid partially cash and the rest was on my card. Let's just say someone charged the full amount of my card around $90 even though I know i signed a credit card receipt for $30 something dollars. \nClearly the waiter felt that he was smart enough to steal from me! Ugh! \n\nLuckily i did get my money back, but honestly for all the trouble I went through, they should have picked up the whole bill. Management did help me through this, but no one really bothered to make up for this horrible experience."
0,"Sorry to disagree with all the gangplank boys, but.... well.... I strongly disagree. Chuck and I stopped at Coffee Island on our way to Gangplank this afternoon and I really wish I would have just spent 3 minutes making sandwiches at home and saved us the $13. \n\nI had the Ham & Swiss, Chuck had the Southwest Sandwich, and I could have EASILY made the same sandwiches at home for a fraction of the cost. . The sandwiches were good, but not amazing. Our beverages were 2 cans of pop- Diet Coke and Dr Pepper. Whoa!... Turns out those are both found in my refrigerator as well! And, had to pick a chunk of mold off of my bread\n\nNext time, I'll definitely choose cooking myself over throwing money down the drain at Coffee Island. \n\nAlthough, on the upside, the 2 people working there were extremely nice, bringing out extra dill pickles, and stirring up some conversation (in the 10 minutes it took to make a frickin' sandwich)."
1,"I went here based on the Yelp reviews and from recommendations from my husband's co-workers. I won't be returning. I was already skeptical about coming here because of the multiple Yelp reviews mentioning the security guard in the parking lot and the shady part of town that it's located in.  My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.\n\noh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are."
3,"I'm becoming a huge fan of Alofts. They are cheaper than Westins or Ws, and generally much nicer than Sheratons, which tend to be overpriced and outdated. I just wish they all offered free breakfast, which this location does not. This would be a good choice for a one night stay near the airport."
4,Wonderful service - my fiance and I both had a full treatment and it was excellent. Thanks Lmarie!
3,Great food! Excellent place to eat out near campus. Could do better with reservations. They have missed mine twice.
0,They get one star for having a beautiful casino. Outside of that I would never come here to gamble again. The rooms are great but the service on the casino floor has to be the worst on the strip. The machines don't pay and they crash a lot. I have come here three times over a 5 year span and every time there has been an issue and they did a poor job of taking care of the guest. This third chance is the last they will get from me
2,"I must admit that I prefer Caribou's coffee over Starbucks when I am drinking black coffee, which is most of the time.  I find their coffee to be full-flavored without tasting burnt.   This particular Caribou is a little small, but it is cozy.  For nice days, you can grab your fav cup of joe and sit out on the patio."
3,"One of those places that can not possibly serve bad food...! Lunch, specifically, is very nice, quick and affordable... All their curries as well as entrees are equally good and you can ogfcourse adjust the level of spice as in all Thai places... ( that's something I don't like but serves good for those who don't eat spicy food)... Thai coffee is one of my favourites too..."
1,"The food here is subpar, at best. When we asked for a kids cheese pizza, they basically smeared some tomato sauce on a tortilla, sprinkled a few strings of shredded cheese on it and, with the way the cheese barely looked melted, I'd estimate they'd popped it in the microwave for maybe 30 seconds. It's a shame the food is so bad though because the decor is fantastic and, getting to take a tour of the kitchen before you eat is something you definitely don't experience everywhere. At least you know that, even if the final dish doesn't taste that great, it came from a clean kitchen."
2,"I really, really, really wanted to like this place. Really. In fact before I even knew much about it as a restaurant, every time I passed it in Mandalay Bay I thought it was so cool how they had this towering wine cellar. I loved the exterior decor and what little I could peek into the interior. Five years in the making and finally I got to eat here.\n\nSigh. Maybe I hyped it too much myself? It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong? \n\nWell, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes? \n\nThey also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?\n\nThe only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines. What's the point if you're just going to stock it with 100 bottles of the same wine with no room for others?\n\nOverall, it wasn't worth the money and I don't see how it was worth the Michelin star."
3,"So I had the grandparents (From England) and my mom in Town for the weekend. It was the last night before they left so I was looking for a good go to spot with moderate prices. When in doubt, I Yelped it out! \n\nI came across St. Francis on Top 50 hottest restaurants in Phoenix. I looked over the reviews and was won over. The menu looked great, it was different from the standard OId Town Scottsdale scene we had done for the past three nights so I was sold. \n\nAs we arrived I was impressed right off the bat by the building. It has a unique modern look with a very open feel.  It is a two storied restaurant that probably fits around 75 people on each floor. \n\nWhen we arrived I went with a fellow Yelper recommendation with the Meyers Lemonade. It was somewhat refreshing but the Honey was a little over powering for my taste. \n\nFor apps we order the Corn Chowder and the Goat Cheese to share. I always back and forth on Goat Cheese it's kind of like when you go on a date and it only goes ok you could live without seeing them again or you could see them again (kind of a stretch analogy I apologize) Regardless this Goat Cheese was out of this world. It was perfect melted temperature accented with basil and various with ingredients. The Corn Chowder was also very good. It was very light and not very filling which made it great as an app. \n\nThe table pretty much covered all the entrees ordering the Pot Roast, Cioppino, Roasted Chicken, Salmon Salad and finally I ordered the Hangar Steak. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. The Cioppino had a little Bobby Flay type spice to it so just a heads up. My Hangar Steak was awesome cooked perfectly and a good size. \n\nFinally to top off the fat kid meal dessert. Now I am like many fellow yelpers and never order dessert....that's a lie I look at the dessert menu more than the entree menu. Now with my Grandparents are from England so they thought they would give their expert opinion on the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Much to my surprise they have it the thumbs up. It we a perfect temp, size, taste and the accent of the vanilla ice cream was perfect. \n\nNow after writing a novel why did this only get four stars from me? Unfortunately the service wasn't the best. Our server acted like this was his first serving job. He just forgot a number of the basics we constantly needed to ask for i.e. spoons for soup, water and steak knives with dinner. \n\nIn the end I will come back to St. Francis without question!"
2,Didn't know what to eat at home so I decided to try this place out this morning. The prices are decent and the amount of food is a pretty good portion. I got the Steal and Eggs which came with toast and fruit. I loved the staff and Norm was actually there in person. It's a very friendly place to eat in and I would definitely consider going back.
3,"3 for $3 Deal rocks as do the new drinks, I loved the 50/50, half lemonade, half iced tea.  The husband enjoyed his cherry lemonade too.  Watch out though they do charge an extra $.50 cents per hot dog to add cheese.  This was a great little snack after a long tough day of outlet shopping.  Oh and their fries are right up there with McDonalds, Yum!"
1,I'm a big fan of Saddle Ranch but not this location. I got charged $25 for 2 drinks and I had to sit next to a dirty dish rag and a beer tower that had been tapped for at least an hour. Drinks were actually less expensive inside the stadium by $10. I think I'll stick to the one in Scottsdale and actually save money.
4,"1 word: Yummy!! And $20 per adult is a great price for the amount of food you get. They have a sign when you walk in that says \""Loosen Yer Belt\"".... Do it! Great view of the Superstition Mountains. Definitely a place to take AZ visitors!"
1,"I know Jimmy John's is all about \""super freaky fast\"" service, but their manners are also pretty freaky.  I'm usually sympathetic to unmotivated or cranky employees (after all, there's nothing glamorous about working at a fast food place).  Unfortunately, the college kids who work here are particularly resentful--and they don't mind taking it out on your sandwich.\n\nI came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends.  When I tried to place my order, the girl working the register (who was obviously new) struggled to punch in each item.  No one seemed interested in helping her, even though 4 other people stood behind the counter.  She finally started yelling at them...still, they just stared blankly at the cold cuts in front of them (maybe they were stoned?).  \n\nAfter they made and wrapped my subs, they placed them on the counter in front of me.  I asked if they could bag them since it would be awkward to carry all those sandwiches on my own.  One employee pointed to a stack of paper bags and told me I could bag them myself, if I wanted.\n\nThe sandwiches are all just variations on a theme: meat of choice, watery mayo, tomatoes, a modest smear of avocado, and too much shredded iceberg lettuce.  The taste is much improved if you add their tasty hot peppers, but I very rarely crave a Jimmy John's sandwich.\n\nFor fast food sandwiches, I vote Subway.  The only benefit of Jimmy John's is that they deliver."
0,"Easily one of the worst Walmarts ever! Horrible rude customer service! I have had to go back several different times for mistakes that they have made too. Whether they've messed up an oil change causing leaks, double charged me on groceries because a computer glitch charged my card twice and they did not want to refund the extra 160.00 right away until I raised hell about it because I could not afford it, to cashiers not wanting to honor a .50 coupon on any pampers wipes because the cash register didn't acknowledge it. A manager finally told the cashier to honor the .50 off anyway because the cash register messed up; or having to go back because the cashier told me I had all my groceries when, \""oops\"" I went home and discovered I didn't and had to go back. One cashier even recommended I shop at Fry's if I wanted better discounts. I'm tired of getting burned at Walmart. I now love, love, love shopping at Fry's!"
2,"The atmosphere and decor are very in tune with what they serve...rustic booths, and bar, with fishing nets hanging on the walls. Went with my girlfriends, and we ordered the Rockefeller oysters, and the regular oysters, along with a lobster roll, and fries. The oysters, in my opinion, we're nothing to write home about. The lobster roll on the other hand was pretty good. The lobster meat was fresh, and not \""rubbery\"". However, I think they should TOAST their buns, but other than that it was good. The fries were pretty good too, they're spiced up with something, can't quite put my finger on it, but whatever it is, it gave them an addictive taste, we couldn't stop eating them. On of my friends had a beer, the other had a Rum and coke and she said it was watered down. So I wouldn't go here for drinks.The staff is very nice and helpful when asked questions about the menu. When in the mood for a lobster roll, will consider this place again."
3,"Quelle vari\u00e9t\u00e9!!!!!! Il y en a r\u00e9ellement pour tous les go\u00fbts! Cela peut-\u00eatre pour votre anniversaire, pour un service traiteur, pour un mariage, pour r\u00e9galer vos convives un soir de No\u00ebl ou tout simplement pour vous sucrer le bec un apr\u00e8s-midi... Cela vaut le coup de s'y arr\u00eater au moins une fois.\nLes propri\u00e9taires viennent tout droit de la France pour vous faire d\u00e9couvrir cette petite gourmandise!"
4,"Great service, we tell everyone that mentions needing pest control to try Bug-N-Out!"
4,"We lived in Japan for 3 years and became obsessed with Japanese style curry. Short of hopping on a plane back to our favorite Curry restaurant in Yokohama, this place is the best! \nThe curry is perfectly seasoned, all proteins are cooked very well and portions are a good size."
1,My biggest beef with this place is portion size. Their lunch portions are tiny and their dinner portions are only slightly better. \n\nIt's a good standby if nothing else sounds good. \n\nThe bartenders always seem rushed and out of breath - even when there is nobody in the restaurant. Kinda strange...
2,"We always stay at Sam's Town when we visit Vegas, and so we usually start out our day by eating at TGI Friday's.  We have been going to the hotel for years, and remember when the space used to be the Harvest House, which was an old school coffee shop kind of 24 hour restaurant.  \n\nSo, we like to have breakfast but they don't have a lot of omelette selections, not very creative that is.  They have a special priced lunch menu, so one day this last trip I tried the special $5.99 cobb salad.  First of all, we waited over 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it, and when my salad came, it was a very small piece of chicken, a half of a hard boiled egg, and like a cherry tomato sliced in half.  My husband had ordered breakfast.  How long does it take to make breakfast?  \n\nI said something to the hostess and she offered to give us a dessert for free, but all of their desserts look big and my husband is a diabetic and I'm on a diet (did you see the salad??) so I said \""No thanks.\""  \n\nWe've been there other times when you basically have to get up and walk over to get your bill, get your bill paid, or get a drink refill.  The service is slow, but it never seems overly crowded in there.  Now on two occasions this trip, there was a large party in the other room...and everyone was working on them.  \n\nAlso, I guess is the case with the chain's restaurants, the booths and the seats are not super comfy.  The turkey burger on the special lunch is pretty good, and it comes with homemade potato chips, which are good, if not fattening.  Most of the tables don't feel too crammed up against other tables and the restaurant opens up into the casino, which is fun if you are there to gamble.  You can see the action while you eat."
2,"It's not the most convenient, but every trip I take down here, I like to hop on it at least once and ride to the end and back to see what's new that's not directly on the strip. You get a good view, and can sit with your feet up for a few and check things out."
2,"Yesterday was my first visit.  I had gotten a flyer in the paper and I had passed the place. So knowing what they had I went in. \nThe place was clean and bright. I liked that.\nI ordered my cheesesteak with fries and the reguler drink size. No meal deal here $10 Buck! This make me not so happy, because I love this meal, but I don't go get a $10 sandwich meal each week.. The food was hot, fresh and tasty and came faster than I expected. This made me happy. The Sub roll was fresh, soft, warm and loaded with meat, mushrooms, onioned green bell pepper slices. My only disappointment was with the fries. The fries taste a little strange like they are coated with something during processing. They come out crisp and look fine. I had this experience at other locations. They should change fries. I plan to not order them ever again. Besides at $2 you get a handful small side of them. When I order fries in addition and pay extra I expect enough to share or make a meal of.  I'm just saying one feels they have been budozooled by the cost and portion you get for $2, We are a McDonald's super size nation and well if I was paying $2 for fries at Mc D's a hell of a lot of fries would be on the plate!  But since I don't like these fries and plan to skip them in the future unless they change fry suppliers the small portion was enough.\n\nHowever the cheese steak was awesome but extra cheese  should be advised.\n\nThey offer beer here also but the service is somewhat just there and not actually suggesting or tempting to up sell you, so I saw this after the fact.  Oh well there's room for improvement but they make a great variety of Cheesesteaks and deli sandwiches to enjoy."
1,"A Thanksgiving \""dont\"".  A total turkey.   We were looking forward to a nice meal with our adult children and grandchild.  We were offered a selection of salmon, turkey, and beef, which came with appetizers, sides, and desserts, all inclusive.  Our granddaughter wanted green beans.  She is 3, and frankly, the fancy stuff just does not impress her.  So here came a plate of green beans, which were taken away as soon as dinner arrived.  The staff is VERY quick on the withdraw.  We requested they bring the green beans back, and she got a plate of fresh - and very hot green beans.  We ate our meals, very nicely plated and well seasoned, but frankly, it was not even close to impressive, very tiny portions too.  I'm sure they were churning these meals out quickly in the kitchen, as it was very crowded in the dining room.  Our bill was over $300.00,( there was one glass of wine in that mix), because they mistakenly charged us for the 3 year old.  Even though the waitress asked us how old she was.  Nothing was very hot, nothing was very good, and I think that the price was totally out of line."
0,"Ehh, the tortilla chips were too thick and hard for me, my jaw hurt and I got a headache from eating them :(\n\nTableside guac was so amateur! They had all the ingredients already in the bowl and the dude just mixed it up.  Didn't even ask me if I wanted it chunky or anything. \n\nI ordered the most expensive thing on the menu -- a filet steak with two cheese enchiladas.  Now, the sauce was pretty good; it was chile gastrique.  Not sure what that means, but it was sweet and went well with the steak.  I really liked the cheese enchiladas, too.  The menu is proud to stick a little * next to the filet, saying you can get it cooked to order any way you like, but they go ahead and ignore your request, lol.  I wanted medium rare and they gave me well done.  I got a second one but eh, wasn't in the mood for it anymore.\n\nGo to Bourbon Steak at this hotel if you're here instead :)"
1,Im not a huge fan of MGM. The players club associates have attitudes. The servers are rude. The same server asked me for my ID 3 times. They don't give you a bracelet like the Venetian to let other severs and security know your 21+
0,"Had my front door rekeyed a year ago and the entire mechanism broke. The metal they use is really soft and wears down quickly. I called to see if there was any fee they could waive to come back out, and she said no. I asked if they have any warranty on quality of product and she said only 90 days. That's how long junk will last. Save your money and go somewhere else!!!!!!"
2,"The admission is free but expect it to be small and have only several food trucks there.  It is hard to find a free parking lot, especially you are not from the area and don't know much just like me.  There were some street parking with meters if you go early enough.  If not, you probably will end up paying $5 for parking.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I went there basically just for Fuku Burger.  It was truly delicious, just like I expected.  Other than this food truck, I did not find anything else that attractive.  We got there after 7 and there weren't too many people.  Like others say, there are only a few tables so expect to eat standing or just sit on the side of the road.  \n\nIf you have nothing else to do, I would say go ahead but don't waste time going if you have other stuff you want to do.  I would recommend to check out Fuku Burger and their location changes everyday."
3,Best coleslaw of my life.  The pork sandwich was a little dry but they give you a cup of their homemade BBQ sauce which was really good.
0,"You can read the other reviews to understand how the service works (or doesn't work as the case may be..) Let me just give you my highlights:   Stood in line for 55 min for a bowl of pasta - you only get a beeper if your ordering pizza - the pasta was very good. But not worth standing in line for 55 min.   Went to the bar for a glass of wine - bartender's opening words were NOT \""hi, what can I get you..\"" instead: \""When you tip your bartendar, please put the money on the bar and not in the cannister. Tips in the cannister have to be shared with all the employees..\""  Seriously. Really.  I then got served a warm glass of mediocre wine. Needless to say, no tipping took place.  Then had to wait in-line to pay the bill for this miserable experience.  Not a manager in sight. No one cared.  Me neither - won't go back."
2,"I was impressed with this locations up-keep. Considering the location, most of the stores are run down and diiiiirty - make no mistake, the Jo-Ann's in Gilbert is much cleaner than this location, but from the last time I was there to now, they have rearranged the store a little and I think it has improved the overall look. The fabrics were neat and tidy, and the girls working there were really nice - although, not too helpful.\n\nThis location has your basic needs for crafty inclinations, which is all I ask."
0,"Let me begin....CAN WE SAY RIP OFF!!!!!  What a joke!!  This place serves plates they call Tapas for full entree prices!!!   We were so annoyed when we got the portions as we really thought someone was playing a practical joke on us when they waitress came over with the dishes!   We all looked at each other and said \""ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  The portions were not big enough even to feed one person let alone a party of 4 people!  Grant it...I am from NYC and are used to paying top dollar for my meals but atleast you get a meal...not a snack!    I don't mind paying high prices for good food and normal entree portions....but this place was truly a rip off and not sure how they are getting away with this!!    DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO EAT DINNER TWICE!!  Because we all left hungry and actually went to another restaurant to dine since the meal at Jaleo was a joke!!"
2,"Patati is a charming little place to eat ridiculously cheap junk food and drink ridiculously cheap beer, but it has to be said that its food isn't particularly amazing.  The poutine is respectable, but the burgers and grilled cheeses taste distinctly homemade. \n\nWorth checking out as a cultural destination, though, or if you're just staggering around drunk."
1,"This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant. \nI would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience."
3,"Super indien: du choix (idem pour les v\u00e9g\u00e9tariens), des plats tr\u00e8s copieux, des menus pour deux, une terrasse... la preuve, on y est all\u00e9s 3 fois pendant notre s\u00e9jour.\nbref je recommande fortement!"
0,"I used to have a monthly subscription to their golfing range.  I really like the fact that we could golf off the grass, but was quickly turned off when they started to force us to hit of astro turf.  \nWhat really made my experience stink was a young male staff member who works in the pro shop.  This kid constantly busts my balls over me not bringing in my key for balls and accused me of \""sharing\"" balls with non-paying members.  After a few times of this rude, totally unnecessary, and unprofessional behavior I cancelled my subscription.  Upon leaving the pro shop on my last visit, I reported the problem employee to the shop manager; they both apparently support this poor behavior, as they both turned, looked at me, and casually snickered while the manager jokingly delivered the news to the problem employee.\n  The combination of poor employees, the frugality regarding saving green surface at the range (seems to be all the time we're forced to hit off astro turf), and the fact that employee's don't take responsibility for their crap attitudes makes this place a real crap hole!"
2,"Hyped by a coworker as her favorite place for Hawaiian cuisine, I made a point to stop by and order some of the dishes she'd suggested. My experience didn't live up to what I'd expected, but it wasn't awful either.\n\nService was great, staff are friendly. Restaurant is clean. Didn't experience the bar.\nOpted for the Local's Plate (beef and chicken teriyaki, two musubi, sides of rice and mac salad) plus a lumpia app. I'm not the hugest fan of teriyaki and this was not one I would necessarily come back for, spam on musubi was thinner and less flavorful than what I've had at L&L, I preferred the lumpia I've had at actual Filipino places, and I'm generally not a fan of mac salad in the first place because of my aversion to mayo.\nThe dishes weren't bad, they were just a little lacking in flavor and not the punch of flavor I'd expected. \n\nWould come back to try other dishes suggested: oxtail soup, adobo fried rice omelet, manapua, but I'm not in a hurry to do so."

3,"Is the food great? So-So. But you can't go wrong either. For a great spur of the moment place, and sticking to basics (Margarita pizza), you can't go wrong. \nf you stick at the bar, and have the fortunate pleasure to have Keao you're very luck. Very professional, yet personable at the same time. She has taken care of us a few times. Always a PRO! \nOh, I find this place to be very fair in price too!"
4,My sister came into town this weekend and we were looking for a nice place to get pedicures and manicures. I looked up some places on Yelp and found a lot of good ratings for Buddha Bar Nails so we thought we'd give a try. We brought out young niece with us and were greeted with smiling faces. I had read a lot of good reviews about Kevin and let me just say they were all true! He was so awesome and friendly while doing my nails. One of my nails hadn't dried all the way and I smudged it. He didn't act like it was a problem but instead went over all my nails again to make sure they were all perfect for me. He is truly one of the best! I would recommend Kevin and the Buddha Bar Nail Salon to every one of my friends!
1,"Service was quick. We stopped in when we had less than an hour for a layover and told them that so they brought food quickly. My friend's burger looked good and he said it was tasty. I was less excited about my salad. I got the chicken salad and asked for dressing on the side. It was brought out with the dressing on it and I didn't say anything since we were in a rush. I asked our waitress what the best salad was and she recommended the Texican Chicken Salad. If this is their best salad, then I surely don't want to try the others. The chicken in this salad was pretty bad- it was overcooked, flavorless and tasted like it had been sitting out for quite a while. Portions were decent and prices were typical bar prices ($8-$11 for burger or salad)."
1,"GROSS!!!! Rehab is the only place in Vegas in which you will never, EVER wait in a bathroom line....huh..wonder why..could all the drunk people be peeing in the pool???? Bet they are! \n\nBeautiful pool and great idea but don't imagine going unless you are near black out and get there early unless you want to hide your stuff in a bush with about 200 other peoples items. \n\nPlaying poker in the pool pretty bad ass tho! and bars EVERYWHERE!"
0,"Everyone was telling me how awesome this place was. I ordered food online from here and everyone in my household's order was incorrect. Some were fine..not too bad of differences and some orders were just...complete messes! When someone had tried to contact me, they clearly could not read when I sent them a comment on their site for feedback. I cannot take calls while I am working. They left messages for me to callback during the most inconvenient times. Why give an option to be contacted via email if you do not do that? I've heard so many great things about this place, but I guess I should have dined in instead."
0,"I take that all back. The food was terrible this last time I went. It seems as if they raise the prices and lowered the quality. I remember when you would have to wait in line to get in here on a Saturday morning and this time half the place was empty. Tsk, tsk."
3,"YUMMY FRESH SEAFOOD!!!! That equals a happy experience in my book. The oysters at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille in the Strip are total perfection. Slurp one of those and you are instantly transported mentally to the beach. We ate so many of them at a recent Yelp event that we nearly shamed ourselves. As a result, we couldn't wait to return for dinner and we didn't wait long to make that happen. \n\nMy hubby and I order a calamari starter pretty much everywhere we go. We're obsessed and we make no apologies! No apologies needed for the calamari here! Super fresh, lightly breaded and cooked to tender, mouth watering delight. The basil marinara it was served with was a bit bland, however. Punch up the dipping sauce and its a home run.\n\nBeing the seafood haven that they are, they also serve sushi. I ordered the charred tuna and it was every bit as fresh and delish as I'd hoped.\n\nFor dinner my husband ordered the soft shell crab special and he raved. I also have a crab addiction, just not for soft shells. I took a bite of his and as soft shells go, they were good - just not my thing. He just kept making happy, crunchy food noises next to me.\n\nMore to my liking was the Broiled Atlantic cod topped with colossal lump blue crab served with lobster cream sauce. It came with a side of grilled asparagus and I opted out of the potatoes in favor of their roasted root veggies as my 2nd side. The lump crab in that sauce had me making those happy noises every time I took a bite and there were lots of hearty bites to be had & I even shared with my boy. I'm sure it was intended to be a complete bite with the cod, I just couldn't make myself do that. The cod was really good and very fresh but for me the crab took the starring role.  The portion was big enough for me to take home lunch for the next day - minus the crab that I'd inhaled.\n\nI could have had a whole plate of just that lump crab and probably would have upped to 5 stars. Can this be added to the menu??? Actually anytime a lump crab entree is on any menu, I order it.\n\nWe walked by on a recent Saturday and saw this restaurant was bumping at lunchtime, which I was super happy to see. Luke's is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and I'd love to see this restaurant do really well. I can only imagine what is yet to come here and I'm excited for it!"
3,"Fast and friendly service. The lunch combos are reasonably priced and decent size portions. The first time I went I ordered the Bo Bo chicken and was disappointed. The chicken was kind of tough and I did not care for the seasoning.  I probably would not have gone back if my friend didn't like the place so much. The second time I went I ordered the Happy Family lunch combo and it was very good. Lots of fresh tasting vegetables, good sauce, beef, chicken, and shrimp with egg fried rice and a spring roll. Other than the Bo Bo chicken I've liked everything I've tried there.  A solid choice."
0,"I have always loved PF Chang's but they last two times at this location have been horrible. The first time was a month ago service was horribly slow and food was terrible.  Was in the mood for Chinese tonight. Thought I would give it another try tonight, we got take out instead of dining in. It was just as bad. The girl checking us out didn't know what she was doing. As far as our food is was horrible too..There was maybe a half a hand full of the crispy rice noodles with the lettuce wraps..Nothing was good. Order Egg Rolls, we didn't even eat those just because everything else was just so nasty. The worst 40 dollars I have spent in a while. I am better off going to one of the Chinese places in a strip mall."
2,"The Palazzo Las Vegas Resort has the look, furnishings, and facilities of a 5-star establishment, but sorely lacks the service and fine details that normally accompany a top-notch hotel. \n\nHotel/Facilities:\n\nThe rooms are large and well designed. A slightly elevated bedroom section connects to a living room with its own 40-in TV, desk, and expansive couch. The bedroom section also has a flat panel TV. The king size bed I used was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. With that said, however, I hated how the night stands next to each side of the bed was basically unreachable if you were lying in bed. What is the point of having a night stand if I actually have to pull myself out of bed every single time I need to turn off the lamp, look at the clock, or put down a book?\n\nThe bathroom was expectedly grand. It included a separate shower, sauna, two sinks, and a toilet. As I alluded to earlier in my review, everything in the Palazzo that is related to the room or the facilities of the hotel are great, but it is the service that I have a serious problem with. \n\nService:\n\nFirst of all, our check-in process was long and delayed. At other high-end hotels on the strip, there are normally numerous front desk employees to serve you. Furthermore, even if there were large lines, there would be line ushers to guide you where to go. The Palazzo welcomed us with a very large, winding line, and it took my gf almost 25 minutes just to check in on a slow Monday (end of the memorial day weekend too!). \n\nSecondly, the amenities in the room are quite lacking. Besides the Motel-6 basics of a shampoo, soap, and conditioner, there were no q-tips, no shower cap, no cotton balls, no robes, and no slippers. I specifically requested for slippers and they did bring them to me, though I'd like the room to be stocked a little better so guests don't always have to ask for some of these mandatory bathroom items. \n\nLastly, it was literally impossible to get a hold of a person at the front desk. I have never been on hold so long in my life at a high-end hotel. I had to call three times just to get someone to answer the phone! We requested a late-checkout but was denied with a simple \""we are currently offering 12pm checkout.\"" Aren't most hotel establishments 12pm checkouts? Then why do you make it sound like you are doing ME a favor by \""offering\"" me a 12pm checkout? Absurd. \n\nOverall:\n\nIf you desire not only the look and feel of a 5-star hotel in Las Vegas, but also the service and fine amenities that are assumed to be included in such a rating, do NOT go to the Palazzo.  By far, Encore is still my personal favorite in the luxury hotel category in this city (see my review for further details)."
2,"I needed to buy a cable modem, so I dropped in to pick one up.  It was really easy to find what I was looking for and an employee helped explain the difference between the various models.  I opted for the basic one.....it was $10 cheaper than what Cox wanted to charge for theirs....score!\n\nOverall, a nice shopping experience.  Will definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
4,I have been a long time frequenter of this amazing coffee house. I don't pretend to be a coffee snob but I am an addict and this place makes the best lattes and coffee of any place I've ever been. The pastries are unreal and baked in house with love. \n\nThey recently opened their new addition and restaurant and I have to say that they have made a true iconic mark in downtown Phoenix. The menu is limited right now but everything we were served was great. Of course they still maintain their coffee house vibe and have sacrificed nothing in that area with the renovation. \n\nThis place is a must visit in Phoenix!
2,"after reading all the great reviews, we decided to give this place a try. being from orange county, i came here with very low expectations as i know that all the vietnamese restaurants that i am close to at home will not be comparable. first bad impression, service was exceptionally slow. there were three tables when we came in that hadn't receive their food yet. one party actually left because it took THAT LONG! There were two young guys running the show that day and they seemed really lost and flustered. The vietnamese coffee tasted like nestle coffee--it didn't have the strong aromatic taste with savory sweetness that I'm use to. When our bun bo hue and pho sate FINALLY came 30minutes later, we were starving. My pho sate was great and it was much tastier than the bun bo hue (although it wasn't bad either). They also skimped on the veggies. So many asian restaurants are popping up in Vegas--I probably wouldn't come back here unless I'm craving pho sate."
4,"Went on a trip for vegas this year for 7 days and this place was my #2 spot, aside from the Buffet at Cesars.\n\nWe ordered plenty of items from this place from the $7.77 meal which was awesome for the price! We also ordered the spicy nachos for an appetizer, was delicious. The nachos came with regular cheese as well as melted jalapeno cheese and sour cream. We were almost full after this!\n\nWe then ordered some flat bread pizzas - pepperoni and 4 cheese, which were also bomb!\n\nWe then came back a few hours later for deserts both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We ordered several shots, the banana split, and the alcoholic banana chocolate milkshake (wow, awesome!).\n\nThe first time we went there, the waitress had an attitude and I was going to rate it a 4, but when we went back the service was 5 stars, which this place deserves!"
1,"First of all we stayed at this hotel as part of a time share. When we arrived the Lobby wasn't really visibal or welcoming. We exited the car and walked in through the door to the front desk. The lady at the front desk seemed really nice and explained everything. The funny thing was that she said the shuttle stopped at 6:00pm and the return was never guaranteed. Isn't this vegas? Why does the shuttle stop running at 6?\n\nOn the way to the room we walked through one of the hallways that smelt like pizza, I am guessing its from the pizza place downstairs. Talk about bad vents. When we got into the room it smelt of hamburgers, I guess that ones of the bad things of a timeshare with a kitchen. We decided that we wouldn't be there all day so we just ignored it. \n\nThe room was an average timeshare room, I have seen better rooms. None of the views were great since they were all of empty lots. The pool was an indoor pool and the inside was really warm.\n\nWe went to the Timeshare the next morning. They told us the night before that it would be only 90 minutes. It ended up being three hours. It was funny our timeshare host was really nice to start off, once we told him that we were not interested the tables turned fast. He started to argue with me and kept saying that I was wrong. I guess he felt that since we were not going to buy he could go ahead and attack us. I wanted to bring out the sheet that said this is a no hassle presentation.\n\nIf you are thinking of going to Vegas you would be better off to go online and find a great deal for a room. Your in Vegas, are you really going to use a kitchen to cook, and you really don't need a shuttle that stops at 6."
2,"One knows, in general, what to expect from a shopping centre - you've got your high street fashion chains, your low- and mid-market accessory chains (Claire's, Accessorize), your coffee chain, your budget stationery shops, your DVD/game store, your chemist, the odd stall of bejewelled phone covers or pashminas or bags or hats... Tick, tick, repeated tick. Oh, and a Poundland, which is always a slightly guilty pleasure.\n\nNevertheless, despite all its generic box-ticking, I actually kind of like St James, certainly more than a number of other centres of its ilk. It's got lots of massage chairs for stressed shoppers to take a break in, for example - although the idea of sitting in a massage chair in public seems odd to me, but there is normally one occupied. It's also got a nice little customer service kiosk to help with general enquiries, which is a sweet touch that I don't think I've seen elsewhere, and also pretty handy as I tend to get lost. What is it about shopping centres that I can never work out the floorplan? Normally I have a pretty fiendish sense of direction but as soon as I'm in a mall my inner compass just goes NOPE.\n\nAnyway, if you know what you're looking for and you know where to find it, you'll probably find it in St James. I couldn't locate an iron, mind you, although I probably could have got one from John Lewis, which adjoins the centre rather like a wealthy godfather holding hands with his pleasant yet obviously less privileged charge."
1,"I had been so excited to try this place based on all the great reviews from fellow Yelpers. When the Groupon popped up, we snatched it up. \n\nI really wanted to love this place. I have to admit, I was a little (er, a lot) disappointed. We ordered the Prosciutto di Parma e Burrata appetizer to start. This was the highlight of the meal. The dish was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. It wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. I wasn't a big fan of meat sauce. Just a little on the bland side. My fella ordered the Petto di Pollo ai Funghi e Cipolline Borettane all'Agro and felt the same about his dish being a bit bland. My mom got the Lasagnette al Forno, which was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The food just felt underseasoned, which is odd for Italian food.\n\nAs another Yelper noted, the decor is a bit dated and I felt the food prices were on the expensive side for what you get.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Everyone at this restaurant was so welcoming and friendly. Attentive was the word of the day here. Even as someone who prefers a little anonymity in a restaurant I felt their attention was welcomed.\n\nThe service definitely outshone the food here, unfortunately."
2,"Very good food, decent service, and a very nice restaurant with a beautiful view. Extensive menu, A la Carte option is nice. Great for families. Beautiful bar with a strip view, too bad it's covered in poker machines. Very popular place. I live across the street, and most nights the cars are parked up along the street because the parking lot is full. \n\nGREAT margaritas."
3,"Who would turn down an opportunity to see the Blue Man Group? I remember seeing these guys about a couple years ago when they used to be at the Venetian. From what I recall, they would play music with weird objects, have electronic display games, have a couple different interactions with several audience members (especially the twinkie session), and lastly, the oh so hilarious ending which includes loads of toilet paper being spewed out on to the crowd. That right there pretty much describes this show in a nutshell.\n\nFor the new show, they retained about 75 percent of the original material. For this new one, they incorporated even more gadgets and the highlight of the show...........BALLS!\n\nYes, as if the show was not already chaotic with what they do on and off the stage, they had to throw in some balls. Huge ones at that. Big bouncy balls. Balls that could knock you out if thrown hard enough. Balls that.........ok you get my drift.\n\nKeep in mind these 3 guys do all this while pretty much having a straight face and no talking. It's hard to put on a good show if you don't even say a word the whole time.\n\nMinus the one star because there are a couple parts that was kind of dead and boring. No, I wasn't tired or anything. If you were though you would probably fall asleep. At least the finale is high energy action with fast music.\n\nOh, and before I forget, after the show a Blue Man or two will hang out either in the lobby or just inside the theater entrance so don't be in such a rush to leave. They will gladly take pics with you. What are they gonna say, no? Also, make sure you give props to the live band as well for they do a great job night in and night out. They will also be out there for your meet n greet opportunity. \n\nSo if you get the chance to watch this, go for it! Good for all ages."
3,Good place to start off the night! Pretty chill place with mellow crowd and laid back atmosphere. Drinks are reasonable considering the amount of alcohol they put in them.
1,"I think I would have enjoyed my visit to Sugar Factory much more if I had either A. Been able to order off the breakfast menu (WHY do places stop serving breakfast at 11am in Vegas?! Makes no sense to me) or B. Grabbed some confections on my way out. \n\nI was tired, hungover and in desperate need of some carbs when my girl friend and I hit up SF on our way out of town, so I wasn't too pleased to wait 20 minutes for a table only to see so many open tables in my immediate vicinity. But whatever, moving on. \n\nService was fine - nothing horrible but nothing to write home about. \n\nI ordered their signature burger for $17 which came on a scrumptious white chocolate bun. The burger itself was good but it arrived with tomatoes after I requested to have them left off, and cooked well done when I had kindly asked for medium rare. My friend ordered the French dip which she seemed to enjoy, and the spinach artichoke dip we had as a starter was good enough - not too chunky, not too runny - so all is not lost in the Sugar Factory kitchen. \n\nLunch for us girls including an alcoholic beverage each, an appetizer and two sandwiches came to a little over $70. I wouldn't say no to a return visit if someone suggested it, but I'm in no hurry to rush back."
2,"Watched a preseason laker game here against the sacramento kings and it was a fun experience as we pretty good seats.\n\nUpon arriving I told the attendant we had tickets and she pointed us in the line to purchase tickets which was rather long.  We stood in line for about 10 min before asking again to make sure and this time she said we didn't have to stand in line and we can just go in, wtf man what a waste of time!\n\nLines for food and drinks were rather lengthy and took awhile."
2,"If I still smoked weed (okay, if I was high) this place would be fucking heaven. Random mixes of spicy food that's not that great for you, fried stuff with cheese all served in a goddamn tinfoil pan.\n\nAs everyone I know either loves or hates this place, I finally made it out tonight and, well, my first paragraph sums up how I feel.\n\nTry it, at least once. It's interesting, has some definite winners (the Cuban beans were GREAT) and you might just find yourself a new place to go under the influence.\n\nIf not, well, at least your colon will be clean in the morning."
4,"My favorite canal restaurant. The menu is very inventive although they have no problem charging for their food and cocktails. All their specialty drinks are very tasty (the Black Cherry Lemonade is awesome) but expensive. The views are great the place feels very comfortable inside, a great bar and good tables. I really watch what I eat and Kitchen 56 has some great menu options for low carb low fat items. They even have some vegetarian choices which is always nice to see. \nWhile the prices are high I believe I get good value for my money. I am not going to go here to drink all day but stopping in during a bike ride on the canal is great (they do give a 10% discount for bike riders)."
3,"inside the cosmo hotel, so course everything is so glam...\n\nthe buffet food is really cute. there are small dishes in lil pots or baskets so you can try a lil of everything. even my server was super nice. always refilling our drinks and he even went and got us some sauces for our meat. \n\ni love the salami. i just couldn't get enough. \nthe bbq ribs, kalbi, chicken wings, prime rib, green beans were all tasty.\nthe desserts are super cute and pretty tasty. loved the lemon tart and cream brulee\nthe fruit was swt and fresh.\n\nthe buffet is really clean.\n\nsome things got too hard and cold so didn't taste good. \nmac and cheese-bland and hard\nlamb meat balls-gross\nshort ribs-the short rib was good, but the veges were nasty and came with super lil meat\n\n\ngets packed fast and i would come back to try more things."
1,"I've stayed at the Excalibur about a dozen times from childhood to now, and although it's not the cleanest and classiest hotel, it's still fun to visit. The primary reason I come to the Excalibur now is to go to the fun dungeon, but they have totally cheaped out on their games and toys. I'd rather visit Circus Circus for the games, but I still come to Excalibur for nostalgia."
4,"I love when I try a restaurant and love it so much that I start planning my next visit before I leave!!!\nWe got there around 9pm Monday night and they had an awesome happy hour going on!\nAlready off to an awesome start!!!!\nWe started with the meat and chz app.  I loved the variety on the plate!  \nAll of the sandwich options sounded so stinkin good!!! So hard to decide!\nFinally, I decided on the roast beef and cheese and the hubby got the grilled chz option.  Both were to die for! Yum!\nI can't wait until the weather gets nicer so we can sit on the patio and bring one of our pups.  Even with the summer nights the patio was packed tho! \nI loved TMI!"
1,"Klein's is located near my home, so I decided to get some of my vegetable plants for my garden there.  First off, if you are claustrophobic, probably not the place for you. I felt they packed way too many things in their greenhouses, and the walking paths are narrow. They shouldn't even allow carts throughout because it's too cramped. When it's busy there, it's extremely hard to get around in there. I found myself getting very crabby and wanting to walk out. Also, watch where you are walking - very uneven ground, cords and boards laying around.\nI decided to get a few pepper plants there as they have a variety that I really like.  My sister also bought this variety. A few weeks later after planting, we both started seeing problems in our gardens. The plants had been diseased, and it was spreading to other crops. The disease spread to other pepper plants that I purchased from elsewhere. It's very frustrating to put a lot of work and effort in to a garden, and now I'm not going to have any yield in peppers.  Thanks Klein's! :("
2,"The babagnaoush is fantastic, but everything else was just so-so. My husband on the other hand, REALLY liked it. I might have to give it another try just to be certain, but as it stands, meh, I can take it or leave it."
2,"We walked here from the last monorail stop in 112 degree heat because I thought it was going to be that good, it wasn't."
2,"This is for the dip and dance Thursdays which, as I understand, is Surrender... but without the dance floor (which is technically Encore Beach Club, at night). \n\nWe had a day bed which was perfectly located in the middle for our viewing pleasure. Very comfortable beds and they had little cubbies for our belongings. Well thought out. \n\nThe larger bar was right behind us and was well staffed and easily accessible. Practically no wait. \n\nThe evening started with a one-hour champagne bar for the ladies, which was much appreciated, and was served up by very friendly and accommodating bartenders (one of whom was Luis, who we became fans of- he even took pictures for us!) \n\nOur servers were also wonderful. If you ever get Casey, tip him well, because he makes sure you're taken care of. \n\nAs for the event, you can get in with pool attire, which was hard for me to wrap my head around. Here I was at Encore, at night, clubbing, in flip flops, and about to jump in the pool without consequence. Pretty awesome. \n\nOh, for the guys... no free drinks, but ladies dancing in the middle of the pool on a platform... perhaps that's a fair trade?"
3,"There are many celebrity chefs flooding the Vegas market. Emeril has been here for awhile so I think his standard fair at his restaurants are tested and true recipes with service that has been honed over time. When going to an Emeril restaurant you are most likely going to have a good meal with good service.\n\nMy mother and I ate here for lunch on their Restaurant Week 2014 menu. My one and only dining experience for this season's RW, unfortunately. We arrived shortly after they opened and were seated in the empty front dining area. Our server was prompt and courteous, continually checking on us throughout the meal and our drinks were topped off consistently.\n\nMy mother and I both started off with the Boston Salad that came with big, leafy greens, giant tomatoes, big chunks of bacon, and buttermilk ranch dressing with fresh cracked black pepper. Phenomenal! I could have this salad just as an entree and be fine. The quality of the lettuce was exceptional and each bite was crisp and enjoyable.\n\nNext, my mother chose the peach roasted chicken and I wish I had gotten it too! It was flavorful, tender, and juicy, with a crispy skin, and spiced perfectly. It came with a savory bread pudding and grilled mushrooms. \n\nI opted for the lobster ravioli which was disappointing. While the raviolis themselves were well cooked and stuffed nicely with lobster the tomato butter it was served in was terribly off-putting for me and I really disliked the Cajun flavor to it (I know, Emeril's cooking style IS Cajun!), but still just not great in my opinion and very lackluster. It came topped with cuts of asparagus and not even they could pick the dish up.\n\nLastly, dessert was delish. I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake, which was so so decadent, but fluffy and sinfully sweet. My mother opted for the very famous banana cream pie (which I have had before), and she said it was exquisite. \n\nOverall the disappointment in my main entree was balanced by the good service, salad, and dessert. I am sure this miss with the entree is an exception, not a consistency."
0,"I used to work as a hostess at this place and I had the worst experience at work that I have ever had. First off, the place does not have security cameras and one of the host has been caught steeling money before. Her name is Kaylin and she still works there I believe. When I was first hired, the manager, Grady, said I should leave my purse in my car. I told him I had personal things I would need and I was not comfortable with that. The first day, I put my purse in his office, after my shift, he said that was not allowed. \n\nOne day, I came in for my shift and put my purse in the hostess shelf. I forgot that I had cash in my purse from getting paid to house- sit. I bussed one table then went to grab my purse and put it in my car. I had only been at work for about 5 minutes and when I looked in my bag $200 was missing!! I'll admit it is not smart to carry cash around but I had just been paid that day and I should have felt safe with it in my work place. After I saw the money was gone I confronted the other hostesses immediately. They all denied any knowledge. I was positive the money was in my purse because I came to work directly from getting it and didn't have time to stop by the bank. I went to explain the situation to the Grady the manager, and his response was \""that's too bad, I cant help you\"". What kind of manager just lets that go on and completely ignores it?! I then went to the other manager, Justin and he shrugged his shoulders! If an employee has been caught stealing before and just did it again shes probably stealing tips off the tables too! \n\nI quit the job on the spot and told them that it was a terrible environment to work in. Grady did not even confront the host about the stolen money. His constant response was \""its not my problem\"". What kind of management ignores an issue like that? If it was $20, It wouldn't be a huge deal, this girl deliberately stole $200 from me and the mangers did nothing. They are definitely not trust worthy and not  very committed to running a respectable business if they can't even treat their employees right. I am disgusted with this place and I would never step foot in this restaurant. Grady is a total A**!!!!"
3,"I've been twice so far, both times...great nail job. I got acrylics with gel overlay, they do a meticulous job. This spot is clean,  well priced (my full set with gel overlay was only $30), and the service is great too. After having some very disappointing experiences at two different shops near my work, I am so glad to have found a reliable nail salon that I can count on for consistently perfect looking nails. Yay!"
4,Came in for lunch. Had excellent two-for-one drinks. Had barbecue chicken pizza and calamari and blackened tilapia. Everything tasted fantastic and the service was really good and fast. And the prices are great as well.
1,"I like this club and the setup.  I have been here a couple of times and it is a mixed bag of quality of comic that you will see but generally they are pretty good.  The audience size varies greatly from one show to another.  I have been there when it was packed and another time where there were 25 people there.\n\nThis venue is kind of hard to find if you don't know there is an upstairs which is probably the reason for the crowds being small at times.  They really need to promote it more because of the poor location in the building.\n\nIf location on the strip isn't the reason you picked Riviera, you would be better off at Bally's comedy club.\n\nhttp://www.rivierahotel.com/las-vegas-entertainment/comedy-club/"
3,"I heard this place stacks fries and cole slaw onto your sandwich so I gotta try it. I ordered the drunk duck drink and it was fantastic. I got to keep the little rubber ducky on top of my drink too :)  As for the sandwich, I got the deluxe double egg and cheese.  The portion was HUGE and very messy!  More messy than boogers coming out from a runny nose.  The sandwich I got was really good and filling.  I would recommend this place for visitors from afar and who happens to be in the neighborhood."
0,Who ever rated more than 1 start doesn't know real Chinese food! I regret spending a penny there. And also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job.
1,Honestly this place gets all it's hype just because it's on the strip! I love the frozen meat by the entrance and the chefs cooking in front of you but the food isn't all that great. Got the salmon-blackened and bf got the regular size filet medium and they were burnt on the outside not really a good grill taste. If you want good steaks try the station casino steakhouses! Just a couple dollars cheaper but with way more selection and very delicious! I am a local so I know... Came here for my bf's birthday and wasn't what we expected... Sadly (shrug)
1,"I am a fat kid at heart, so I love buffets. When I go to a Vegas buffet, I expect a top-of-the-line buffet for $29.95, not a knockoff of the Hometown Buffet.\n\nThe selection here was rather minimal. They had a dessert bar, a taco bar, prime rib, a salad bar, and a seafood bar. Nothing out of the ordinary in terms of selection or taste.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving this the dreaded one-star review were the crab legs. Oh sweet baby Jesus, they were amazing. They were pre-sliced, so you didn't need a hammer to crack it open. If you've never had crab legs, they are heavenly. It's so easy to eat a few dozen because they are that good.\n\nAs much as I Ioved the crab legs, I still felt like the MGM Grand's buffet wasn't as grand as some of the other buffets on The Strip -- or even off The Strip. I felt like I just threw away $30, to be completely honest. Never again."
2,Great place to watch sporting events. \nLots of TV's. \nLots of drink. \nLots of good food. \nThe bloody Mary was really good!\n\nLittle on the pricey side.
1,"Good for a quick, cheap meal. I had the orange chicken and enjoyed it. My boyfriend had teriyaki chicken, which he did NOT enjoy, and he found the miso soup watery and too salty. This is not healthy Japanese food, that's for sure. If this place was right down the street, I would probably return when I need cheap food quickly, but since it's a fifteen-minute drive for me, I will most likely not be back."
1,"I used to love shopping at Glazier's. USED to love it. Today I went in for my usual Monday morning grocery run. Since I have a new iPhone I wanted to take a photo to post with my Yelp review. So I'm over by the bakery section and this employee comes out and just starts yelling at me \""You can't take pictures in here! That is AGAINST COMPANY POLICY!\"" And on and on and on. I mean, what kind of store doesn't allow photography of any kind? Makes me wonder what the hell they are trying to hide! \n\nSo after this incident I asked where the stated policy was that said \""no photos.\"" No signs posted anywhere. But when I started looking around the store, I noticed more and more customer un-friendly signs. \""All backpacks and bags must be checked.\"" \""We can refuse service to anyone.\"" \""All bakery boxes will be opened and checked.\"" And top it off, the store has these hulky looking security guards that wander the store and will follow you around! Glazier's makes me feel like a thief! I've concluded that you should only shop here if you want to be made to feel like a second class citizen or shoplifter. Seriously!\n\nI'm really sad about this because it is such a nice store. Great produce and while it's too expensive for everyday grocery shopping, the wide aisles and wide assortment make it fun to look around. \n\nOf course, one dissatisfied customer is worse than having 100 happy customers because, believe me, I am going to share this story with everyone I know. I don't think Glazier's wants to upset the upper middle class community so they might want to rethink the unfriendliness of the store. Instead of shopping at Glazier's, it's going to be Whole Foods only for me."
0,When I called I started talking and she said hold and put me on hold about 5 mins later she finally got back on and was very rude.\n\nWill not send people there!!!!
3,"A solid 4.5...just shy of a 5.\n\nMy stars:  (5=epic \""best of\"") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)\n\nGo or No?  Go!\n\nTease:   Iron Chef Bobby Flay's Southwestern restaurant in Caesar's Palace (right by their sports book)\n\nWhy I went:  Because I am a fan of Flays!\n\nWhen:  11/18/12\n\nFood:  I had the Mesa Burger...I was craving a high quality burger for lunch as we were there early in the afternoon.  We had a total group of 4 dining.  Other entrees included the grouper, pulled pork sandwich, and bacon quesadilla.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  A number of us also enjoyed their amazing and spicy Bloody Mary's!  I've eaten here a number of times.  Every time, I really have enjoyed my meals!  The flavors are so vibrant and interesting.  Things can be spicy, so if you like that...you'll love Mesa Grill!    Basically the food & drinks are delicious!\n\nService:   Mike P was our server, and he did a fine job.  \n\nHints/Final thoughts:   The food here is really super tasty!  However, the only real complaint is that a lot of the dishes are not changeable.  Given many marinades, sauces, and preparation...apparently, they can't make many substitutions.  For my wife, who can't eat cilantro, this made ordering a little difficult.  They will try, but sometimes there can't be much done."
2,"Great service and clean place,  as for the food it was around the typical chinese food buffet style, they did offer a mongolian and sushi section.\nThey had quite a few isles with a variety of different items, some you don't find at a  regular Chinese buffet."
4,"After trying the Bellagio Spa with their gazillion treatment rooms, hordes of tourists and sheep herd mentality, this place was such a welcome relief.  I was the only one there for the two hours I was at the spa.  The staff were incredibly friendly, and the facilities are second to none.  Be sure to lounge in their hot water spa in the metal chaise lounges, and try the mood showers that offer different experiences of sound, water and music like Rain Forest and Arctic Chill.  This place is pricey like all spas in Vegas."
1,"Las Vegas is the capital of the hospitality industry. I used to be in the hospitality industry, so when I go to Las Vegas I am eager to be wowed, but my expectations are reasonable because I also understand the restrictions that establishments have. \n\nSo this review is as fair as it gets. \n\nShort version of this review: \n\n1. Unbearable pulsing hum outside my room kept me up all night. \n2. Food made me throw up in the morning. \n3. What looked like blood spots on my friend's sheets grossed us out. (We later found out this was from the rust in the driers. Doesn't matter, fix it, get on top of your game!) \n4. No compensation for any of this, no recovery on the part of the establishment. \n5. STILL CHARGED ME FOR THE FOOD THAT MADE ME THROW UP AND MISS HALF OF MY CLASSES FROM MY CONVENTION! WHAT?! Yup, that's MGM, I guess. \n\nLong Version:\n\nMy experience at the MGM grand was not only a disappointment, it was appalling. Worst of all, MGM knew about my issues and DIDN'T OFFER ME A THING to compensate for this. In the hospitality industry, we call this part the \""recovery\""...it would appear the MGM Grand Hotel and casino has never even heard of this concept. \n\nI was in Vegas for a convention for which I paid a pretty penny. I got to my hotel and the check in desk people were VERY pleasant. I then got to my room and prepared for a restful night after a long drive...NOPE, sorry, a nonstop pulsing hum coming from god knows where kept me up. I slept two hours. \n\nThe following day I slept 4 hours, but the hum was gone, so this time it could be the copious amounts of oxygen pumped into my room to keep me up and gambling. \n\nBut the worst part was this: I ordered some room service after not eating at all for 12 hours. The guy who delivered it was AWESOME too. Great guy, got a great tip. The following morning, after sleeping 6 hours in two nights, I wake up at 6am with a migraine and nausea. I threw up my entire meal. Being sick, I also missed 2 invaluable classes that I can never get back. MGM COST ME MONEY AND KNOWLEDGE! \n\nI reported this, a gentlemen came and got my information and details of the incident. I assumed this would allow them to make things right. But no. My food was on my bill upon check out and I insisted that they remove it. They did so without hesitation, but then the food showed up on my credit card bill! WHAT!? I couldn't even help them recover myself??? \n\nA lady got back to me a week later telling me she investigated my incident. She said no other reports were made about the salmon that night, basically subtly suggesting that it was something else despite knowing I hadn't eaten anything before their meal. But here's the thing, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF NO ONE ELSE GOT ILL, I did! No one else getting ill only shows that the salmon wasn't stored improperly, but it could still be prepared improperly as surfaces and utensils can affect the salmon in a case by case basis. \n\nMy friend also had some gross spots in his room after waiting 30 minutes for his room to be ready. He said they looked like blood. Later, it was explained that the spots are rust from the dryers. That's not an excuse, fix this! \n\nThe staff was very pleasant at MGM which earns them 2 stars. But if you're in the capital of the hospitality industry, act the part."
3,"This tiny place is where I got my first slice of pizza in Montreal on a visit about 3 years ago now. It really set the tone for that sleazy downtown Montreal vibe with a peep show right next door and the Bell center just down the road. The price of the slices hasn't gone up since then, still $2.50 for any variety. The crust here is above par, and the spinach pizza is my fav. Get all the fixings - pepper flakes, parmesan, and olive oil - and chow down."
2,$80 for 2 people $7 for parking & $8 for a locker .... Yep I'll never go there again beside the line for the rides are to long
1,"I haven't been impressed with BJ's the last couple times I've visited and I'm not going back. I am newly gluten free and they have limited menu options for a GF person like me although I do appreciate that they offer a GF pizza. I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad. It was certainly nothing special considering the $12 price tag. I was disappointed to see that all their salads ran that much with the exception of the garden salad which was $9.75 + $3 extra to add grilled chicken. They've really increased their prices. My husband's vanilla Dr. Pepper was $3 and he was not offered a refill. So, like I said, I won't be returning."
3,"This place is really good.  And, it's a great value.\n\nMy favorite item so far is their salad - the one they serve with the meal.  It's beyond delicious.  I tried their namesake dish (the Baked RigaTony) and it was just OK.  But, everything else I've had there was wonderful."
1,Celebrated a special occasion here. Two of us ordered seafood dishes.  Both got sick in the middle of the night. Should have ordered steak like the others in our party - they were fine the next day.  Had seafood here once before when the restaurant first opened years ago. It too was bad.  Should have learned the first time. Will not make the same mistake again.  DO NOT eat the seafood!
0,Would have rated a 0 star but could not... Pathetic course conditions... Its April for petes sake... The staff was very rude and inconsiderate... No water at all in ball washers or even the ball washer on the cart... Will not recommend or play this course again...
1,"I went here for breakfast with my mom and daughter.  My mom and I have been here before about 3 years ago and we remembered it being good.\n\nWe went on a Sunday so it was busy, but we only had to wait 10 minutes or so to be seated which was nice.  It is a cute \""dive\"" type of restaurant.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and great, she got our drinks and orders fast, refilled, etc...\n\nThe food however was very dssapointing.\n\nI got french toast with sausage and eggs.  The eggs were ok, the sausage was ok, but the french toast was sub-par.  The toast was a little soggy and bland.\n\nMy mom got pancakes and sausage.  She said the pancakes were alright but kind of flavorless and her sausage was tough.\n\nMy daughter went for lunch and got the french dip and onion rings.  She did not like the french dip at all.  The meat was very, very dry and had no seasoning.  Unfortunately, the meat did not taste fresh either and really grossed me out.  She ate her onion rings which I tried and those were actually good.\n\nWe also ordered a side of biscuits to try since we were craving them and they were really bad.  They were dry and not soft.  Next to the french dip, these were the worst.\n\nI was sad because when I ate here a few years ago I remember it being very yummy. (I had gone a few times in the past).  I will probably not go back.  I hope their food gets better, service was fine."
3,this is pretty cool poker room.. a few different tournaments everyday.. and the $1/$2 tables is pretty good.. the crowd however tends be all guys.. but i guess that's with poker in general
4,I very much enjoyed my sandwich. The service was excellent. They sliced the meat and even gave me samples as well. The bread is less chewie than subway. The prices are the same as subway. It is a family owned business so i choose to support that any day. Five stars on every level.
4,"Just saw Jabba at Harrah's in Atlantic City, and have to say that the show was AMAZING. Wow. The dancing, the special effects, the illusions, the comedy... everything was just so, so entertaining. We saw some favorite bits from abdc, too, like the mj dance as well as robot remains. It's cool to see it on TV but it's about 10x cooler to actually see these amazing dancers in front of you. Go see the show! Jabba!"
4,The hotel was nice the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The wine and coffee hours are a nice bonus. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My 3 year old son left his favorite stuffed animal in our room. We didn't realize until we were home. Erica in housekeeping went out of her way to get the frog back to us.  I would stay there again because of the excellent service.
4,"Sooooooo(oooooo...) delicious!\n\nI came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!\n\nBeing at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.\n\nWe started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....\n\nI had the \""healthy\"" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.\n\nMy pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.\n\nThe only \""misses\"" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.\n\nOur bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!\n\nFYI, the large patio space is deceiving...it is actually shared with the coffee shop and oyster bar (not yet open as far as I know), so I cannot imagine there will ever be a time without a large wait for group patio seating.\n\nLots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?  \n\nOur meal benefited Make A Wish Arizona - the founding Make A Wish chapter, if you didn't know!"
0,Horrible  customer service . Me and my girlfriend got a text from sin city vaporsIV on tropicana and 215. stating that we can get 3 bottles for 15$ on our next purchase. Excited and  Walked in the store and the guy (jeremy) did not know what we were talking about. We felt stupid that the company sends a text and we go out to the store to find out that it was false So we decided to leave AND upset Got in the car.  Decided to give a second chance. Had to call the other stores just to verify that the text was correct . All that could of been avoided if the employees was informed. The worst part was that jeremy was not even giving a shit about us when we came back asking if we needed any help or anything that might be a good choice or help us out with any juices . when we were done shopping we had to wait for him to get done talking before he helped us i asked for 2 peguses 2 magnifico and 2 snozberry. Great we were finally done. Got home and found out that he gave us two wrong fucking juices out of the six we bought . WTF!!!!!!!!! Total bad experience total bad customer service. Never going back. Would not recommend. Would have gave no stars but had to for the review.
1,"It's my, hmm, I don't know, maybe 10 years of attending CES. Yes, we all geeks and rocket scientists do get to gather and socialize even once a year. And when we do, we do it in a big way, Vegas-style, of course.  And on one night, we had to take one of our clients for dinner.\n\nEnter Sensi...this after we've called a few dozen restaurants for a reservation with no luck. \n\nSo yes, Sensi was our last resort and I'm absolutely glad dinner was on company expense because if I was going to pay for it on my own, you won't see me here. \n\nNo value whatsover for your money.\n\nLet me explain, lest my review is removed again for lack of \""first-hand experience\"" (yeah, whatever).\n\nLet's start with the menu. Well, it's limited and  a mish-mash of Asian and Italian-inspired dishes, with a couple of meats and fishes thrown in as a after-thought. And, oh, they don't have any special.\n\nThe service was lacking or rather we didn't see the server unless we call him. And I won't normally do that in a restaurant. Besides, it's his job to regularly check on his table. Not the other way around where I have to see who's missing something on our party and tell  it to the server. \n\nAnd when we're served with what we have ordered, well, I'm speechless. Speechless because I can't really say something about it. And take it as a bad thing. It just lacked some umph. I was really hoping that dessert would somehow save Sensi, but no.\n\nLike a song, Sensi is one-note, monotonous. Didn't fire up my senses whatsover. Makes sense?"
2,"If I'm ever at The District, it is usually for the restaurants and never for the shopping! \n\nThey have some pretty good restaurants/eateries here: Elephant Bar, Lucille's, Crazy Pita, etc. I went to Rachel's Kitchen and got this really awesome Watermelon drink that was sooo refreshing on this one particular summer day! They also have Panera Bread, PF Chang's, with Cheesecake Factory & Whole Foods across the way. \n\nThe stores here are a little more on the higher end side. They have William Sonoma, Athropologie, Pottery Barn, etc. I do always make it a habit to check out Flea Bag's Bakery & Bowtique. Even though I don't have a dog myself up here in Vegas, I like to check out all the fresh treats they have and their small selection of cat stuff. \n\nDid I mention that The District is dog friendly? I see people walking their dogs and they have those poop stations with the poop bags. My friend said they took their dog, and the boyfriend was waiting outside because he didn't think he could take their dog in the store, but the store associate said that the dogs are welcome in there as well. I think just some of the food establishments have a no dogs beyond this point type of thing. Understandable.\n\nIt is a very nice shopping center. It an outdoor center, but even on a summer day, I found it was rather cool with the buildings blocking most of the sun. I do agree that parking does suck.. especially by Lucille's. That place gets really croweded on the weekend nights.. and I think they block off the back part of the parking lot for valet."
4,Great chicken shawarma and a really yummy falafel wrap. Nice place. You may find parking right outside. I will be back again soon.
2,"There is pretty much a Walgreens on every street corner and this one is no different from the others. Staff is friendly and are usually willing to help. The pharmacist Muna, is extremely helpful if you need any health or medical assistance. Overall, its Walgreens however, there isn't a redbox, which is inconvenient."
4,"I love Botanical Tans! Erica is great, very professional and super nice. My spray tans look great and they are healthy and chemical free which is very important to me since I have a new baby. I will never go back to auto booth tanning."
4,"Went a week ago for a hot stone massage pedicure. The paint and design still looks great, despite a week in flip-flops! The staff was friendly and professional, I'll definitely come back during future trips to Vegas, even if it is a little pricey."
2,"In a mood for Cheesecake Factory pasta?  This place just might be for you. One thing though I can't deny: ingredients are top notch. IMHO the thought is there, but execution... Not so much. They seem to doing ok, and semi-busy on Saturday night, so I guess no need to change anything, but IMHO, which I'm sure no one cares, pull back on sauce, ingredients and raw flavors of your pasta are excellent and don't need to be rescued from drowning in deep, creamy death! If you decide to visit this place- try their potato gnocchi. It's very good."
4,"Being from San Francisco/ Bay area in Ca, ramen is tough to beat anywhere else but this place knocks it out of the park.  Absolutely love their ramen and fried rice.  The kimchi fried rice is super good.  Cooked to just the right texture of rice filled with flavor.  The ramen is perfectly chewy and the soup really hits the spot on a cold day! The place is a bit small ans gets crazy busy during nights.  So heed the warning of the other regulars who reviewed on here and go ahead of time to enjoy your dinner!!"
0,"So disappointed ! We read the reviews and headed over, thinking about Lobster Tacos.\n\nParking was a nightmare, poor signage for those of us from out of town. Strolled the grounds looking for the entrance to the resturant, beautiful grounds with all the Christmas lights maned carousel.  The aromas in the air as we entered we so inviting. \n\nThe hostesses were very friendly, but seem surprised we'd be there to dine when we weren't staying there.  Sat us right away, in the corner by the kitchen. The hostess was the only staff we ever spoke with.  Water was poured then we sat and sat and sat and sat.  After 10 minutes (maybe a little more) we hadn't received a \""Hello\"" \""I will be right with you\"" or any kind of greeting so we left.\n\n Perhaps if we'd been a guest at the Fairmont we would have had better service and we would of had the opportunity to experience the Lobster Tacos others raved were so good."
1,"We took a family party of 8 to Portofino's tonight, having enjoyed it several times in the past. No one was waiting when we arrived, and the hostess pointed to a large table that was finishing up, saying that we would be seated in 10 to 15 minutes after the table was cleaned. When the party left, the hostess led a party of 10, who had arrived well after us, to that table. We were told that they were going to push two tables together for us and it would just be a few minutes longer. When another party was seated at the only empty table, my dad asked how much longer it would be, and the hostess rudely said, \""We don't have a table for you. You can wait 30 minutes or leave.\"" We chose to leave and won't be back."
0,"So, I used to come here often, but now I am never going back.\n\nI went in today to pick up some chicken salad and some groceries for dinner. I walked over to the deli area, looking around for what I'd like and while I'm looking, I took a picture of my shirt for a friend, and send it to him. Then this little woman from the deli walks over to me and says \""hey, excuse me, who are you and why are you taking pictures?\"" in a very rude tone! I was stunned at first and could only mutter \""..of myself??\"" and she says \""well I wanna know who you think you are and why you're taking pictures of my shelf\"" and walked away.. I couldn't believe it! I got my chicken salad and went to grab a basket for my groceries, and she started following me!! By this point, I was starting to get really embarrassed, but I wanted to get my stuff and go. As I am walking down the isles, she continues to follow me until \""manager\"" Lisa tells me I can't be taking pictures of the store and calls me out in front of everyone, at no point did anyone ask me what I was doing, or apologize for stalking me, they just decided to embarrass me and make me never want to come back ever again.\n\nAfter that, I bought just the chicken salad and almost ran out of the store, tears in my eyes from embarrassment. \n\nI will never shop at any Albertsons again."
4,"Large number and wide variety of butterflies and moths.  Excellent customer service, especially Max who goes out of his way to help everyone have a great experience (texting people to let them know when their favorite butterflies and moths are in the pavilion; lending bright vests to kids to increase chances that a butterfly will land on them)."
0,I should have read the other reviews before I ate here! This placed isn't gonna last too long. I had the Butter Chicken Naan-Wich and the chicken was weirdly hard like it's been sitting for awhile. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry! Fortune cookies are good though!
3,"Judging by some of the reviews, maybe I went on good days because I've enjoyed my trips.  Good food and good service.  \n\nThe last time I went, I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday, ordered an All~Star Burger with BBQ sauce and enjoyed some sports.  The bartender was nice and the food came quick, which was good because I was hungry (I inhaled the burger).\n\nI'll be returning on a regular basis once football starts back up."
1,Saw some good yelp reviews expected more from this place. I recently got into juicing so I was super excited when I heard they have juices too. \n\nGot the Bison cheese steak in a spinach wrap. It was comparable to taco bell taco meat. And the tofu fries were pretty good just too salty on the outside edges. \n\nI also got the wellness drink. Never saw any of the ingredients I read on the board being run through a juicer. Saw some stuff going into a blender though. THAT'S NOT JUICING.
1,"This McDonald's is located inside the Excalibur hotel and was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Mickey D's. We wanted a quick breakfast at around 9:30 a.m., so my friend decided to grab some for us to bring back to the room before heading out for the day. He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich. By the time we got the food back to the room it was cold, but at least the coffee stayed warm."
2,Fast service. Decent price. Greasy food.
4,"If you live in Scottsdale, and have yet to visit this park, you are an idiot. First and foremost, I want to commend the city of Scottsdale for preserving such a large sector of land, and transforming it into a fabulous park. (Especially in a city where mountain property is the creme-de-la-creme of real estate)\n\nI had an afternoon all to myself the other day, and felt like doing some exploring. I often find myself at the Arabian Library studying, and gazing out the window at the gorgeous mountains so close by. I figured I'd just scoot up Thompson Peak Road and see what I found. Lucky for me, I stumbled across the Gateway trailhead. Pulled into a spacious parking lot, though dirt, so don't get mad if you car is a little dusty! Threw on my Camelbak, and looked for a map. At the trailhead, there's a building with restrooms, maps, and models of the entire preserve. Awesome. Grabbed a map, picked the Windgate Pass trail, and set off. I was gone for a good few hours, and completely underestimated the length of the trails. I also should have brought some sunscreen! :(. I got to the Inspiration Viewpoint, which is truly inspirational. The views here are pure bliss. \n\nI was going to keep going, but 4 o'clock crept up on me, and I had to get home. Trudged through the path, and found myself at the Gateway Loop again. I like the way the trails here are set up. From the Gateway trailhead, the Gateway Loop Path circulates and connects with all the other paths. I'm not real fond of the Bell Pass trail, but the Windgate and Tom's Thumb are marvelous. \n\nAll in all, go. It's fun, easy to navigate, and a great way to stay fit while soaking up our beautiful Arizona weather at the same time. The city of Scottsdale may not do many things well, but its Parks Department is one of it's prime assets, and the McDowell Sonoran Preserve is a true gem."
4,"This has to be my favorite fast food joint! I love love love their chicken! I always get their number 1 meal. It's their basic chicken sandwich with the world famous waffle fries. The customer service that you get their is stellar!  Oh, and they have the best sweet tea ever!"
2,"Affordable?  Yes.  Fresh?  Mostly.  Cramped?  Yup.  Slow?  Absolutely. Worth it?  Depends on how much you like sushi.\n\nThose that rave about this place really don't know quality sushi.  Harsh perhaps, but true.  I went all nigiri here; I appreciate that all fish has its Japanese name, even though the server couldn't understand my white-guy pronunciation.  Anyways, some things I tried were fresh, some were clearly thawed from frozen.  Some items that I ordered were subbed out, (e.g. I ordered ama ebi, got ebi...that'd be like ordering raw tuna, and receiving fried catfish).  and some simply were not served (where's the hamachi)?  \n\nIt was by no means terrible, and for the price I would go again, but don't expect to get blown away here.  NZ cafe is affordable sushi in a strip mall, no more, no less."
3,"My husband selected SW based on the most discerning of evaluation processes..he saw Dwayne Wade come out of SW on a previous trip while we were at Parasol Down. Yes folks, that is why we dined there. \n\nThe space is very nice and finds a nice balance between trendy and classy, erring on the side of classy. (This is the Wynn afterall). The waitstaff was top notch and dealt with our rather loud party with grace, although I'm sure they have seen much worse. We were just loud. \n\nThe wine list left much to be desired so I selected a martini- pear lychee- that was actually quite good. I'm normally not a fan of sweet drinks but this had a real pear sweetness to it and not an artificial flavor. We started with oysters, 2 types, which 2 of our friends loved. My husband thought they were very good, but not the best (reserved for NOLA Gulf oysters). \n\nFor my entree I selected the scallops, which were some of the best, if not the best, that I've had since moving out west. One of my friends and I switched entrees halfway through so I could sample the seared tuna, which I found to be incredibly mediocre. The serving size was large but the lack of flavor detracted from the dish. My husband selected the filet mignon, which he said was just mediocre, only because it was a little overcooked. He had asked for medium and thought it was closer to medium-well, there wasn't much pink in the middle - since a filet is a fat piece of steak, medium usually means slightly charred on the outside but still pink in the middle (as opposed to medium rare which is slightly charred on the outside and very pink on the inside, or rare which is charred on the outside and red on the inside). \n\nIn the end the bill for a party of 7 came to about $500 which I think is more than reasonable for the caliber of steakhouse that SW is. I would return to SW and I'm sure I will recommend it to friends."
4,"So happy to see Fired Pie at this location. To tell you the truth they are really taking the Valley by storm. Love the concept and service. The pies are always cooked to perfection, salads fresh and plentiful and you can't beat the Bellini! Way to go Fired Pie!"
3,"Can't beat this place for a great and relatively inexpensive Vegas meal. We make sure to eat here every time we are in town. They have an awesome veggie burger and tons of toppings like picked green tomatoes, fried egg, asparagus, blue cheese and so many more.. to create your own burger experience. The skinny fries are also to die for. Relaxed atmosphere... love sitting at the bar. They also have really good beer on tap!"
3,*4 stars* for their red velvet cupcakes =)
4,"My Brother who lives in Chandler took my Mom and Me to the Lux Cafe and I loved the food, I had the Kentucky Hot Brown which was very tasty and my Mom and Bro. had the Pot Pie which was huge and very good as well, the dessert we had was also yummy (it was not cheesecake). When I arrived I mentioned that this place looks just like the Cheesecake Factory I'm sure it's a sister w/a slight different menu, I will definitely return, lucky for me there is one in Beverly Hills..."
4,"Everything great you have read about Zizzo is true.  The service and fit are so good that you'll be going through your closet looking for more things to bring in.  You owe it to yourself to see how snappy you can look in well-tailored clothes, plus Phil will make you laugh - what more can you ask for?   Don't waste time anywhere else!"
3,"The steak here is good. It's not to die for, and probably not worth the price, but its good. I enjoyed my meal here but it was really expensive. I mean it's fine dining and I expected it, but for fine dining, I also expected supurb food. It was good. Not great."
3,I got Jamerica takeout and it was REALLY messy but SO worth it. The mango run chicken was enormous and everything I could have asked for. Each element was flavorful and satisfying on their own but together they were magical. \nThe shop is decorated with photos and letters and seems like a chill place to have a quick meal.
1,"This place is not worth the money! For $17 entry fee I expected this place to be a lot bigger. It is literally the size of a standard hotel room, minus the bathroom-no joke! They do not allow you to bring your own camera in so that they can further rip you off with being forced to buy photos from them professionally. I understand some prefer professional photos but you should be given the option at least to take a few of your own pictures. Ridiculous! I know everything in Vegas is super over priced but this experience was the most disappointing for me. I would advise saving your money. Total bummer!"
3,"Tried the new \""Fit Wrap\"" and it was very healthy on their Heaven and Hell menu. It had a weird combination of stuff, but it worked. Shaved turkey, spinach, cukes, carrots, onions, tomatoes and a pesto vinagarette. I guess sweet potato fries aren't the best for you, but they were the side dish, so gotta have a few and they were crinkle cut and non-greasy. Shannon might be the best looking Kilt girl in town and is super friendly and even remembers people's names. Strange mix of tourists and Scottsdale douchebags, but all was calm at the bar"
2,Visited 3 spas over 4th of July Weekend (Bathouse and Mandarin were other 2) and this was second to Mandarin.  Exceptional lounge area.....wet area was okay....the aesthetician (did i spell that right?) was AWWWWWWWWWWWESOME!!! Even the room and the table were exquisite.  \n\nDownside...the hardsell on products after the facial was a turnoff...checkin took forever cuz front desk staff couldn't figure out how to process a SpaFinder gift card.....refreshments in the lounge area were just okay.  I think I could have given it 4 stars if it were any place else but with the reputation of Canyon Ranch....the expectations were pretty high but I still recommend them.  Plenty of attendants who are very friendly and easy to find.
1,We had friends who went this weekend to the grand opening so we decided to try it tonight. They had karaoke which was fine but when you go through their menu and all the promotions for Tuesday it says half off on appetizers and cocktails. Which is apparently not true what they meant for cocktail - when we receive the bill for our drinks-its only for beer and well drinks but nothing says it on the menu and our waitress was as useful as a pet rock. We waited at several 30 minute intervals her walking past the table at least 4 times to simply order and get our water down cocktails. During that time never mentioned that it was for well drinks.
1,"The food is a little pricey but tastes really good.  I am finding out that each employee has their own opinion of quantity of items though.  One guy gives a big portion of meat when the next day the employee will sprinkle on the meat.  The thing that I hate bout this place is that the wait time for food becomes longer and longer each time.  This past time I went on a Tuesday for Cheap tacos.  I ordered 3 tacos little did I know these tacos would be the longest wait for tacos I would never get. \n\nI order the tacos and see the guy cooking up a whole bunch of tacos.  I assume they are expecting a lot of tacos being ordered and is preparing for the rush.  As I am waiting and waiting I realize that my order is not being made.  Also the person behind me who ordered a burrito has not gotten their order as it sits over in the over.  The person at the front of the line had ordered 40 tacos.  The person after him 20 tacos.  Me being two more people after them who ordered 3 tacos is still waiting same with everyone behind me.  The geniuses were preparing all 60 tacos for these two people while 20 people are waiting in line.  I asked the counter person what happened to my 3 tacos.  He said they are coming along.  The lady behind me asked me what bout her burrito and he said they will be with her shortly.  We both walked out followed by at least 3 others.  Moral of the story.  Don't go here on a Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday you will not get service in a reasonable amount of time."
0,"This place is horrible. regulars are rude, bikers wear colors and tension is high. new owners did nothing to improve it, but  raised the prices."
1,"Over cooked $58 ribeye. Second one tasted salty and charred. Temp was good but no efforts to correct. For that much money, it's a shame. Will do my best to divert people from coming here."
0,"We went here for my husband's birthday in December with a group of our friends.  I have been to their other location at the Paris Las Vegas and the experience was always pretty good.  The server at first was really nice and promised to be accommodating and even promised that the food once we ordered would be out fast.  She even said that she would split our bills (which is unheard of when you have a large party).  The dinner looked promising.  We arrived right before 7:00pm.  We didn't get out of there until almost 10:00pm.  \n\nWe ordered our drinks, or at least attempted to.  She only asked 3/4 of the table for drinks.  Then was a smart ass and scolded our friends that she didn't ask for their drink order, rolled her eyes, gave them the \""one minute finger\"" and then came around to ask for their drinks.  50 minutes later and after asking her twice and another server for their beers they finally got them.  Our one friend was only stopping by to have a drink before he had to go to another event.  By the time the beer came, he could not drink it because he had to drive.  Meanwhile, we had also given her our appetizer order and were still waiting for those.  \n\nFinally the apps came and then slowly, but surely the entrees came.  It was about 9:15pm by the time we got all the food.  My friend's dad actually called one of the suits walking around several times to complain about the service and they graciously took off the appetizers and tried to smooth things over with gift cards.  He told them that it was my husband's birthday and they didn't acknowledge it.  I don't expect anything extra for saying it's someone's birthday except if I know it's a guest's birthday, I say \""Happy Birthday!\"" \n\nEven though I have a gift card to here, I do not think I will use it.  I do not want to go back."
0,"When I went there (Ive been multiple times) off the bat there is hardly anyroom. If you are in a wheel chair, you literaly wont be able to eat there. Which is fine for me but still uncomfortable.\nI  poured the soy sauce out, it was black and old. \nWhen soy goes bad it turns black, taste bitter and like pure salt. They had obviously never changed out the soy in their bottles. It goes bad in a day w/o refridgeration.  For me this is a sign of poor food handling. \n\nThe fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture. Actually I have got minor food poisoning there 2 times. \n\nGo to Roka Akor if you are looking for fresh creative food. AMAZING, I will never go anywhere else.\n\nThey use no hydrogenated oils or preservatives. Freshest cleanest tasting food ever.!!!!"
1,Room was fair.  Bathroom bad.  Pool excellent.  No matter where you want to go in the hotel you have to go through the casino.  What a pain.  Don't come here with kids! Will not be back!
0,"I may not ever come back-\nAll I could think of was \""It took me a damn hour to find parking\"" and \""I wanna hit someone,anyone.\"" This may be just as big of collection of douchbags as the strip on NYE. I felt sorry for all the artists down there, trying to make a living,when all the people who go there are just there to drink, people watch, and party. I didn't witness one person making a sale, and thievery MUST be incredible to fend off there.\n\nTo kick off the night, we thought we'd be able to park at the stratosphere and catch the tram,like the website says all over it. The valet was nice enough to come out and inform us otherwise.\nSo we drove down there at about 8,found parking at 9, stayed maybe an hour,wading through a bunch of drunks, and finally left after being way less than impressed. It's a damn good thing it's free, because I WOULD have hit someone after spending money just to get in that mess."
4,"One of my favorites. Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood. \n\nThe service is excellent, the menu has a nice variety (considering that it is pub fare), and it is a nice, cozy place to have dinner. \nWe especially like sitting in the booths along the wall by the bar. \n\nI can't get enough of any of their dishes involving the Guinness shredded beef... I am normally not a fan of wraps, but the shredded beef wrap is sooo good. My partner gets the Stoner Pie every time. \nAlso, they've got awesome homemade desserts. \n\nThe only caveat? As non-sports fans, we are sometimes surprised to find that they're packed on game nights. We don't hold it against them, though it is something to keep in mind if you're planning on going.\n\nWe keep coming back. Good, reliable food and service."
4,"OMG!! Had A Blast! Scarowind is soo fun (However I don't get scare, it was still awesome!! The people who work there ( trying to scare people) were soo friendly and funny! Gotta say, I had the best night of my life with my friends ( and scarowind buddies XD) ! Obviously I went at 6pm and left at 12 am means it was awesome! So I can't wait for next year Scarowind! Love love this theme park!!!"
3,"I'm not sure why everyone is being so grumpy when reviewing this buffet... I've definitely been to most every buffet in Vegas and I can honestly say that this one is pretty amazing (you may want to reserve your opinions as I did spend 4 hours here for CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH).  \n\nI had the champagne brunch with a large group.  We were sat immediately and they didn't even charge us the crap required gratuity that most places charge you when you're in a group of 6 or more.  The food isn't exactly top of the top but it was definitely still tasty... A whole island dedicated to crab legs and shrimp (you have to peel the shrimp yourself, but eh.... Still worth it) AND comfort food galore!!!  Also, if you were like me and wandered, you found that there was a whole separate area dedicated to nom nom nom desserts!!! \n\nFor $26 each, we got 4 hours worth of champagne and all the food we can eat.  Not to mention the fact that our servers were really FRIENDLY... REALLY.  I know this isn't the Wynn buffet or anything but I would say this buffet is definitely a GREAT value.\n\nTIP: Ask for Juana or Eddie to be your servers... They are PHENOMENAL."
2,"The concept of the The District seems like it'd be a great one...Street-like setting with shopping on either side of the walkway and apartments above.   The stores that attract me there are REI, Anthropologie, WS and Pottery Barn....oh wait, and Lucille's BBQ.  Other than that, nothing really else to see.  \n\nThe street/walkway is really short.  You could walk from one end to the other in less than 10 minutes.  I guess the shops are suppose to attract you in so you end up strolling down, but other than the ones listed, there's not much else.  Maybe if there was a live band in the evening , cafes or outdoor vendors or something, it'd be a better hang out spot."
0,the sushi was meh. nothing worth your time. also was a victim of my server's racial ignorance at the time of my visit. i will not be going ever again.
4,"For once I stepped into Lowe's without being forced into buying tools. Instead I stepped in here to pick up gardening materials. Lowe's has a well rounded selection of succulents. In an attempt of creating various atrium's, we went to a couple of Lowe's in search of these desert dwelling plants. A month later and the initial batch is thriving and blooming. They create great accent pieces and are the envy of all my friends."
4,"waiting is 1-2 hours, but you know what, totally worth it! Love the combo pan roast the most, very flavorful, lots of seafood, and the rice to mix with it was properly cooked. Linguine with clam was good but not outstanding. will go back to again for the pan roast even have to stand in line for another 1 hour or longer"
2,"Un peu d\u00e9cue, choix limit\u00e9 de fromage, on pourrait s'attendre \u00e0 plus. \n\nJe vais peut-\u00eatre tenter de leur donner une autre chance"
4,"First off, I would like to let all the haters know I am NOT an Arrogant Butcher employee or an employee of Fox Concepts.  That being said,  I went to AB last week and was pleasantly surprised.  I love downtown Phoenix and keep hoping it'll start getting more popular down there.  The ambience is great and love the decor.  \nBoyfriend had fish & chips which I know is hard to mess up but it was honestly the BEST fish & chips I've ever had (better than any I had in England).  I had the swordfish w/ barley.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly and I loved the tiny kick in the seasoning.  The entrees were wonderful, but the best part of the whole meal was the blueberry cheesecake!  It comes in a jar and is not ordinary cheesecake but AB's version is soooooo good.  I wanted another!\nService was amazing and food came out in a timely manner.  I don't like when restaurants make their uniforms \""unisex\"" because the poor girls always end up looking so manly.  Let the girls wear something a little more flattering!!\nI have been to several Fox places and I couldn't help but notice a lot of copy-catting from other menus.  My only wish for AB would be that they created more of their own entrees/appetizers."
4,Yum! I love Buca. I know it's nothing fancy but it's homey and delicious. I love the salad with Gorgonzola and craisins. They have great pasta and their garlic cheesy bread is not for the faint of heart. So much garlicky goodness. Can't wait to go back.
2,"Great happy hour, even on Saturday. All the drinks are either a dollar or two off and the appetizers are all half price. Plenty of places to sit, provided you get there early or if you call and make a reservation. ( Make sure to do that if you have a large group) The chicken wings I ordered were ok but the sweet potatoe fries were AWESOME! All in all a great place to watch any sport event that may be happening with a group of friends."
1,"Unfortunately our experience at this bar was pretty bad. We ordered de queso con carne appetizer and it was truly disgusting! There was literally two tablespoons of grease floating on top of the cheese. The service was really mediocre, we saw our waitress, the manager and a bus-person passing by our table, but no one was willing to refill our drinks. It literally took 20 minutes to get more soda. For my entree I got the mac and cheese and it was pretty bland. The only good part about my visit was the warm cookie appetizer which was delicious! Overall, the bar has a great atmosphere, I just wish the food an"
1,"This was the hotel I stayed at for my 21st birthday and I almost think that was the last time as well and to be honest I don't think I really notice much of a difference in their gaming, amentities, or layout. The rooms to this hotel really reminded me of a Holiday Inn or something of that caliber."
3,"Cute place. Never noticed it before the remodel and I must have drove past it 100 times. I am all about buying local so it's nice to have a local store offering local stuff. \n\nI bought some dates. Man they were good. I also had a date shake... Don't let the name fool you. It is not healthy. It's like a vanilla milkshake with maybe 1 date blended in. Although it wasn't healthy, It was delicious. \n\nMinus 1 star because they don't do a lot of sampling. I can't imagine they get a ton of customers daily, so the ones they do get, should be shown around and enticed to buy and try."
1,"Maybe it was a bad day for the postal service, I don't know. This was probably the 10th time I've ever been inside a post office in my life. Random fact about me..\n\nAnyway, the sign said they open at 8:00AM, I opened the door at 8;03 .. I'm not that OCD I just happened to get a text at the same time I walked in :)\n\nWell I waited in line for 15 minutes, not a normal line, it was a \""We hear the employees enjoying their coffee and breakfast behind the big scary shutter doors\"" line.\n\nIt was ridiculous. Myself and 5 other people stood there like sheep waiting patiently for bob and sofia to finish their breakfast and conversation to open the gate of a post office that should have been open for 15 minutes prior.\n\nAnnoying."
2,Watched UFC 148 here. We walked in and ordered a few drinks and watched the fight for less than $20 (spent on drinks). Super cool and chill place. It was nice to escape the Vegas heat and just watch a fight without having to pay an arm. \n\nMost places were charging a minimum of $25 per person or minimum of $100 per person for better seats.\n\n+ cool ambiance\n+ lots of TVs\n+ good food (from what I saw)\n+ Note to self: next time order the NACHOS (HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE for $14)\n+ Maia won!!! Made some money.\n\n\n\n- Lost money on Sonnen. dang it. DID YOU SEE THE FIGHT!!!!!!!! ughhhh
0,"We came here for lunch last week.  We had a coupon we had purchased online and thought we'd try this place.  The visit started off badly when we arrived at the place and there was a handwritten sign saying that \""All Groupons must have reservations\"", with a phone number listed.  So, we stood outside in the 100 degree Las Vegas heat and called for a reservation.  We were asked when we wanted to eat and my wife told them, we are standing outside and are here for lunch.  They told her the manager wasn't there and could we call a different phone number and talk to the manager?  So, we did.  Again, my wife asked if we could make a \""reservation\"" and told the person on the phone that we were here for lunch.  He said is would be over in about 15 minutes.  Say what?  Not sure what his presence at the restaurant had to do with us eating lunch.  My wife asked, \""Can we go inside and order\"".  Yes, you may.  Sheesh! \n\nSo, in we went.  A nice lady promptly seated us as we were the only customers there as lunch time (a bad sign?).  We ordered a la carte sushi from the \""Groupon Menu\"", huh?! We were quickly given water to drink.  About 10 minutes after we ordered, a young man showed up at our table with headphones on.  The manager perhaps?  Not sure, he didn't introduce himself, but he wanted to know about our coupon.  He took the coupon.\n\nSo, after all of that, the sushi came out.  It seemed decent actually, but who wants to go through all of that to order a few sushi rolls?  This place will likely close within a couple of months due to bad reputation and no business.\n\nI feel bad for the waitress as she seemed nice and polite.\n\nI definitely would not come back."
1,"Very old place and you can't even get a drink at a decent price, we paid $8 a Stella Artois...On Tap! BS! Don't bother going."
3,"Very thorough and pleasant staff.  Dr Callie Maursetter was wonderful!  Knowledgeable, professional and friendly.   I would give this 5 stars except for 1 thing.  First, whatever that contraption is to measure my eye pressure is awful. There is no puff of air but to say you are going to \""tickle my eye\"" is the understatement of the year.  Instead of scarring the crap out of me with air this little contraption sticks something in it, it is as terrifying and equally uncomfortable as the dang puff test. If it wasn't for this incident I would have had a 5 star visit."
3,"Great view of the water show. The service is good, though there have been times when the place was very busy but the waiters are all very diligent and nice once you can snag one. The food is delicious. The steamed tiger shrimp (not sure if it is on the menu but can be ordered) is great. The crab is good- great seasoning. The hot and sour soup tends to be more hot than sour at times. Expensive but great meal and view."
0,"lack of identity, the Asian noodles don't look nor taste like it, the pastas are the same. Taste like cooked by bunch of students, taste very plain. just like cooking from school."
3,"I love the convenience of this place! I love that I can go in, stop by the deli, fill out the form for what kind of sandwich I want for lunch, go to the prepackaged food area, grab a couple things for dinner, scout out a couple new items around the store, and swing back by the deli with my sandwich wrapped with my name on it waiting for me on my way to the check out. \nThey also make it easy to choose healthy options, and I like grabbing the healthy snack of carrots, cucumbers and celery w/ dressing prepackaged by the deli instead of chips as a side for my sandwich. \n\nOver all, they are clean, the food is good, and the place is efficient! Lucky for me, they are down the street from my office so I can go there often!"
0,"Can u do a quarter star? What were they going for with this place? If they were going for over-priced ,poorly thought out selections on a pseudo fashionable menu with small portions ; crappily prepared they hit the nail on the head. And the service was mediocre"
4,"Love this place. Best BBQ in Vegas. What's even better is that the food and service are consistently great. Our favorites: ribs, brisket, the king, burnt ends, cream corn, sticky Vegas style chicken wings and the best BBQ nachos you've ever imagined. If you haven't tried Memphis yet, run don't walk."
3,"Called on Tuesday for a special occasion on Friday. Briefly explained to reservation-taker that I was surprising my husband for lunch on his 50th birthday and would like a table with an excellent view. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by name (?) even though we'd never been there before, and since we were a few minutes early were asked to wait. Other couples came in, each celebrating something: birthdays and engagements. I was concerned that my husband's birthday would be just another ho hum event and that we'd be left in the dust. But no.\n\nService was stellar. Lunch menu was varied and food was tasty. Portion sizes were perfect: not the usual Vegas-strip-enormous sized plates but servings we could actually finish. \n\nWe ordered two desserts to share which I completely recommend: creme brulee and apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream, (both ridiculously delish) and afterwards, the waiter brought out a lovely chocolate mousse on a white plate which had written in chocolate \""Happy Birthday.\""  Couldn't have asked for a lovelier lunch in all of Las Vegas.\n\nOne thing you need to know if you're going at lunch time is that the Bellaggio Fountains don't start until 3 pm on weekdays so you won't see that. Totally not the restaurant's fault! But you might want to know so you can reserve at dinnertime if you'd prefer."
0,"For the record, I don't like anything about this place - the food is bad & overpriced. The beers are terribly overpriced. The service is awful & the building is a gross, dirty old house. But in addition to all of that, I have the following complaint:\n\nMy brother was there last night & they didn't give him back his debit card. He discovered it was missing at 8pm. He called Sharp Edge at 8pm & then called them again at 10:30 pm, before getting on his Greyhound bus to head home. They told him that they looked & that they did NOT have it. Then he gets a call from Becky at 1am telling him that OOPS, they do have his card! But now he's not in Pittsburgh anymore. So Becky tells him to tell ME to come & get it the next day, that they would have it at the bar. So the next day, I leave work early, drive 30 minutes OUT OF MY WAY to pick up his card. I get there & some dude with a black beard tells me I can't have the card, it's the law. Only my brother can pick it up. I don't think that's true but even if it is, then why was I told to come & get it? No apology for wasting my time either. I was told that they can cut it up for me & throw it away. Great, thanks! And now my brother has no access to his money for 7-10 days while he waits for a new card. \n\nNothing but complete incompetence all around from these people."
3,"In the context of this review understand that the expectations for a stay in ANY five-star Hotel are very rigid & though our overall experience quite pleasant, we were a bit disappointed by our recent stay despite getting an amazing rate.  Our first room hit the mark for luxury in vegas - Absolutely baller - but the second had a different lay-out, was in a \""forgotton corridor of the hotel\"" & there were oversights in the housekeeping (trash under under one of the chairs) & the room smelled a bit like cleaning solution when we walked in though looked a little less manicured than the previous & some of the amenities didn't work like they had in the first room we grabbed (the night prior).  \n\nOverall it was a pretty manageable from an admin point of view (checking-in / Free Self-park / helpful bell-desk) and far less cumbersome than other casino / resorts we've stayed at.  The natural light in the property & the tall vaulted ceilings makes for a less \""Vegas-ey\"" type of experience in a really good way.  The dining options overall were okay -  The Tapas place is extraordinary & the POOL is also one of the best amenities.  Avoid the 20 min trek from the room & 30 min line at the Starbucks on the promenade level by ordering a carafe of coffee to your room!"
4,"She's dressed in black and yellow, she says \""Hello,\ncome sit next to me you fine fellow.\""\nYou run over there without a second to lose\nAnd what comes next, Steelers bust a move!!!"
2,"We eat here when we want to splurge a bit.  Upscale gourmet Italian in the mid-price range ($30ish an entree)\n\nThe canolis are great!!!\n\nIf you are looking for a little less spendy place on a week night, check out Nora's on the West side."
2,"A great pitstop to crash before heading out to where the real party is at aka Xs or Surrender, Tryst isn't exactly known for being the first choice of partygoers. However, one of my friends knew a promoter who hooked it up for our group of girls and we were able to get free admission to both Tryst and Xs and two free drink tickets for each girl. \n\nHonestly, we weren't here for very long and we just came here to fill up on drinks. The inside was very reminiscent of Xs in terms of interior decor to the point where it resembled the inside seating area and dance floor of Xs, minus the huge outside pool area.  While the dance floor is pretty small, it does overlook a gorgeous waterfall.\n\nThe drink tickets allowed us well drinks of our choice and I decided to go with two Screwdrivers. One thing I have to give props to the bartenders is that they really don't skimp on the alcohol. The ratio of alcohol to juice was nearly half, so this got us tipsy quite quickly. \n\nWe headed to the dance floor for a little bit and the energy of the crowd was sort of lively. There wasn't a really large crowd and most of the people seemed a little older. An option for those who aren't really into places where you end up packed like sardines, this seems like an acceptable alternative. \n\nHowever, compared to Xs, this place is really more like a lounge and I'm not sure why people would want to drop big bucks on getting a table here, unless all you want to do is chill and relax or drop less bucks. If you're with a group of girls looking to make the most of your Vegas trip, try to find a deal like the one I'm talking about here. Pre-gaming will be a little more fun."
1,"Only go to this location during the snowbird off-season.  Otherwise, you'll be playing bumper cars in the parking lot, standing in the pharmacy line that goes around the building twice and waiting twenty minutes in the check out line for the senior in front of you to write a personal check for milk, eggs and Dulcolax."
3,3.5 stars\n\nThey have a huge selection of bottled beer and around 15 beer on draft. It's a very low key spot where you can come with some friends and just hang out and enjoy some beer. Tried the orange blossom (very fruity) and chocolate stout which was really good.
0,"A very disappointing experience ... We just had breakfast at sugar factory and one of us ordered the eggs Benedict and found a long piece of plastic on the ham . We called our waiter who took the plate and didn't even apologize and asked if We'd like another dish without saying please accept our apology your dish is on the house .. This gets worse when the waiter talks to the manager who doesn't have the decency to come by to the table and apologize . We asked for check and left the restaurant but before leaving we talked to the manager who 1st didn't apologize , 2nd : he denied that the Waiter talked to him about our table and said \"" this wasn't the case even though we saw him talking to our waiter and that the Benedict was taken off the bill 3rd he doesn't deserve to be a manager in such an industry as he has no sense of hospitality , problem ownership and guest recovery.\nThe attitude we got from him has definitely made us not wanting to step in that restaurant again .."
3,"We came here the other night to just grab a round of drinks before we headed to dinner at a different place - but after 1 hour, 1 pitcher of sangria, and 4 mojitos - we were hooked. Not sure if it was the drinks or the addicting chips and salsa they kept feeding us. Either way - we ended up spending close to another 2 hours drinking and eating. For dinner I would recommend the chicken and shrimp fajita. It's delicious and serves enough food for two! \n\nOh and love the atmosphere....and the music!"
2,"I have been to 3 brasseurs before in other locations and when I saw this one in Laval I decided to stop by for a beer and something to eat. The first time I went to do his location I had friends with me and we've ordered something with sausage, corn and ham. \n\nThe food wasn't great but was decent and the service wasn't too bad. It was a weekday and the place was somewhat empty so everything was done quite fast. So I had friends over from another province and I took my chance and decided to stop by again. The second time we had chicken wing (very small quantity, not at all what we expected, quite greasy and bony), and I had the impression that the beer was watery. \n\nThis time the service was horrible. The guy who served as was quite rude, he never came by to ask if we needed something else and when he did was in a very pushy way. It was a Saturday night and to my surprise the place was empty again. The kitchen closed and he didn't even ask if we wanted to order something before they were done (mind you, in think this was around 1 am, which is quite early for a weekend night). \n\nWhen  paying our bill, my friend said something about being tipsy and not being able to calculated how much each one would have to pay and the server just said \""yeah yeah yeah...\"" in a very rude manner. Note that none of us was actually drunk or behaving inappropriately. They've tried to be friendly to the server and all we got back was a rude treatment. Even though we left a 15% tip each and he just took the money and left, not even saying thank you or wished us goodnight."
1,"My opinion : Avoid at all costs. The food was pretty bad, and we tried their pizza and asian nachos. It was pretty gross, no need to elaborate. When in Vegas and surrounded with many options, this should not be one of them."
1,"The waitress at the Salty Se\u00f1orita recommended this places to us because it was right down the street. It seemed fun until I overpaid for an okay hot fudge sundae. It was delicious but not worth the money. Next time, I'll make myself one at home."
0,"The service was good but their food wasn't. I had the duck dish and it tasted really rubbery and dry. \nMy husband had the seafood combo and it also tasted rubbery. We both ended up feeling sick the next day.\n\nDon't eat here, unless you want to get sick."
1,"This is apparently a pop-up establishment (in conjunction with 56 North) so may not be here that long & probably explains why no great effort has been made to fully strip out the fittings from the previous incarnation of the premises (Native State). Hence one of the sinks in the gents has a crack in the bowl & a couple of too small pictures adorn one of the rear walls in an attempt to imbue the place with a new character.\nNo complaints about the burgers we had (the Irish & the Independence) in terms of taste, size or price & the accompanying salads were good. The fries could have been a bit warmer but the (possibly) home made ketchup was nice & tangy. Service wasn't bad although it tailed off (no inquiry if a second beer was desired when a glass was cleared away for example) & so we didn't tip.\nThe worst thing about the place is the beer prices. Whilst making an effort to stock the quality products of Stewarts & Williams Bros. charging upwards of \u00a33.75 for most of them (both pints & bottles) along with the I&G range (readily available in supermarkets for more reasonable figures) is a backwards step. That said you probably wouldn't come in here just for a pint and with the Festival upon us they may well make a killing out of the tourist trade. As someone who lives here all year round though I'll not be back, even if they have anymore discount deals on which is what took me there in the first place."
3,"Delicious garlic cheese bread and toasted cheese raviolis!  Italian sodas with a souvenier glass may sound silly but I bought in because the contents were so good.  This is not pasta just thrown together in a plate for kids to be occupied and get basic nutrition.  This place is really good.  I actually think that for a spaghetti chain, they make a difference by taking extra care to present the dishes in a pleasant way and by selecting quality contents.  I am a fan of the themed space.  I sat in a trolley car and felt like a kid.\nTo tell you what to specifically order is hard.  I had the option to make my own dish so, I can say that my meaty sauce selection was married with a penne and garlic.  You wanna talk about something good! \nRight now...this is my fave spaghetti house."

1,"The Mirage used to have one of the best casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.  They offered great games and plenty of tables.  Now, however, they offer mostly sucker bets that cater to dumb tourists.\nMost depressing is how most of the blackjack at Mirage is no longer full pay, 3:2.  Instead Mirage is now peddling sucker blackjack that only pays 6:5.  If you bet $10 and get a blackjack, you're supposed to get paid $15 (3 to 2), not $12 (6 to 5)!  By reducing the payout at their blackjack tables, the house advantages goes up by over $300%! \nMGM properties used to offer high quality rooms and a great gamble.   Now they're turning into tourist traps full of sucker bets.  The casinos now cater to dumb tourist who don't understand what they're playing.\nStay away from 6:5 blackjack!!  It's for losers."
1,"My famous last words before dinner were: how can you screw up fried food? Well, Pete's found a way! The general consensus was that Pete's takes delivery of their rectangular fish patties from the same general supplier McDonald's must use. Not that this is the most terrible thing in the world - I myself am a lover of the occasional Filet-O-Fish, but I guess when a place's claim to fame is \""fish and chips\"" you kind of expect REAL battered fish and chips, malt vinegar, or at least some fried clams, hush puppies, or real zucchini spears. Alas, none of the above. Joseph Malin would have turned over in his grave. Even my eight year old daughter was left wondering what kind of fish produces rectangular filets and what kind of shrimp comes shaped like a flat plank. I found the experience likened to that of volunteering to chaperone a children's carnival: glad I tried it once, I might even get guilted into doing it twice after the selective amnesia kicks in, but I'll never do it on purpose again. In my experience \""cash only\"" places are generally worth making the extra stop at an ATM for; meh, Pete's - not so much."
0,"Horrible.  Rudest doormen and security guards. Not verbally, but as in they will grab you, push you, knock you out of the way whenever they see fit.  I got seperated from my group and after being pushed down a lined of 5 security guards creating a human wall I was on the other side of the club and because it is such a fire hazard and over packed, it took my 45 minutes to even find them again.  Nightmare."
0,"Would not recommend this particular Applebees to anyone. Me and my family ordered food. My cousin and I ordered pasta and it was supposed to come with bread. They forgot that. Finished our pasta and still no bread. Also our appetizers were chips and salsa along with some spinach dip. They brought out a small plate knowing there were six of us. How were we going to eat the chips and dip? Pour the dip in our hands and dip the chip into our palm? My cousins wife's drink was done sort of Sangria with cranberry in it. She took one sip and realized how disgusting it was. The floor manager nor two orlther waitresses noticed we were missing more plates, bread for the pasta and that the big sangria drink was still full. This was a slow Sunday night by the way. It was barely even busy. I would not recommend this place. Perhaps Chilis or another similar type restaurant or different Applebees would be your best bet."
1,"Normally I am hardly ever sick. Since I've begun working in the public and being around 200 or more people daily that seems to have drastically changed.\n\nI am no MD, but I know enough and I know what I can take/need for my symptoms. When you go in for Tonsillitis and the doctors want to give you OTC Zyrtec (which they will swear up and down is covered by your insurance, ITS NOT!!)  you know something is just not right. This happened to me. I hate the fact that I have to get a little abrasive with the doctors here to get them to understand that not everyone in Vegas has allergies. Furthermore my tonsils are clearly swollen and there is a white coating on them, PLUS a fever and I have the chills... THAT IS NOT ALLERGIES! \n\nThe doctor finally rxd me some Amox and a throat coat, but me having to play good cop bad cop with someone I'm paying is just BS. Really the only reason I go here is because it's close to my apartment somewhat, and they're opened on the weekends at 8am. My son and I both needed to be seen and we got there at 745am, Signed in at 803am (they opened late) and weren't seen until 9am!! We were 3rd on the list! RIDICULOUS!  Prior to this visit I went in for an upper respiratory infection which again they attributed to allergies... and again tried to \""prescribe\"" Zyrtec to me.  \n\nMeh, no yay for you!"
2,"This exhibit had some cool things in it. Like the big piece of ship. Seeing some of the belongings was cool, but some of the stuff was creepy....like the big piece of the ship.  Other than that, I think it was well done and enjoyable.  It was a good waste of an hour, and was pretty awesome. I don't feel a need to do it again though."
2,"We've taken our pup here to get shots and heart worm meds. Cost us around $170 (meds included), but I suppose that's alright... I was hoping to get him into their doggy day care program, but the hours are not convenient to anyone who works before 7am.  Will go back."
4,"The Sugar Factory is really good.  I was initially hesitant because I thought it was going to be a ton of sugary food, but it is actually a great restaurant with delicious food.  The people with me had Cheeseburgers which tasted amazing and I had the French Dip Sandwich, also which was really good.  It is beautiful at night because you can see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. \n\nThey have these amazing, and giant drinks which are colorful and sugary and full of alcohol.  I didn't try one, but if they taste as good as they look, I would say that it is a must do while in Vegas.  I also love the dark atmosphere of the restaurant. \n\nIt is attached to the actual candy store which was fun to look through afterwards, they have a lot of hard to find candy and vintage stuff.  Pretty cool place.  I wouldn't write it off if you aren't into sugar, as I am not, but it was still worth going to.  I will definitely be going back at some point."
4,I love it! I have been to.Thailand and this is authentic.  I had their mussaman curry and it was done the way it should be. I love spicy food sonI got Thai medium and it was extremely spicy and flavorful. I feel very lucky that this authentic Thai restaurant is close to our house.
4,"Was my first time getting a brazillian and was using a groupon! She was very professional nice and quick. For a first experience it went fine. It hurt but nothing extreme, mind you I have never gotten anything waxed before professionally. I was in and out and it was over. She uses a combination of wax you can pull w/o strips and with strips. Definitely recommend and will personally see her again!"
1,"The decor is absolutely gorgeous - the space is huge and very well-decorated. It would be a great place to have an event or party....except for the food. \n\nThe appetizers were good. I had a polenta with sausage, onions, and fried egg. It was a great combination, if mushy.  For dinner I had what was allegedly bucatini amatriciana.  I love Italian food, and I know that bucatini amatriciana should be made with, for starters, bucatini.  This was made with spaghetti.  If there was guanciale or pancetta in it, I couldn't find it.  Lesley's mafalda with vodka sauce tasted, as she put it, exactly like a Lean Cuisine.   I agree with another reviewer who said that this restaurant is *way* overpriced for the quality of the food I just described. \n\nAs for the positives, the wine list is pretty extensive and there are a good number of reasonably priced options. The service was good, if overly attentive (which is better than underly, if that's a word, attentive).  \n\nThis is a new restaurant and I believe it takes time to iron out kinks, but t seems that much more attention has been put into how this place looks than how the food actually tastes."
0,Horrible. Fucking. Experience. No level of deliciousness would justify how rude these guys were.
0,local businesses like this are the scourge of Tempe. No concept of anything resembling service. Dirty. Inedible cardboard food. On it's way out.
4,"US Airways has been my domestic airline of choice. I experience the best connections and convenience in the variety in connections, period. I think in reading all of the reviews regarding delays....I hardly believe that there exists an airline that experiences better timing. Maybe I haven't noticed. But what I do notice is the hospitality factor. Flying isn't what it used to be prior to 9/11 but I DO appreciate US Airways and the positive service that I receive. They make a difference to me and my weekly schedule.Comparatively I feel they succeed other domestic choices."
2,"Beautiful, but drinks were expensive and weak, and the speaker system couldn't handle the beats of Alesso, the main DJ attraction - pole dancers were incredible, though -"
2,"After living in Flagstaff for 7 years, I guess I became somewhat of a snob of trails.  But it's kinda close to my house and the view is decent. Too many people for my style usually.  But I did do some trail maintenance on SM with VOAZ which was pretty cool.  See pic."
3,"Another jury duty lunch escapade! There was about 10 of us and it took about 20 min for that big of a group to be seated which was great for the busy downtown Phoenix rush. \n\nI believe everyone got lunch this time around and some highlights include great black tea, huge wraps (highly recommended ) and super quick service! \n\nWe were able to spilt the check as well which was another plus. \n\nGreat environment. Usually would recommend the outside seating but it was extremely windy so it was closed during lunch."
4,"Cafe Matina is a wonderful place to just come by and chill or study or meet a friend.  Great pool tables in the back, and the food here is consistently tasty and fresh.\nMatina herself is also a gracious hostess.\n\nSpacious and airy, the huge windows affords ample opportunity for serious people watching given that it is in the heart of the Mile End.\n\nStressed from writing your paper? Need a break? Then come here for a breather, grab a latte and take a well-deserved break. It's the perfect place for it."
4,"Unbelievable. Start to finish. I love steakhouses but this was amazing. The service was impeccable (Amy was our server), Lauren was the manager and everyone else was just fabulous. We had the porterhouse. Sooooo good. The ravioli special to start. And as an aside, the DJ was fabulous!!  Can't wait to go back."
3,"My partner was in the mood for Chinese food last night, so I was a little skeptical as I considered the options:  fast food Chinese takeout?  No.  A Chinese buffet?  No.  Chain restaurant PF Chang's?  No.  An 1980s-decorated Chinese sit-down restaurant?  Definitely, no.   That's when he remembered seeing a new place being built in Matthews.  We drove by Ming Fu to see if it was open yet.  We had been at this establishment before just a couple of years ago when it was a burger place.  It was very nicely decorated inside before, but walking into Ming Fu now, you wouldn't even recognize it from before.  They've totally redone the inside and gave it a very modern, calming Zen-like feel.  It was beautifully, yet simply, decorated, and I was already immediately impressed upon walking in the doorway.  \n\nThe menu options were very diverse without being overwhelming like at some Chinese restaurants.  There were decent typical Chinese $10ish meals or, if you wanted to get something a little more high-end, there were $15ish meals.  We opted for the first, along with a couple of cups of soup.  \n\nOur server brought out complimentary fried Chinese noodles with a spicy mustard and sweet and sour dipping sauce, and all of these were tasty.  The hot and sour soup was good, but not as flavorful, peppery, or spicy as some I've had.  The Sa Cha Chicken entree (broccoli, water chestnuts, snap peas, brown sauce) was very good, too, with a \""just right\""-sized portion served on modern dinnerware.  Although denoted as spicy, it too wasn't anywhere what I'd call spicy.  I like some heat!  Some sriracha or hot chile sauce/paste on the table would have been a much welcome addition.  I had to resort to adding heat by using the Chinese mustard.  \n\nThe service was great and friendly, and we're definitely going back.  The atmosphere alone is awesome, and then you get the bonus of a very reasonably priced, good Chinese meal."
3,"Great little place with a little bit of everything.  Went at the suggestion of friends for some weekend BBQ and all I can say is WOW!  Great BBQ chicken and the mac and cheese was heavenly.  Broke the diet but it was so worth it!  Oh, and they have Thrifty Ice Cream, too.  'Nuf said!"
2,"My wife and I came here for lunch. We wanted to try the Korean BBQ. The place was being renovated. There were 2 servers and the place was not that busy. We ordered the Combo 4 BBQ. The Galbi was not marinated well. The pork belly was bland as it was not marinated at all. The spicy pork was good. They give you free sides and the Kim Chi was just so so. The service  was slow and inattentive. They had a 15% off yelp check in that they did not honor since they are changing the name of the restaurant but it is the same owner.  The waitress stated that it is more of a \""modern Asian\"" cuisine, whatever that means. \n\nI would rather go to Takamatsu for KBBQ."
3,"I went to Pure Barre for the first time about one month ago...It was a bit intimidating at first.  It isn't easy the first time, especially for a beginner like myself.  I was so sore after that first class, I mean almost couldn't walk sore.  But, I went again, and again..each time I go to a class i get a great work out, and feel great afterwards.  I think it is worth trying, and checking out!"
3,"The place has upgraded over the years...prices of their rooms have gone up extremely but there are tons of eating places to go to here as well as shopping. I usually wait for deals to stay here. It's in the center of the Vegas strip and walking distance to all other hotels and restaurants is a plus. It's upscale and classy. I love the forum shops as they have some of my favorite stores. Bathrooms are kept clean, the slot machines are my thing but my hubby goes for poker tables. He says they all start high usually. There is always entertainment outside especially by the bar and entrances. Everyone should come here..."
3,"I only come here for midnight steak and eggs. You can't beat steak, eggs, hash brown and buttered toast all for $3.95! It's not the greatest but when I have the late night munchies and for that price, I can't really complain. \n\nSome days the steak will be huge, while other days it's just eh. Also I think well done = dried the fuck out, medium well = well done, and so on.. So if you like your steak medium like me, go for medium rare. But it's really just a hit or miss with this place. Eggs and hash brown are alright and that buttered toast is only good when it's warm. \n\nOverall, the food isn't entirely horrible but like I said it's a hit or miss!"
0,"We have had probably the worst experience ever at any restaurant... The \""manager\"" Claudia is a horrible person who is rude, and should not have a job any place that she has to deal with people. \nTook close to 30 minutes from the time we got into the store till we got the food. She was rude to both my wife, and to other customers, then I hear her on the phone to probably her boss saying that some customrs are probably going to be calling to complain but they are all idiots. Horrible and I hope wendy's takes care of this problem. We will never ever eat at another Wendy's"
1,"I arrived hopeful - left disappointed.  Woe is me!\n\nI heard very mixed things about this place - that it was past it's glory days, that the very particular Japanese dishes such as Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki were a disappointment, that it was not authentic Japanese, etc.  Which is a shame because my MO was to locate a restaurant that has great Okonomiyaki.  After the enormous shame that was Doh! Tapas and Sushi (again, another restaurant that has no business serving Izakaya style food), I was SO hopeful.\n\nFirst off: Not Japanese run.  This restaurant is Izakaya style and when I asked the server if this was a Izakaya, looked utterly confused.  Okay, then.  Plays Japanese music, serves Japanese food, Japanese notes on wall - not Japanese.  \n\nLousy service.  One poor, friendly waitress running around for seven tables.  SEVEN tables.  My water sat empty after my initial gulp and my hot tea sat in a similar fate.  (And they only have sweet iced tea?  Who does that?)\n\nThe server attempted to sit me next to a giant family table with a screaming baby.  Meanwhile, about twenty other tables sat empty.  Uh, what?  WHY would you do that?  \n\nI ordered Takoyaki, Gyoza, and of course, Okonomiyaki.\n\nTakoyaki - Best thing I had.  Perfectly executed.  \nGyoza - swimming with grease.  Tasted like it came from the Chinese hands of someone at Orchid Garden, oily and flavorless.  I wanted to gag after eating that until..\nOkonomiyaki - SO DAMN GREASY and BURNT and what IS this?  Is it that hard to make?  Do I have to open up my own Okonomiyaki restaurant?  For shame!  There was a booth, a BOOTH at last year's Aki Matsuri that served up only Okonomiyaki and it was so simple and delicious and perfect.  \n\nThe only saving grace this place has is that it's cheap.  \n\nAlso - .50 cent charge for credit cards.  Get out.  So disappointed.  You know when the local restaurants in the plaza don't even recommend to eat at an establishment that there's a problem.  From service to food, I cannot and will not return."
0,"No no no.  No beer, no service, no fun.  If you want a quiet corner to read a book or take a nap in Vegas, come to this place.  They need to remove the \""brewery\"" from the name or start brewing some beers.  Or better yet, start over and put something new in this space."
2,"Stayed here 3 nights. What people say good/bad seems accurate. Depends on your taste and budget. Some would find it gross, others would find it enchanting. It's more enchanting than gross. It is an old hotel. It's not decrepit. My room was clean and nice. Maid service was very good. The staff was polite and attentive and gave some good advice on eating nearby that checked out. Many eateries close by. The rooms are small by todays standards. I was a single, a double might feel pinched if in it much of the day. Bathrooms are old fashioned and simple, but OK. No granite counters, in fact, no counters, which, when you don't have one, you realize is pretty important. A/C was good, but you don't control it except to open/close the vent. That worked OK for me to my pleasant surprise. The room was cool on a 110 day. My biggest complaint was the WiFi. Yes, wireless, but it is \""turtle-slow\"" ... dial up slow. Pages were slow to load. If you plan to work online, this wouldn't be the place for you. Otherwise, Internet access worked, but 1 star for that. The restaurant downstairs was very good. Modern. Pleasant. Vietnamese menu. I enjoyed 3 meals there. Fresh and well presented. Ahi tuna salad was very good. Healthy food for travelers. Yes, overall, the place is a little tired, but the room was AOK. It's a little adventuresome, which will fit some well. Kind of a 40's-50's feel. Nothing gross or dangerous or dirty. Convenient location downtown and clean. If you want a decent place  to stay downtown in PHX it meets a traveler's needs. I'd recommend it. I'll come back. The neighborhood is OK for downtown. Not in a ghetto where you're afraid to venture out the door without a cop. Nothing like that. Go for it. You'll remember it more than the Embassy Suites or Holiday Inns."
0,This is a beautiful restaurant unfortunately the sushi tastes like it came from a grocery store. My roll included what was supposed to be crab on the top. It was crab like but was definitely not crab.
4,"Hands down one of the best buffets in Vegas!\n\nIt's a little ways off the strip but so worth it!  We did the seafood buffet on Friday night, got there a little later than the usual dinner crowd (about 8pm) and only had about a ten minute wait (at the most) before we were seated.\n\nEverything we tried was delicious.  The steamed crab legs, the cold crab legs, the prime rib, oxtail soup, lomi lomi salmon.  It was ALL so good!\n\nWe don't drink alcohol but apparently beer & wine are included in the price. \n\nI am also not a big dessert person but they had one of the best dessert bars ever!  At 33.99 it is a great value.  I can't wait to go back!"
4,This review is solely based on their market section. This place has a legitimate halal butcher shop section. This is hard to come by in this city. The meats are tasty if you want better ground beef let them grind you a piece of meat. They are friendly and work hard.I am so happy I found them. I wish they had better selection of rice and the produce section was better marked. Overall pretty good
0,Horrible service. They messed up on my food and refuse to fix it. In addition to that non of them speak English well enough to resolve issues instead they just want to argue with you. I told the lady who took my order 5 times to make sure my chicken is well done. The chicken was not well done and I checked it in front if the delivery boy. Who does not speak a word of English.\nI will never waste my lunch time on these idiots again.
2,"**sigh** I have a love hate relationship with Crack-in-the-box.  Oddly enough, I love their eggrolls and sourdough hamburger but try to not eat anything else! Unfortunately, they just added mini funnel cakes to the menu.  I had to try them.  Happy to report they won't be a new addiction.  \n\nMight see ya there."
3,"This place surprised me, the food is pretty great.  I ordered takeout, and arrived to find a huge line early on a Saturday afternoon.  Once I got the food home I learned why.  This is the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix for sure.  Everything seemed quite fresh, and was closer to the type of Chinese food I am used to (coming from the Northeast).  Not bad at all."
3,"I love their ice cream! The cookie monster is addictive, but mix it with the oatmeal cookie and I have a mouthful of sin and delicious. I have not had a bad ice cream and we have tasted most of the flavors. I wish the German chocolate had more stuff in it-nuts, coconut & caramel. The chocolate flavor of the ice cream is decadent as is their salted caramel. If you have not been here, you must try their ice cream. Cold Stone has nothing on this place!"
0,Really bad service. no longer offering brunch. not sure why i would ever come here again. really disappointed.you have been warned. They could have at least offered us a discount considering such a poor experience but not so much.
4,It's been about 2 months since my Vegas trip and I still miss it =[  My girlfriends and I were walking past Caesar's Palace and we noticed a bunch a people standing around. I looked up and realized it was the location of the fountain show. We waited for a couple of minutes and then it began. It was beautiful and romantic. Made me miss my boyfriend back home. Definitely something to see when in Vegas and of course it's free!
4,Best hotel to stay at!
0,DO NOT buy gas here. They will take your cash and refuse to pump gas. Filing a police report now.
2,"I've never had not so great food here. But, the food isn't the most amazing food I've ever had either. But, it's a great fall back place to go to when I don't know where else I want to eat. Or, it's a great place to meet friends. Prices are pretty decent, and service has always been good to me. \n\nI'd have to say, that the calamari is by far my favorite thing o order. I just love the white sauce that comes with it. The breading on the calamari is always so nice and light, and always crispy. \n\nSecondly, I would highly suggest the Chicken Madeira. Plus, it's such a huge portion, theres usually some left overs !!"
4,"Always correct and efficient. Also, I think this one tastes better than others. Hah. The employees are pleasant, which is basically a bonus when it comes to fast food.\n\nI'm in a love/hate with the location -- hate it because it's just far enough to be annoying but love it because if it was closer I'd probably eat it way too much.\n\nTheir Ocean Water tastes really, really good.  I know - odd, but awesome."
0,"DON\""T order anything from this company!!  I ordered 8 bottles of oil.  I made a point to call to talk to a rep and didn't just go thru the web.  It was a deal because the cost was slightly less than locally and the shipping and handling cost made the difference.  To my chagrin the package arrived with just one bottle - no explanation.  Shipping and handling same cost as if 8 bottles were delivered.  When I called they found out they only had one bottle and that is all they were going to send me - but they weren't going to lower the shipping and handling.  Tried talking to supervisor - wouldn't budge. This ended costing me more for this bottle than I would have paid locally.  Deceptive practices - not customer focused.  SHADY BUSINESS"
3,"Pretty good pizza! We ordered a large pepperoni and a side of fries. The fries were decent steak fries, but def. not worth the price of 4 bucks. The pizza had a thin good tasting crispier crust, and the sauce and cheese werent too bad either.  From a Vegas pizza perspective, it was good and tasty, better  than most of the subpar pizza I've had from most places around here. \n\nOnly downfall I'd say was the very limited menu.  I would love to see a few  Italian dishes added to the menu for some variety. \n\n Will be going back for sure!"
0,"Wow!  The Le Village Buffet at the Paris Hotel and Casino is really bad.  There was a huge selection of foods, but the quality and appearance just made the whole experience not worth it.  \n     \n     Duck L'orange=dry and overly sweet\n     Standing rib roast=very dry no taste\n     Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms=only used cheap button mushrooms, no taste,      over cooked\n     Sushi=why sushi?  Mushy rice, frozen fish.  Why sushi for a French themed buffet?\n     Brussel sprouts=over boiled, mushy, no taste\n\nThis is coming from someone who didn't have to wait in long lines, and who didn't pay the full price, as my smart, lovely wife purchased a groupon deal.  The deal also included a bottle of wine-more like grape juice.  There was no bright spot for the food.  The entire menu, and recipes need to be redone-soon!\n\nAs previous reviewers noted, service was slow.  I will give credit though, our server was really trying hard.  She brought out drinks as fast as her feet would allow, and she was very pleasant, polite, and professional considering the circumstances she works under.  The gentleman who seems to be the front of the house manager needs to get his act together.  Instead of scolding and criticizing your staff maybe you should help clear tables, or service your customers.\n\n\nLe Village Buffet in the Paris Hotel and Casino should be avoided until there is a total revamp of; management, menu, recipes, and service."
2,"This Starbucks (located at Power & Broadway in east Mesa) just opened a few months ago. It is located a block from Banner Baywood and Banner Heart hospitals, so they get extremely busy between 0600 and 0730am with hospital employees running in, or using the drive-through, to get their morning dose of caffeine. \n\nStaff members have been great during each of my visits and the inside has the usual ambiance of a Starbucks."
1,"Just got home with my drink. It felt lighter than usual, so I opened the cup and my drink was only filled up halfway. Seriously? You charge all that money for a drink and can't fill it up?"
2,#meh. There are three 'crimes' and you get selected to 'investigate' one of them. The one we did (number 3) had evidence missing from scene of crime and what appeared to be 'evidence' which was not detailed in the laboratories. \n\nFun... Sure. We are big CSI fans and it was worth the groupon purchase and time spent (glad we didn't pay full price.) Would have preferred a challenge and would have paid more if it WAS challenging. \n\nSomeone should check to ensure the crime scenes still have all props. Whole exhibit probably needs to be updated in general.
2,"The hotel and rooms are all very clean and comfortable (good size, full kitchen, etc).   I ding them for (1) location is far away from just about anything (2) pool is relatively small for the number of rooms (and hence very crowded).\n\nWe travel with 1 pre-teen child and have had better experiences/rooms at Treasure Island and MonteCarlo so won't be back here."
4,This place is awesome.  Hands down.  Stop reading this and go already!
4,This is a great casual restaurant. The food tastes amazing. The prices are fair (and don't forget that check in bonus). The staff are always friendly. I've been a loyal fan of Golden Greek for years. And I may have found a new favorite gyro in the valley. If only they could have GG's puffy pitas!\n\nThe Greek fries are amazing. The reddish/pink dipping sauce is addictive. And the rice tastes great. I do kind of wish that the shwarma wraps had a sour pickle in them but that is probably just a personal preference.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone that wants casual Mediterranean food in the west valley.
2,Its Subway. Thats about all their is to say about this place. I will say it is a very clean well run store and the owner takes pride in this location.
3,"Excellent location.  Huge Resort, Casino, Pool, dining selection within (but u shouldn't limit yourself) and great entertainment options.  \n\nResort rooms are ok, large and comfortable.  But you can find that anywhere in Vegas.  Price may be an issue for Friday & Saturday nights.  \n\nDon't forget it's Vegas and lots & lots of walking (night/day) even if you're not planning on leaving the resort.  Why rent a car?  Unless you're there for biz.  If you share cab fares you'll save more and not run the risk of end up on Cops, Taxi Cab Confessions is more likely...  jeje\n\nDid not do Studio 54 but Tabu was great, sexy/hot and some stargazing is possible although pricey drinks for Vegas.  Great Dancers up on the stages/tables but it can get a bit crowed at peek 12mid + pretty much every night, they close Tuesdays.   Check them out: http://www.mgmgrand.com/nightlife.\n\nI did not know the $20 trick, I'll try it next time cuz I'm coming back to the MGM Grand.  Thanks Michael P!"
4,"This review is about the night club MINX on the top floor of THEHotel.\n\nAwesome views of the strip.  There are several small long white mini tables that sit next to the railing, so you can set your drink down and view the strip.\n\n We ended up here for NBA all star weekend.  We went early at 8pm, got in Free on Saturday night, and I guess it was for some NBA allstar party.  Awesome right...\n\nWe ended up standing and drinking next to Amari Stoudlemire for about 30 minutes, didn't know it was him until people started gawking.  Then he left...so the cool factor definitely went up.  This place must bring in the Celebs at times.  We met a new couple who we had long conversations with.  That brought the friendly factor up as well.\n\nWe ended up dancing on the dance floor, which was small, but the music was not that bad.   Maybe due to the el vino flowing...\n\nOverall drinks were reasonably priced for a vegas club, 9 dollars a drink.  I would recommend this place for a chill but aggressive night out on the town."
1,"Went with my family for New Years Eve.  The drinks were weak and they left the doors open so we were freezing!  Overrated!  This location lacks a personality- it a cookie cutter version of Buffet's tropical locations.  On the plus side, the bar food was great but I wouldn't probably go back... Definitely not for New Years Eve!"
1,"Hype machine in full motion here. I love to support downtown business and Ricky did offer to replace our pizzas but striking out after two pizzas, one named after downtown, really hurt. I'm New York born and this is not really good pizza, its really glitzed up pizza. Verrazano's south is much better for my tastes, Pop up pizza was better, and Settebello crushes them on authentic. The place is nice but looks a lot like Vamps. Good beers on tap. Really good music, but the prices are high and where is the food quality or the award winning chef? Even had farmers market items on the menu, but I never got to hear the specials. Oh well, a one and done."
4,"Where can you go to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh, tasty, satisfying dishes that you can eat your fill and be sure the quality will be there every time you go? M Resort Buffet. We have been there at least a dozen times now and it has been consistent each time. \n\nThere are many choices, all unique. Sometimes I have a hard time making it past the salads, there are so many to choose from and so very different than your usual fair at other buffets, I crave the tabouli salad! \n\nI love a big plate of steamed crab legs, and I usually start off with such, I love cracking the shells, pulling them apart one section at a time, dipping the meat in the clarified butter. Once I'm satisfied with this plate, I can move on to the many other stations, all just as satisfying. \n\nOne more must have is the deserts, take a big plate and don't be shy, load it up! The creme brulee is terrific, the warm brownie cup is melt in your mouth good, and the little cups of flavor, like the pistachio raspberry mouse is wonderful. \n\nIf you enjoy eating, love to try good food, you must stop by the M and try Studio B, believe me, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Yummy! Seriously best.steak.ever. My boyfriend and I went here for his Bday last August, and it was the best place we could have gone...we both still talk about it and want to go back. Really classy place, and we had excellent service. \n\nI will be back..."
4,"I can't say enough good things about Deana. Over the last five years, we've moved quite a lot and I never got a chance to find that hairstylist I love - well, not anymore, Deana is incredible. So personable, fun and passionate about all things hair-related. I'm always hesitant to try new things with my hair, but Deana has never led me wrong and I leave always loving my hair, plus get lots of complements. I would recommend her to anyone, and already have!"
0,"I have flown into Las Vegas more times than I care to recall, but I have to say that this is by far the worst experience that I ever had with the TSA and the security lines. Because I am a frequent business traveller, I was able to take advantage of the first class/ premier security check-in lines going to the D gates. As always, I do my best to be friendly to the environment so instead of printing out my boarding pass, I have it electronically downloaded to my iPhone. \n\nAfter waiting in this ungodly long line for 20 minutes (there were only 2 TSA agents dedicated to us to check our IDs and boarding passes and there must have been 50 of us in line), we were told that there was only 1 functioning electronic boarding pass reader and it was at the first position all the way at the other end (our line is at the opposite end). When I asked them what I need to do to get through, they said that I would have to walk out and over to the other line. There were well over 400 people in the regular line. 4 of us came up and had electronic boarding passes. I said that this was unacceptable and that a supervisor would need to take care of us. The TSA agent called for a supervisor and we waited another 5 minutes for one to show up. When she arrived, it seemed like she was more interested in cleaning up trash than attending to our issue. When we explained what happened, she said to just walk over to the other side and go to the TSA agent. I told her that someone should escort us over there so that the other passengers don't think that we are cutting in line. She was uninterested, told us that we should have a paper boarding pass, and walked away. At this point, I was fuming as well as the 3 other passengers. Finally, I took the intiative and flagged down a non-supervisory TSA employee and he graciously escorted us over to the scanner and personally checked our ID and let us pass. \n\nI have to tell you, there were at least 10 positions open to check IDs and boarding passes and having just one functioning electronic boarding pass scanner is unacceptable. I don't have this problem at other airports. I have learned my lesson as well as should you. From my experience, please do yourself a favor and have a paper boarding pass printed out just in case the system fails as it did horribly in this case. \n\nMcCarran Airport, you have made this a bad experience for me today and hopefully this is one of those rare instances. Ignorant TSA supervisor, please go back and get some training because your behavior resulted in an EPIC FAIL today.\n\nAt least it will be nice to get back home and enjoy the weekend. TGIF!!!"
4,"This is an amazing lunch spot.  I'm not normally a huge fan of middle-eastern/mediterranean food, but this place never disappoints.  Get the chicken and bulgar rice and point at a few side items. Expect a 15-20 minute wait during peak lunch hours, but it's always worth it."
0,"STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!  This place will not last long.  The servers act like frightened dogs.  The management is argumentative.  Your soda comes in a plastic bottle.  The music is so loud it could make a Slipknot fan complain about auditory pain after dining there.  The server tries to force you to order your entree at the same time as your appetizers and when confronted as to why you need to order our entree right away they smugly answer like mindless buffoons \""Cuz that's the way we do it here\"".  By far the worse dining experience we have ever had in Vegas.  We didn't even get past the drinks before leaving that abortion of a restaurant. If you want a comparable dining experience for a lot less money, then do yourself a favor and go to the Double Down on Paradise and scrape the dried sputum off the floor and put it on a plate.  You won't even be able to tell the difference between that and  Martorano's complimentary bread with ground rat meat they place on the table prior to cattle prodding you into ordering.  I know it's an Italian restaurant so mind my French when I say this place SUCKS!"
3,"First time eating here and it won't be my last!!!\n\nFor anyone who is looking for a quick, quality sandwich under 10 bucks I would highly recommend Jimmy John's. The service is excellent and one of the first things I noticed is how clean the restaurant was kept. I order the Gargantuan and it was a filling sub. Cold cuts were fresh, sliced thin, and piled high. All in all.. Great sandwich! Cant wait to explore the rest of the menu."
4,"We chose Ticoz for my father's B-day dinner Monday 9/28. My dad enjoys their sister restaurants so we thought we'd try it & we were NOT Disappointed! Matt was our delightful server. I should start off by stating that Phoenix in general has showcased it's customer service industry (be it food svc, hardware stores, grocery stores..what have you) as BEYOND POOR. Matt made our evening special & worth me writing in. To start I requested extra pineapple salsa bc I heard it was yummy. He went above & beyond by bringing out 3 sides of it!!! Secondly my stepmother is a coffeeaholic & her cup was NEVER EMPTY. I MEAN NEVER. Matt ran his butt off to refill our waters, teas, coffee, happy hour drinks. He brought my dad a bday dessert. Overall he did everything right: he was educated on vegan/vegetarian dishes (again a very appreciated asset in Phx), he made great happy hour drink suggestions, he never rushed us or acted like we were inconveniencing him by asking questions etc, food was beautiful, perfect temp and he picked my dad's dish which he ate EVERYTHING ON THIS Plate except the lime rind & loved it. He's got the up sell rule in place bc he brought a dessert menu which we bought 2 additional desserts. He also told us of some promotional offers they restaurant had going on etc. All in all when we return to Ticoz or switch we WILL be asking for Matt. On a side note the restaurant was clean, had nice lighting & decor, ladies bathroom was nice, greeters/hosts were quick to greet which is always a plus  and they asked our seating preference. KUDOS TICOZ!!!!!"
2,Got some sammies to go.  Lil pricey....I got the large Sausage and peppers sandwich.  Good and tasty but pretty messy. Taste was great but for the price it could of been bigger.  Hate to compare a place to Capriaottis but they do give you a good size for the price. I will go back......if I got a coupon or two for one groupon type deal.
0,"Generally, I like IHOP for a quick, generous, plain meal. \n\nNot this branch.  It advertises right up front: \""Family owned and operated.  No coupons or discounts accepted.\""  That sets the tone. \n\nOnce your server has taken your order and (maybe) delivered it correctly, you're on your own if you want to attract her attention again -- even through the place is usually three-quarters empty.  Surly, unpleasant, uncaring attitude from the top down.\n\nAt other IHOPs, I sub extra salsa for sour cream on my southwestern-style omelets.  Never a problem.  Here, they hit you an extra charge.   \n\nNo point complaining to the manager.  It's \""family owned,\"" remember? You think they're going to fire mom or sis? Dream on. \n\nBetter yet, stay away.  There are PLENTY of other restaurants in that area, and every one of them is better."
4,"As long as you don't mind feeling like the hipster you know you are, dear Yelp reader, this place is awesome. \n\nWe were staying in the old town and Ubered out to this place for lunch because we had heard good things. It was well worth it. Awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome hallumi sandwich, awesome lemonade and pleasant seats outside. \n\nLots of talk at the table next to us about getting some \""studio time\"" to \""lay down some tracks\"", so in addition to having really good sandwiches, Le Pickup must also be really cool.\n\nPS, there's a bike station right next to the shop."
4,Newer restaurant tucked away in the Stratford plaza behind Dutch brothers. I've been here 3 times since they opened. I've enjoyed everything so far. I would definitely give it a try.
4,Dr. Ed and his wife are the greatest. I highly recomend them. Dr. Ed is extremely knowledgable and truly cares about the well being of his patients. If you are in need of chiropractic care you would be doing yourself a huge disservice by not coming here. That is a PROMISE!!!!
3,"I've stayed here, oh, a few hundred nights over the past few years.  Helpful staff who work hard, close to ASU, and a good value."
2,"Decent sushi, nothing that I would NEED to go back for.  \n\nI'm not an all-you-can-eat sushi type of girl, actually I'm not an al-you-can-eat anything type of girl...and I'm not opposed to spending good money on a sushi experience.  I was there during their \""happy hour\"" and most everything on the menu was 50% off.  I wasn't paying attention to prices, but I ordered screaming orgasm, and it turned out to be 5 pieces of too-thick tuna for $17.  Totally overpriced for what it was."
2,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed."
0,"My girlfriend and I were walking over try to Plato's closet and she noticed a 3.xx Turkey sub poster on the door. We walk in and I'm debating what to get and my girlfriend recommends the special to me. All this time the older guy at the counter is standing right there... But he rings it up our order as 11.xx. I ask about this and in a voice of pure contempt he says \""if you'd read the sign properly...\""  Dude, I get that I missed the fine print but you don't have to be a complete jerk about it. Didn't eat, won't come again."
3,"Love the food, staff and ambiance of the place.  I have been eating there for 4 years and just love it.  My favorite dish is the 2 fish tacos with black beans.  They also have great wines at good prices."
3,"So Rob Thomas was playing in Vegas this past Saturday, so i thought why not get a room and spend some time in Vegas and have some fun.. once purchased the tickets the question was where to stay..\n \nWe arrived at the Palms Place on Friday at around 7pm. We pulled in to Valet, which immediately strikes you as a posh New York boutique hotel... Lobby was nice, no casino, no line...checked-in in 10 minutes.\n \n29th floor room, with a balcony, jet tub, separate dual shower, Aveda stuff, 2 40\"" TVs.. nice.. i did good, thought to myself, he likes the room..\n\nThis place is or was intended as a residential property therefore there isn't much variety of restaurants or bars, but their only bar called Rojo Lounge was more than perfect. \nThe pool, area is not the best or the nicest in Vegas for sure but its all you need. relaxing, quick and attentive service, decent pool-side food, not too crowded.. (god, i just realized relaxing was the first thing that came to mind i must be getting old)\n\nWe spent 48 hours here and it was good times, worth the money, i was happy, and the smiles i got from him from time to time made it priceless."
0,"Little Darlings is such a scam  they said dances were  top-less??? No they aren't topless they show you a nip from far away and if u try to get closer they call a bouncer then they kick u out like a dog after you pay $20 cover and $350 private rooms are shit, I got this girls they were snooty and they just ordered drinks on our tab and they didn't even dance.... Such a scam they're dirty they stink"
3,"What a delightful place! I brought a visiting friend here when she wanted to experience something different after I showed her around the Valley for several days. We decided to do the high tea (as recommended by Linda R's review here in yelp). My friend chose a lavander-blended tea and I had the peach-ginger tea -- two extraordinarily fragrant and delicious choices that went so well with the cakes, sandwiches, scones, and cookies in the 3-tiered server. The elegant meal (yes, I think it should be considered a meal) and the beautiful surroundings made our trip to Carefree so much more memorable.\n\n(Note: English Rose Accents is a gift shop located next door to the English Rose Tea Room. For that, see http://www.yelp.com/biz/english-rose-accents-carefree)"
1,"stopped in here yesterday late afternoon for a little happy hour treat. after we were seated in the bar by the hostess nobody came over to take our order. almost 10 - 15 minutes later the hostess came by again and asked if anyone came by for drinks and when we said no she brought somebody over. i didn't catch our waiters name but he took our drink order along with a side of chicken nachos and gave us some water. the glasses that were brought over were really warm though. no ice water was served here. i could tell my boyfriend was a little displeased. After being thirsty for an hour of mall walking i know he wanted some nice, cold water. he was pleased they had one of his favorite beers though, modelo especial. i ordered a frozen prickly pear margarita ($4.95) while Dan T. ordered his beer. Another 10 minutes went by before we got our drinks. Dan enjoyed his beer and my margarita was refreshing. A little too sweet but it is the first margarita i have had in months so i shouldn't complain. i recommend the prickly pear to the ladies and gents who prefer to not taste their alcohol. i had no idea i was getting anything. about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos. they didn't warn us the plate was burning hot so my hand almost melted when i touched it grabbing some nachos. OW! they weren't bad. i wish the bottom part didn't consist of 8 nachos turned one because of melted cheese. the guacamole and tomatos were not spread out, but one of each on the side. weird. i do wish they were all over and messy though. it mostly consisted of melted cheese and chicken. the meat wasn't bad, but it should have had a little more flavor to it.\nI don't know if i will be back. wasn't awful and disgusting, but nothing really made me say wow between the drink and the nachos. it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me. i had such better hopes for this place. oh well. i'll stick to dos caminos if i am over in the area."
3,"Stopped by for the 2nd time on Friday with my sister and my nephews because the 6 y/o stated he wanted grilled cheese and not our normal pizza and we knew they had it from the last time we were there.\n\nWe were sat right away.  Our server wasn't the friendliest but she made sure drinks were refilled and she stopped by a few times to check on us.  I tried the Californian chicken sandwich this time and it was really good.  It was basically chicken with roasted vegetables and melted cheese on an onion roll.  The roll was soo good, it was soft and chewy and I liked it a lot.  The bread they bring to the table is good too, 2 rolls and 2 pieces of cornbread, all warm and very tasty.\n\nKids enjoyed their grilled cheeses, but my sister was not happy with her BLT, it came with cheese on it which she didn't know and she is lactose intolerant, and it had hardly any bacon.  Also, we opted to do salads instead of fries with our meals and our server said it was an upcharge to substitute and we said fine.  When we got the bill it wasn't an upcharge they just charged for a regual salad, thought that was a little lame."
3,Enjoyed breakfast this morning and our waitress Cece was the best.  Definitely recommend this place.
3,"I love that they are now at Canyon Ridge church on weekends, they have a great grinds, the coffee is so good, get a jolt of energy.   woot woooooooo"
0,"Had the crab cakes. .  Mistake. .  Dry,  not much flavor. . Worse,  the rice and plantains were baked to the point that it was a dry lump with burned wood flavor"
2,"Very accommodating place as they found a table for the five of us even on a Friday night even without a reservation.  \n\nSo why the 3 stars?  Personally I thought the steak (NY Strip) was only okay and for a $44 steak I was expecting a little more.  My cousin got the lamb chop which he found to be extremely good (though he thought the Wynn buffet lamb chops were a better value).  The bacon and cheddar mash potato was very, very satisfying.   On the other hand, you can probably skip the fries though as it was meh."
1,"I would say calling the breakfast here \""mediocre\"" would be a compliment. \nThe omelet I ordered was simple, just bacon & cheese...nothing too crazy..I could get soooo much better at an Ihop, if you can believe it!\nIt was just too much egg and the cheese mixed in it did not taste good. It tasted a mix of bland and old and really needed some sort of saltiness to it. I couldn't eat a bite of it alone without some of the bacon on my fork as well. \nNot interested in the pumpkin or banana bread, I opted for the english muffin that was saturated in.......something? Didn't taste like butter, as it had NO taste whatsoever! \n\nThe coffee? I could write a 9 page paper on how terrible the coffee was. Ridiculously bad. Horrifying even. \n*sigh* Disappointed with Omelet House...I've gone here before when they were at one point opened super late, and it reminded me so much of the delicious diners back east. \n\nThe only good points: my husband's BATTERED onion rings (scored a point for battered!) and the odd chip-like potatoes that were served with my breakfast were actually very good!"
2,I went into get some knobs for my AC.  I walked around the store for a few minutes unable to find them.  When I asked the gentleman at he counter he insisted they did not sell them.  I let him know their website indicated they were in the store.  A woman behind he counter overheard me and led us to them.  I got the sense the guy was pretty new and the lady seemed like a manger.  Three stars for having my parts and eventually helping me get them.  I did get the sense everyone in the store wasn't on the same page.
4,"Damn you, Chef Beni.  Your food is so good, the Mesa Grilles of this world have lost a lot of their allure.\n\nI can't imagine sitting down to a better, more playful or expertly prepared array of dishes than I had last evening at your place -- especially at the price.  You, sir, on onto something.  Like a comedian who tells jokes that make him laugh, you cook what you like, and invite us to \""get it\"", or not.\n\nOf the tapas we ordered (the sweet potato fries, 4 cheese mac and congrejo to name but three) I'm at a loss to name a favorite.  The whole, trully, was greater than the sum.  Ah, but as for the desserts -- I hope to be buried with an order of your churros with chili chocolate sauce nestled by my side.\n\nNo dining experience can be exceptional without an attentive staff.  Yours was, and then some.  But what put the evening over-the-top was when you stopped by our table to chat (not just the cursory \""hello\""), but actually discuss some of your ideas and inspirations.  Your quirky pedigree explains much of your menu and kitschy surroundings.\n\nIn a few days, I leave for home (East Bay, Ca), and there I will sing the praises of a restaurant unlike any other in my \""foodie\"" neck of the woods.\n\nDamn you, Chef Beni.\n\nGo west."
1,"First off let me tell you why they didn't get 4 stars. Booked two room connected with view of the strip. First room was connected but sadly no view of strip only of vents on lower part off roof. Room door was open and looked ransacked. Turns out small mistake had been made. Housekeeping had not cleaned the room yet. They apologize d and moved us from the 3rd floor to the 23rd floor but still no view of the strip. Hallways are kinda narrow but all in all. This is a great place to stay. Location, location M&M store, Coca-cola store, Lion exhibit MGM and Shark reef at Mandalay Bay. There's also a CVS near by. I'll be staying here again but will hope for better experience. But like I said great location to bad Circus Circus is on far end of strip.\n."
4,Wow wow wow the staff here is pretty phenomenal! Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We met the chef. He was wonderful. We asked if they had the scallops tonight. Unfortunately they didn't but we decided to stay. They treated us like royalty. They Set up the a table on the patio for us. Our server was John and he was truly amazing. So kind and helpful with evrything. Even when The steak came over cooked he didn't make it uncomfortable at all to ask for replacement. The new steak that came was one of the best I've ever had. And the presentation was stunning. Loved every minute.
3,"Awww, Shania! With your very public life struggles, beautiful voice and gorgeous music videos, I've always had a soft spot for you.\n\nI was very excited to receive complimentary tickets to Shania's show. I had never been in the Colosseum for one, and well, it's Shania! If you love Country-Pop, you know what this means.\n\nDrink prices were 'meh' but they were on par with other notoriously famous and successful venues.\n\nWe were seated and to my delight, we had 4th row orchestra seats! Shimmery flowy gold curtains adorned the stage. I didn't realize how BIG the stage was, until the curtains were pulled back.\n\nShania opens up with an upbeat number. Her costumes show off her still bangin' body (I hope I look that hot when I'm 47!).\n\nWhile her voice admittedly, isn't what it used to be (she did suffer vocal cord trauma), she still delivers a solid performance of both singing, dancing, and a yahoo good time.\n\nScene changes are smooth, her musical performers (dancers and musicians) are ALL good looking. They seem like they're having a lot of fun on stage as well.\n\nOne thing about her show that stood out for me-I've never had a smell-o-vision experience like this. She wants to stimulate all of your senses, it seems. Depending on the scene, there are aromas to go along with it. Musky campfire, sexy perfume aroma, one time I swore I was standing in a lush forest.\n\nCool show, for sure."
4,went in today to upgrade my phone from a I3 to I4.  I didn't like the first guy that greeted me so I just told him that I was Looking around.  then I was helped my Demarisa.  She was Great and Awsome.  She helped me by getting a refund on my monthly charged since I Stopped my service on one of my other phones but was still getting charged for the data plan on it.  and that was a savings of $200.00.  Then we changed my service plan from a family plan to a indivisual plan which saved me another $100.00 a month.  that was very great and I thanked her very much for that since i think I would not have gotten the same service from the the first guy that greeted me.  So I'm glad I decided to trust my instincts on this one.
0,"Pretty terrible, even with a hangover. \n\nI wouldn't have eaten here unless I was desperate for eggs...and that's exactly what happened.  It's a tourist trap restaurant in a busy location with no reason to bring local patrons back.  \n\nSmall eggs, overly onioned potatoes, mushy, cheap sausages, the service was rushed... All sorts of things to keep this place off my breakfast/brunch list.\n\nI'm quite certain I will never ever return."
0,"One of the worst shops I've ever been in.  The owner, Robert, is horrible and doesn't know what he's doing at all. This shop doesn't even deserve one star but it's the lowest it'll let me go. I took my 13 year old daughter in there and Robert did nothing but try to flirt with her and stare at her like a piece of meat! This place is so unprofessional and the piercing Robert did came out completely crooked and wasn't even deep enough in the tissue to stay in. If you care about quality you should stay away from this shop. No joke."
0,"This place is less than honest. We turned up on a Saturday evening at 7 pm,  we were the only customer, afterwards, there were three more when we left. We ordered the dish \""meat lover\"" for the hungry  at 39.95-, which was supposed to include prime rib eye, Kobe chuck and Kobe rib eye\"". To our surprise, a waiter came up silently with a plate that has one row of meat  undistinguished of any kind, Kobe or not, it all looks alike  . next, it was worse when we tasted it, it was less than fresh, and for a hungry meat lover, it was a real bad experience that mad us run away. We then tried to stop by Monday at lunch time, to make our complaint, the manager duly took note and said he would review the camera in the kitchen and contact us, alas, we never heard of him again, so we assumed the the camera did not lie!!!!"
2,"Pros: Fun atmosphere, very casual (borderline dive), attentive staff, relatively cheap.\nCons: food just ok. \n\nMaybe I got the wrong thing (ceviche tacos). I'm willing to try again."
0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible service!  I had just arrived from California, it was hot and I was starving.  I wanted Mexican so I decided to give this a whirl.  Granted we got there at 8 and they close at 10, but still.  Hostess sat us down and handed us menus.  No one came for about 15 minutes until I got up to notify the hostess.  She said \""oh, sorry there must have been some confusion with the waiters. Uh, ok! She took our order, brought us out drinks and after we got our food, our server showed up.  A little too late I thought.   She asked if we needed refills and we said no.  My friend asked for a side of beans and the girl forgot, says \""oh no I forgot about those but I'll make sure they're pipping hot when they come out\"".  She was a complete airhead!  The food was mediocre at best!  Won't be going back to this place, yuck!"
4,"We came here to satisy my sweet tooth and given that I am done with Mary Coyle. I had only been here once before to get coffee and always meant to come back. Boy, am I glad I did! After dinner, the four of us took a walk down to Pink Spot. I took a look at their menu online so I knew what I wanted. I ordered the one scoop Black-n-White sundae but substituted Mint Choco Chip ice cream. It was great. The girl layered the brownie, hot fudge, and mint chocolate all the way to the top of the cup and topped it with whipped cream and nuts. I loved the multiple layers. We also got a chocolate covered banana for my husband (which caused endless jokes from me...could NOT resist!), and two kids' ice cream scoops. The total? $11. Pretty shocking given I just spent a little over $8 for one regular ice cream sundae the other night at Mary Coyle. Everything was really good and the best part was we could burn calories walking to and from Pink Spot. On the way out of this place, my husband noticed that they do bagel boxes (dozen bagels) for about $13 so I'll definitely need to come here when I want to bring bagels for the office. I would much rather support the local business than go to Einstein's for bagel buckets."
2,"The Dor-Stop was crowded and we did have to wait for about 10 minutes.  Not to bad on a Sunday morning.  Waitress was quick to get coffee to us.  It did take a little longer than you would expect to get the meal...we all started to get really hungry.  \n\nOrdered the Eggs Benedict, which were pretty ordinary.  Comes with the ordinary home fries."
2,Its an airport....... they are constantly building and adding on to this airport. It is definitely growing and getting huge.
1,"I was SERIOUSLY looking forward to this place. i had hyped it up cuz other people had hyped it up. \n\nI tried the cheeseburger as well as the fries. I want to say, it was average. Nothing stood out, nothing special, nothing really different. And I think the reason my review is not too good has a lot to do with the price. It was very expensive for what I was getting. I'd rather go eat at In 'n Out for the similar experience but for cheaper. If I'm paying more than that, I expect better food. \n\nThe fries were nicely flavored but were too soggy for me. I personally just like my fries crispy. \n\nCool decor, and the free peanuts made up for the price and quality of food.\nThis was the first and possibly the last Five Guys I'll ever visit. if i go back, I'll try the secret menu or patty melt that someone yelp'd."
0,"I must admit I came with high expectations, but I should if I am paying $16 for a hamburger, just a burger no fries, no sides.  I had the truffle parmesan (garlic)  fries, which had little flavor considering the bold ingredients melded with the fries. \n\nThe farm burger sounded amazing, but the flavors never developed. The pub was cold and dry, the duck breast bacon was great, but when it was on the burger the flavor was lost. \n\nThe service was bad as well. I sat at the bar, and the guy helping me was more concerned about picking up on a female bar tender than helping any of the customers. He was also really rude to the guy sitting next to me because the guy did not speak good English and was having trouble ordering. I love Gordon Ramsay's other establishments, but this one is totally not worth a visit. \n\nIf you ever come to LA and want to have an amazing burger, try the Dog Haus' Little Mule and you will find true heaven. Burgr is closer to a meal from hell..."
3,"I used ZeroRez on the carpets of our new house. The previous owner had a dog and left behind some pet stains.  I did an extra 40 dollars on the pet stained rug, and they did not come out 100% - However, the technician warned me that they were very bad stains... They are definitely not as noticeable anymore. Other stains mostly came out of the rugs except for where the previous owner laid an area rug right over the carpet, and where she had a metal heavy piece of furniture in the carpet.  The tech said that area rugs and metal can \""seep\"" permanently into rugs.,..\n\nI was not expecting the carpets to be 100% like new- So I am satisfied despite not getting everything out.  That being said, if I have to get carpets cleaned again, I may try Stanley Steemer, but I would still recommend Zero Rez.    I only say this because Zero Rez and Stanleys are 2 of the FEW carpet cleaners that are certified by the carpet and rug institute- See here by your area: http://www.carpet-rug.org/commercial-customers/cleaning-and-maintenance/soa-service-providers/service-providers.cfm\n\nHouse is 5 Rooms, 1 large closet, 13 stairs, 1 large hallway.  Quote for Stanley was 250, Quote for Zero Rez was 280 - actual price for zero rez was 323 with the extra pet treatment.  Kind of a lot for carpet cleaning I guess? Was my first time.  Anywho, I am satisfied and a fan of Zero Rez.  Techs were very nice and friendly, they did the house FAST, 2 hours or less."
4,"This was my first visit to Cabellero and I noticed that there draft selection had something for everybody which is always nice since I go out with friends. Especially since my preference goes from stouts and amber to lager - fruity ciders in this hot summer weather.\n\nI love ceviche, and they have a ceviche bar! \nNext time I definitely want to check out there Sunday brunch :)"
1,"This used to be good, until i got a room that was well.. Musty in odor and no Wi-Fi\n\nI found a bug in my room.... Well, that was not a good experience. \n\nIt could be better..."
2,"This place hovers between a 3- and 4-star rating. I saw the Groupon for La Bocca and didn't get it, because I'm not a pizza fan for the most part unless it's truly amazing. After dining there, I couldn't help comparing it with La Grande Orange Pizzeria: both boast gourmet pizzas and fancy appetizers with similar price points. I personally prefer LGO's pizza because of the better/thinner crust and higher-quality cheese. \n\nLa Bocca's wood-fired pizza -- for the record, the porco/pulled pork pizza -- did not give me the bubbling cheese impression when it first came out; instead, the cheese was stiff and lukewarm. Also, the pork pieces were scantily and unevenly distributed, hardly meaty at all. So don't mistake the porco pizza for a meat lover's heaven. The pulled pork was certainly porky (= greasy) but not juicy or flavorful.\n\nOn a side note, La Bocca's leftover pizza slices did not make a satisfying meal the following day -- the reheated dough was rock-hard and inedible. On the other hand, LGO's leftover pizza was still delicious 3 days later.\n\nAs for its famed bruschetta appetizers, I saw the appeal but didn't get it. We got prosciutto, pesto, garlic, and ricotta bruschettas. My reaction: Mehhh. They were filling (admittedly lots of carbs) but far from something I would go back for. They taste quite the same to me and the bread wasn't my favorite. \n\nIf you want to make good bruschetta at home, here's a recipe:\n\n1) sourdough crisps (from Costo)\n2) goat cheese\n3) fig jam\n4) Assemble 1 + 2 + 3. Voila!\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled by easy-and-yummy bruschettas I can make at home, I was definitely not impressed by what I spent $12 for in La Bocca. \n\nWe also got the sangria. A lot of alcohol for its price; also a lot of syrup. \n\nI agree La Bocca is a nice place to hang out with my ASU friends and a good alternative if I don't want to drive to LGO. It would be even nicer if I have a groupon to get a couple dollars off the bill. But it lacks the finess I was looking for in an outstanding pizzeria. Nice, but mediocre in my book.\n\nP.S. valet parking good for 2 hours if you park in the garage nearby."
1,"Food was good BUT the place was so filthy that I lost my appetite. It's an old 5 & diner restaurant, they haven't redecorated one ounce. You can literally scrape the dirt and grime off of the chairs, floor and walls. I can't imagine what the kitchen must look like!"
1,"this hotel looks great from the outside.  the food and beverage area leaves somthing to be desired.  the rooms were average at best.  I thought the room was tired looking.  this was not my pick and would not choose to stay here again.  not great, and not terriable.  The hotel now charges a $2.00 a day acess charge for the phone.  this is even the case if you make no calls!  a rip off in my book"
1,"I would have given 1-1.5 stars had the manager not tried to make it up to me and my party for the bad service by comping a few dishes. Despite that, I would rather have paid full price and gotten excellent service. \n\nThere are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from. My bad experience here has guaranteed that I will not be spending my money here again. \n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant with low lighting and lots of dark wood. It reflects the design in Aria, which I love a LOT! Very chic and minimalist but very stylish. \n\nThe food here was excellent. Very good tasting food. However, it took forever to come out and our mushroom sides, which probably takes the least amount of time to cook, came at the very end after we were finished with everything else. Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nOur waiter was nice but after he took our order, he seemed to have pulled a vanishing act. We didn't see him at all until we asked a busboy to find him for us. He was forgetful. I asked for straws 3x and he finally got me one. But I had asked for 4. He came back with 6 more. ???\n\nWhat annoyed us even more was that we were trying to enjoy our meals and the busboys removed our plates and dishes without asking first! We weren't even done with our food! Geeez just because we wanted to take our time to eat, savor the food and just chill, doesn't mean we're done. We were conversing and eating at the same time. We don't want to stuff our faces right away like a bunch of pigs. Just because we put our forks down doesn't mean we're done eating. My friend had to stop the busboy from taking her plate by pushing his hand away.\n\nSo after they removed our dishes and utensils, another dish came out. They totally forgot to give us new utensils. How the hell were we supposed to eat our Bolognese with??? Our hands?! We had to hail someone down after waiting for a while just to ask for forks. Really? \n\nFor a restaurant such as this, I really expected a lot more. The service wasn't even average. It just sucked. I give credit to where credit is due. This place doesn't make the cut for me. You're better off dining somewhere else. Try Julian Serrano or Beso. Much better."
2,Great station! I know you need memberships to stay alive but do you have to have membership drives every week. And beg during every commercial break. Its pretty irritating to already established members. Some of the djs have really obnoxious voices as well and they are usually the ones that talk the most. More music and less talk may get you the memberships you need.
0,"I have eaten here 5 times through various parts of the day throughout the past year and I have been unable to receive any sort of \""cooked\"" food from this location. Whether it is cold, pre-cooked chicken strips or an uncooked, partly frozen, butter soaked \""toaster,\"" I have had nothing but gag inducing experiences at this location. I usually like Sonic and what their menu has to offer, but it sucks that this, horrible location is closest to my house. I wish there was a way to give negative stars, because this location deserves it, especially since I work graveyard and this is one of the few places open when I get off of work."
3,Dj is cool. The place needs a theme ASAP
1,"5/19/10\n\n2.5 stars.\n\nDidn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  \n\nOrdered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!\n\nIt was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while..."
0,This restaurant closed down about a year (or more) ago.
0,"I didn't want to give a bad review but think it's needed. I went here few weeks ago on my lunch break. After waiting 40 minutes I informed the girl at the counter I now need it to go (lunch was almost over) no apology for how long it took. I then didn't have time to eat. I get cranky hungry! Not to mention it's pricey, Ecspecially when you need gluten-free. A lot of money to not eat. I decided to email the business to give them a heads up of the service (slow and not sorry). Figured a manager would care, nope. See why employees don't. No email apology or anything. Bummed, was excited for new gluten-free options."
0,"I have been eating a several Filiberto's over the years on and off. But I HAVE HAD IT with this location! Second time where the service was terrible! And now I see other people's reviews and must agree, i held back the first time from writing something negative. The girl at the window (FIRST POINT OF CONTACT) Dania, is rude, sarcastic and talks about you like you aren't in front of her in spanish. (she didn't know i also spoke spanish) And she just laughed in my face. The guy in the kitchen had to come out! I had a coupon(first time) and gave it at the window and was rejected \""with crappy attitude\"" and said that it couldn't be taken because the manager wasn't there. WHO DOES THAT? Why would you handle a coupon like that? Maybe you should write on the coupon \""ohh  yeah BTW if you wish to cash this in, please come between \""x\"" days and \""x\"" hrs. because that is when the manager will be here, and forbid she went to the bank or something. YOUR SCREWED! Anyway... that's the LAST TIME i go to that place by myself and will share with my friends! I wouldn't have minded paying full price. It was the LOUSY ATTITUDE since I first talked to her! Sorry for the owner who i just found out doesn't even go in to check that often. Maybe someone should go on \""Undercover Boss\"" Maybe have those guys in the kitchen that work the hardest that do try and speak Spanish and are friendly be in the front!"

3,"When I heard a few years ago that they were opening a bookstore at SouthPark Mall, I thought, \""Yea!  They're in need of one.\""  When I heard it was Joseph-Beth Booksellers, I said, \""Who?\""  Turns out, Joseph-Beth has that little bookstore feel, but can compete with the Big Guys (i.e., Barnes & Noble and Borders) with regard to size, pricing, and even bargain books.  Also, their kids' area seems bigger than B&N or Borders and is fun to stroll through, even as an adult.  Joseph-Beth was a great addition to SouthPark and even better for them that the Big Guys aren't attached to the mall to compete with them.  \n\nI tried their cafe once and felt a little awkward.  We wanted some coffee and a little snacky snack.  What was awkward was that it wasn't counter service, so we had to sit at a table and order our carb snack.  Then, of course, there's the tipping.  For muffins.  Awkward."
3,"In the words of one of my friends.  \""I even take my really expensive jeans there to get them hemmed.\""  \n\nI agree that they can be slow, but if you push them some they can give you a better turn around time.  The only complaint was that on my last time in there they measured up my kaki pants but did nothing with the butt... when I asked them they said yea it looks bad and then went to hem it in... I would have liked for them to tell me in the begging that my booty was swimming in my britches."
1,Stopped by here with LiLy D to grab a quick bite. \n\nWe were in a rush so I just got pho tai. The waiter doesn't come by to check to see if I'm ready to order. He doesn't come by to check to see how everything is. They charge $1.50 for tea...wtf?\n\nThanks for picking up the check LiLy!
2,"The most important thing to remember is that we'd come to Archie's specifically for wings.  Fifteen cent chicken wings.  Monday to Thursday.  I haven't really been looking all that hard for cheap wings, but this sounded like a deal.  And I didn't have to know what day it was, and still I would have a better than 50/50 shot at fifteen cent wings?  I don't know this 'Archie' guy, but he didn't really twist my arm to get me in the door.\n\nAs it turns out, you need to buy a drink to be eligible for the fifteen cent wings.  I would have preferred to consume my wings with water--I am something of a wing purist*--but I am not above drinking an adult beverage in order to take advantage of an 80% discount on tiny pieces of spicy, fried, exceptionally messy chicken.  And fortunately, Archie's is a bar.  \n\nAt first, I tried to order Johnny Walker Black, rocks.  But our waitress did not know if they carried that brand of liquor (they did not), so I requested a dry, slightly dirty Tanqueray martini and a glass of water.  A number of minutes later I caught her eye across the room, and she assured me my drink was on its way, having been delayed slightly by something to do with someone 'forgetting about it'.  Several more minutes passed, and she approached me sheepishly.  Empty-handed.  As it turns out, besides lacking Johnny Walker, Archie's lacks vermouth.  Fighting off my confusion, I took a few minutes to browse the bar by myself, wanting to avoid the embarrassment of ordering a third obscure and impossible to obtain beverage.  I finally ended up with a glass of Speyburn.  The glass of Speyburn was almost entirely identical to a glass of scotch, except that half of it seemed to be a glass of water.  Which, I suppose, was what I had really wanted the entire time.\n\nSoon after this drama, there were wings.  They were fried and spicy and messy and cost fifteen cents apiece, so the evening turned out almost exactly as I'd hoped.  But when I say that, it is important for you to remember that we had come to Archie's specifically for wings.  \n\n*This MIGHT be a lie.  I don't know what would make someone a wing purist, but I do know that I'll eat just about any wings you put in front of me.  If that makes me a purist, then I am glad to have written it.  And if it makes me the opposite of a purist, well, I'm not losing any sleep."
1,"I've never left a bad review before but I was extremely disappointed in my experience in the bar of The Keg in Tempe Wednesday night. While I must say our server was fantastic, everything else was blah. \n\nI met some friends for drinks and appetizers. The first drink I had was the Orange Slice. I've had this in the past at a different Keg location and enjoyed it. But this time, I thought I could taste the chlorinated Phoenix water in the drink. I didn't say anything to our server but I decided to order a different drink the next round. My second drink was an Old Fashioned. This drink is made with bourbon, bitters, lemon, orange, sugar and soda. So I couldn't understand why it tasted extremely watered down. This time I said something to the server. I thought it might be the soda water that had ruined these drinks. She checked with the manager and then returned recommending I avoid a drink made with soda. The manager did not stop by. I sent the drink back and ordered a Manhattan. The Manhattan is described on the menu as being made with bourbon, vermouth, and \""house-made drunken Bing cherries\"". Cherries. Plural. The drink arrived with a single MARASCHINO cherry. Not the house-made cherries I was expecting and looking forward to. This drink also tasted watered down, as if it sat in the mixer cup over ice much too long. My friend ordered a spiked tea. It, too, was extremely watered down! I blame the bartender for our disappointing experience. One of my friends had a steak and was quite pleased with her meal. In the future, IF I ever do return to this restaurant, I will only choose wine or beer because the bartender either does not know how to make cocktails, or she was skimping on listed ingredients to save the restaurant money."
0,Staff is quick to judge patrons and unfriendly when confronted about situations
3,"For the price (avg $4.95/per entree), the dishes are a great value.   While I know Korean food tends to be on the sweet side, I found it a bit too sweet for my taste, all dishes were solidly made and were nice portions.   I also wanted hot sauce on everything, and they happily offered Sriracha sauce.  \n\nService was attentive.  The decor is really \""clean\"" and tastefully done."
0,"I have never been so disappointed by the service in my entire life. I had been to this place once before and it was fine, but the second time around, it was terrible!!! Our waiter was rude. When we ordered a beer, a coke, and a glass of water, he snarkily responded, \""Oh yeah, part-tay!\"" We were there with a person who had a food allergy and we asked him for a suggestion of what he could order, and the watier responded in a very dismissive manner. \""Just tell me what you want to eat,\"" he said. When we mentioned that two of us were planning to share a bucket of chicken, he suggested we go for the large version. Now neither my friend nor I are Jabba the Hutt, so there was no way in hell two people could finish so much chicken. He then forgot to place our order and left without telling us he was switching servers. We had to order again after 30 minutes and when the food did come, it was giant baseballs of chicken and they were thrown unceremoniously on the table on a brown paper mat. There were two measly halves of a biscuit thrown in with the chicken, and when we bit into one of them, we noticed that it had the consistency of chewing gum and realized that it was still raw. We thought that they were apologizing by giving us a discount on the chicken (charging us for the small bucket rather than the large), but after we paid, our waitress realized that she had mixed up our order with someone else's. We were then forced to pay for this disgusting bucket of chicken.  Wouldn't recommend this to even Jabba the Hutt!\n\nhttp://farm5.staticflickr.com/4129/4981059066_371157fce0.jpg"
1,"This place is pretty dingy.  Sure, you might find a decent brand here or there, but it's not worth digging through the racks of absolute CRAP to find it.  When it comes to clothes and shoes, I prefer Savers.  I don't like Savers, so that should tell you something.  The worst of it is the shoes - oh my goodness.  Some of the pairs they have don't even really constitute SHOES anymore... missing soles and heels, lace-up shoes without tongues... I've seen it all.\n\nPlus one for the furniture.  I would say that about 30% of the furniture in my current apartment is from this Salvation Army (mostly tables, a desk, and our headboard and footboard).  The prices are usually fair and they have some interesting things from time to time.  Unless I'm looking for something specific, though, I usually don't bother."
0,"I will no longer be a 'regular' at this spot. While their late hours and wine selection are nice, their hot drink orders failed me countless times. At first, the said they had to charge me for a full latte if I had MY OWN milk to add to a double espresso. So instead I ordered a hot tea. While I waited I noticed their counters completely filthy from the coffee grounds and spilled drinks. NOT pleasant. Not only did the barista spill the hot drink of my hand while passing it over to me, the top of the cup was so flimsy that two cup sleeves had to be added to make the cup stable. As I went to add honey to my tea, I was welcomed with a sticky mess that made everything sticky. Additionally they were out of all utensils, straws and stir sticks (anything to stir the honey in). Needless to say, I was not happy with Barriques."
1,"Based upon a review from someone else here, I made a reservation for Saturday night.  I was running late and called the restaurant to alert them that I will be late and I was told that the reservation was cancelled. When I arrived, the hostess squeezed me to the front of the line and I got a table right away. Unfortunately, I had to wait awhile for the server to come over to our table.  The server described some specials.  I first ordered the tortilla soup and it was delicious.  Next up, was my steak. I ordered the New York steak. It was cooked to my liking but it was very dry. I also didn't like the fact that everything at this restaurant was a-la-carte.  The p[ices were very high.  My wife ordered the pizza and she said that it was very salty. The manager addressed the issue without resistance or hesitation and allowed us to order something else.  After we ate, we bought some gelato in the candy shop and that was pretty good.  Based upon the high prices along with the poor tasting food, I will not return here.    In addition, there was some sort of additional surcharge placed on my bill because the restaurant is located on the strip! I'm a local and never heard or was charged a fee in the past for eating at a restaurant on the strip."
1,"It was packed when I got there. I had a French toast and it was truly infamous. Service is slow and I even had to pay for the regular coffee. The potatoes were not cooked enough and fruit is not included. The place next door is better, just walk a little bit and you'll get a better brunch."
0,This place was very disappointing. When AA Wholesome used to be located inside Super L Ranch it used to be lot better than this place. I bought whole bag full of bread & pastries and only that was pretty decent was the custard bun. Others were pretty bad and bland and end of throwing them away. I just want some good Asian baked goods! Guess I gotta make another trip out to Cali....
3,"This place is awesome. Yet, I do have 2 complaints. 1. The owner is kind of rude. 2. I know theu are not a hookah lounge, which is why this fomplaint was not calculated into my rating, but their hookahs are not very good. Other than that, the coffee and the food are amazing. If the owner could be nice, they would get a 5."
2,"I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't wow me.  It was ok.  I would come here again if I was on the east side of town, but it certainly isn't a place I would shout about from the top of a mountain (kudos if you got the Ron Burgundy reference).\n\nI came here with a party of 10 at 8:00 on a Saturday night.  They were able to seat us within 10 minutes, which pleasantly surprised me.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  Their promptness was a definite plus for me.\n\nNow let's talk sushi.  I got the all you can eat, which is only $23.95 and basically pays for itself if you order two rolls.  Nice price, and the AYCE includes appetizers and desserts, which was also surprising to me.  However, if you do not get the AYCE, you will be very dismayed by some of the a la carte selections and pricing.  For example, seaweed salad is $4.00, but it comes in a bowl about the size of a soy sauce holder.  Also, mochi ice cream is $3.00 for two tiny pieces!\n\nFor nigiri sushi, I sampled red snapper, scallop, and halibut.  Red snapper is usually my most favorite because there is usually a citrusy sauce they put on it, but alas, this red snapper was bone dry...and a little too warm for my  liking.  In fact, I felt like all of the nigiri could have been a little cooler.\n\nFor rolls, I tried the caterpillar, double salmon, deep fried mussels, and son of the beach.  I was a little disappointed with the rolls because the caterpillar and double salmon were extremely dry, and the deep fried mussels and son of the beach were way overly sauced.  There is no middle ground at Yama.  However, another plus to this place is that you can order half rolls to try and see if you will like them.\n\nLike I said...it was OK and I would give them a try again."
4,"Read any other review... there is nothing but praise for Jennifer. Owner of Celebrity Skin, she knows her stuff and is absolutely amazing. She is great at what she does, is thorough, honest, gives great advice, and truly cares about her clients. She has recommended some things to me that have helped my skin, and have helped in other walks of life as well. I bow down to Jennifer for helping my skin drastically improve! \nIf you have acne problems... especially if they are hormonal, don't waste another second and run to Jennifer!!! If you have any other skin issues, or simply want a great microdermabrasion, extractions, dermaplaning, oxygenation or any other treatment... you cannot go wrong with Jennifer.\n\nJennifer is the best!"
1,"Okay, its obviously not for the food. The waffles are okay. \n\nThe reason you go is that its an art project, that could either be really entertaining, or really lame. This place has very charming and beaming CMU students working to promote art, waffles, life, and talk shows. its an interesting gig, which you will leave very quickly, or stay when you are drunk to free style rap or talk about your problems. Go when you are drunk, but remember you are on camera. Immortalized."
2,"Good selection for a Las Vegas buffet - quiet environment and good views of the pool area.\n\nBreakfast selections were awesome - meats, breads, steak (yeah) and exotic fruits.\n\nA little pricey for a Vegas buffet"
3,"I love going to Papago Park, or as the locals call it, hole in the rock! I started coming here back in 1995. During 1997-1999 I used to just go solo in the mornings and hike up to the hole and watch the sunrise over the valley. I found it quite comforting. I then moved away from AZ a short time later for a 13 year period and was stuck in the DC area.I have recently returned 'home' and took my now 12 year old son to visit, and it still was as awesome as I remembered it. Now I will visit often to spectate and to ride the mountain biking trails I hear they have there."
2,"Stopped in for a casual dinner last night and ordered the calamari to start ($8) it was coated in a peanut slaw eh wasn't quite my thing. I m not into foods overly sauced. I would pick something diff next time. I opted for the Arcadia salad- mixed greens with cranberries and pecans with a citrus vinaigrette. I added chix for protein. It was very clean, fresh and exactly what I wanted. The menu is simple from pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads. i would go back and check it out again but wouldn't recc to drive here if you dint live in the neighborhood."
2,"The food here is delicious! I have been to chedder's in other locations but I was new to this location. I met my boyfriend here when he got off work. It took them a few minutes to seat us, but that was expected seeing as it was right at dinner time. They seated us in the back of the restaurant and my boyfriend and I both noticed an awful smell. I think something in the dining room may have soured. Other then the smell it was a great experience with yummy good and excellent service."
2,"So I was here the other night to watch a friend of a friend's band play. I saw three different bands and all were really good! I was quite impressed actually at the talent they all seemed to posses. The crowd was very laid back and very mixed. No snobbery or bitchiness in sight! It was great!\nThe bar itself is in a bad location. Not bad like its unsafe or anything. But bad like its completely NOT visible from any main street. Its tucked back in this little strip of office buildings. The bar is in the front of the space its in the the music area is attached to that in like a massive garage/storage space.\nThe beer was good. I had the Red. Now the reason I gave this three stars is that it is named Old World BREWERY. I definitely expected more, but they only had 5 beers to choose from. \nWait, no...they only had 5 beers on the menu. They were out of 3 of them. This place is good enough though that I am willing to give it another shot."
0,"I was going to buy something for my wife in this LV, but one sales representative was extremely rude to us. Stepped out for another LV immediately."
3,Enjoyed the ham hash & duck egg I had in here a few weeks ago & the menu's less pricey than you'd maybe expect for Stockbridge. We had to ask for the bill twice and then eventually go in to get it & pay but that seemed to be down to them having one too few staff on for the amount of customers in that afternoon. Given that the service up to that point was good and the toilets etc. all in good order I'm happy to give the benefit of the doubt.
4,"Phenomenal!  This is hands down the best barbeque in Las Vegas.  The real deal!\n\nWe ordered, didn't have to wait for very long, and really enjoyed our meal. I had pulled pork and brisket duo, and it did not disappoint.  Sauce on the table went to good use.  My husband had an all you can eat with ribs that fell right off the bone.  He also tried shrimp and rib tips, which he said were terrific.  Hushpuppies were seasoned to perfection and the sides were all delish!!\n\nDefinitely adding this to our list of regular stops!  And check in for a dessert, the banana pudding was awesome."
4,"I recently moved here from the Seattle area and found the Las Vegas coffee scene disappointing/nonexistent. The  tables at the Starbucks near my apartment here seem to be a gathering place for the deranged and homeless. Anyway, I am very happy to have been showed Sambalatte. I love the atmosphere, and of course, the signature Nutella Latt\u00e9. I am a straight black coffee kind of person, so I thought the latte would be too sweet, but lo and behold, it's just perfect."
4,Recently got my wheels done and Juan did an outstanding job! Thank you for your attention to detail...
1,"I have definitely been to better diners.  The decor was cute and the place was clean.  During the lunch hour on a Sunday, I was surprised to see only 2 tables taken.  The service was good, our waitress was friendly.  The menu was too \""busy\"" for my personal liking.  We got burgers (I had the bacon and cheddar cheese) and a grilled cheese sandwich for the little one.  I lost all hope for this place when we got our food.  Our burgers were far from \""fresh, handmade\""....they were obviously the frozen patties that I can buy at the grocery store.  The bacon and cheese were good but the lettuce and tomato were wilted and warm.  I have no idea what their \""special sauce\"" was made of, but it was the nastiest thing ever.  They mayo was sour.  Now, the bun was fabulous but everything else was a joke.  And the prices.....for what you get, definitely over priced.  Even the grilled cheese was gross.  Let me just say, it's hard to mess up a burger and grilled cheese, but I'd rather go to Burger King than eat here again."
1,"So I have been here more than a few times and really loved coming here but an experience today just ruined it and how I feel about Harrahs hotel chain. I was at the pool, texting on my phone when some guy started splashing water at my phone. I couldn't figure out why, told him to cut it out and he did it again. I assumed he was drunk and went and got security. Security came and said everyone would need to leave as it was policy so in I obliged him and left. An hour later I came back with my family to retrieve something we left behind and low and behold, we see the people still there AND the security guard who supposedly asked them to leave, freak dancing with them. Yes. I have the video. To make matters worse, I reported to security and the manager said that the other party had accused me of photographing them and that excised their reason for them destructing my property. This did not occur. I volunteered my phone to security to review the images me he declined, saying I could have deleted the images beforehand, which wouldn't make sense as this was the first I had heard of this. I was more angry as to how security deflected blame and did not uphold policy. Security could have showed more diplomacy as well. also, I suspect a form discrimination took place  but I'll leave it personal but it left me humiliated and ashamed. I do not recommend harrahs chain to anyone. :("
2,Good course.  I would guess your satisfaction will be tied to the price you pay.  It's a little nicer than Angel Park but it's greens could be in better condition.
1,"I just don't understand how this isn't a rip off of Potbellys (of course it could be that Potbellys ripped off them). Traffic Jam = A Wreck. Same thing. Even the hot peppers same thing.\n\nAlso, the bread disappointed me. It was dry, cracky, and cut the inside of my mouth (don't you hate when bread does that and leaves the top of your mouth raw?)."
3,"Being my first links course, I really didn't know what to expect when I got here. Driving up to the large main gate and castle looking clubhouse, I couldn't help but chuckle.... only in Vegas. After a quick check in and some great breakfast at the bar, I set to tee off. Mind you, I am not a great golfer but I still enjoyed playing this course quite a bit. I played with someone from the UK who has actually played many of the links courses Royal Links emulates. He said many of the holes are just about spot on and they did a great job with recreating some of the \""best links holes in golf.\"" \n\nMy one tip about this course for those who have never played a links course before is to keep an eye on all your shots. Yes, I know this is golf and you should always do that. On this course though, you will always loose track of your ball because it will roll down a hill or behind a huge trap you do not see when you tee off. Also, be careful driving the cart on the course as there are many pot bunkers that are big enough to swallow your golf cart whole if you don't pay attention."
1,"Took my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned, when I picked it up I had to wait a really long time which was petty absurd because I was the only one there and they had 3 employees behind the counter but only 1 doing work. The price was reasonable but when my bf put his suit on, he noticed they had written his name in sharpie inside all the pieces - even the back of the tie. Even though the markings weren't visible, it was sill irritating. \n\nWe found a really awesome dry cleaner (Runners) which was always reasonable, the owner (or manager) was always friendly and remembered your face and name. We did a lot of business here but sadly the Greenfield location closed. \n\nFooters has so many locations in Pittsburgh in convenient locations but it is definitely worth seeking out some other place."
4,"This is one of the best places to eat... Bar food ... Great French onion soup.. The best ever try it....perogies again great ...,wings ok ..."
4,"What a find!  Been searching for a great east coast-style pizza since moving to the east valley in 2011 and we've found it in Nicantoni's.  Been past the place a thousand times but because the center is so dilapidated we've never felt compelled to go in.  Our BAD...this little pizzeria is truly authentic and amazing!  We loved the pizza and loved the sausage rolls,  Don't let the dreary exterior of the center fool you...this place is for real."
3,"I really enjoyed this place, had my son with me so he absolutely loved this place t.v's all over playing non-stop sports.  the variety of wings is great and the prices are pretty good as well.  This was really just a fun spot to hang out and eat wings."
2,"The selection of music, books, and movies is great. However, don't plan on making any money on trade-ins."
4,"Overall, this is the best food I've had in Charlotte, which I know doesn't say much, but it's also some of the best food I've ever had, anywhere. \n\nAtmosphere: \nThis place has an ever so slightly upscale appearance, but down to earth enough that you feel comfortable dressed down. Very open and airy. Classy enough for an anniversary date, comfortable enough for a casual dinner with friends. \n\nService: \nWe've had excellent service here. Slightly pushy with suggesting things, which is fine, just not my favorite style of service. Being vegetarian it's always a drag to hear the waitress rave on and on and suggest we try some braised venison or the pork chops that fall off the bone. Perhaps ask of any dietary restrictions before rambling on about something that sounds disgusting or is off limits to a patron.\n\nFood: \nThis is the thing about the food: The flavors are complex in a perfect way. It's how you'd expect gourmet food to taste. There are layers of flavor that you can't place, but that all work well together and create some sort of symphony in your mouth. And this applies to everything, even the little apple pastries that look like they'd be boring are a surprise of complex flavors. Give everything a try, you'll likely be surprised. I truly admire chefs who can accomplish this. \n\nCost:\nIt's expensive, no question. Brunch is $18/plate. It's not outrageous, especially considering the quality, but it's not something you're going to do every week or even every month. But it's absolutely worth it when you do.\n\nCelebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: \nGordon Ramsey. I think it might be the only place in the world he wouldn't have a seizure over the quality of the food. \n\nHalf hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: \nIf you could just make bullets out of everything on the buffet and gun me down in the face, I'd die happy."
4,"I came here today for 2 things. One I had bought an item in Mass. and wanted to get it hemmed and here in the Valley and two, I had called the day before about a pant that on line and all the other stores were out of.   \nA lovely girl named Alexis helped me on the phone.\nAfter a short time on hold she came back to say yes, the pants in my size and the color I wanted were there. She put them on hold for me until closing the next night. So when I arrived the pants were on hold with my name as promised and they were a perfect fit. Secondly, a lady named Jan marked my pants and pinned them so they could be hemmed.\n Everyone at this store is so helpful and friendly . It is such a pleasure.\n Now I have not been into this store at the Scottsdale mall since they moved the location.\nThe store is beautiful, laid out very nicely. Separate rooms with different Ideas in each. This store carries both men and women clothes, shoes , and accessories.\n It is a very shiny store. Spotlessly clean and everyone is so fabulous in this location.   I think that the Chandler Mall store could learn a little from this place.\n My Items were nicely wrapped in tissue, and I had brought a bag with me that they gladly used. \nVery lovely experience. I will be back."
4,"I came into Sauceman's with a generous BOGO coupon (up to $15 in value) and a friend. I say generous because 80% of their menu is under $10, with only 1 or 2 items even breaking past $15. So, needless to say, this place was cheap.\n\nI purchased the $12 chicken and ribs platter. You get a chicken breast and wing along with 1/3 a rack of ribs (or a \""rib tickler\"" as I believe they call it). You also get a large portion of fries, 2 sugar biscuits, and the choice of an additional side. I order the baked beans. My friend purchased the $8 or $9 steak sandwich, which came with the choice of a side (she ordered fries) and whatever toppings you wanted on the sandwich.\n\nThe amount of food for the price was absolutely incredible. My platter was literally served on a platter and was only $12. The chicken was a small piece, but the breast was surprisingly meaty. It was very tender and juicy and covered in their delicious BBQ. The ribs were a little bit on the dry side. They were certainly not falling off the bone and they required a little extra BBQ, but they were by no means bad. Again, for the price, they were awesome. The baked beans were very very tasty. They were made with their BBQ and almost had a sweet chili taste to them. I'm not normally a baked beans fan, but I devoured these. The french fries were french fries, but in a massive portion... They were basically a restaurant version of McDonald's fries, which is not a bad thing. The sugar biscuits were the same thing that you find at Chinese buffets, but they were much fresher then you'd find at any buffet. \n\nAll together, I was very pleased with Sauceman's. They serve cheaper restaurant quality food, but in a Cook Out or Penguin style setting. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you at your seat. You refill your drinks yourself and when you are done, they clear your table for you. They seem to cater to carry out a lot, but they have a small amount of inside seating for you to dine in at. \n\nAt the price, I couldn't help but give this place 5 stars."
1,"The staff is very friendly at this location and I appreciate that. The food is hot and fast. All that aside, I won't be going back Waffle House. They don't believe in butter, instead it's a butter spread. What's that about? Oh, now you wanna cut calories. The white bread toast was stale. But this is was took the cake....my bacon was burnt! I could have overlooked the \""butter\"" and the stale bread until you burned my bacon. Oh no you didn't!"
1,"Searching for decent Mexican food in Charlotte is like looking for Big Foot.  Just when you think you spotted him, he disappears.  \n\nPhat's is a burrito \""get it and go\"" type place.  Not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'll get the major downer out of the way first, their chips and guacamole is pretty disappointing.  I've had better chips from Tostitos.  As a matter of fact, I think they were tricolor Tostitos.  The burritos are fair.  Not good or great - fair.  \n\nThey \""almost\"" have a dining room but that's beside the point.  If the food warranted it, I would come here every week.  It's a decent neighborhood spot that I will probably try again if I'm in the area but there's absolutely no reason to go out of my way to trek here on a regular basis.  I really don't understand five stars for a mediocre burrito and brown guacamole.  But if you come here with low expectations you just might like it."
2,"This place is squeaky clean, the rooms are OK, quiet ambience, nice deck, free WiFi...but beware of the janitor, I am talking about the Latino-looking guy, he's kind of a perv...I was recently staying there with a friend, we put the \""do not disturb\"" sign on the door, yet he had the gall to open the door \""by mistake\"" while my friend and I were playing in bed (not exactly Scrabble). He apologized and shamelessly showed to us his boner sticking out of his shorts. He loves to pass by the shower whenever a guest is using it (it has no doors), casually, sometimes with a broom in his hand as if he were cleaning. I understand this is a gay B&B, and that the sun deck is clothing-optional but even gay guests in a gay B&B need and want privacy, especially when they are in the room. I hope the owner reads  this review and take some actions to stop this from happening, it's really annoying.  In addition, one of the owners is a real jerk, pompous, arrogant ass, especially when taking reservations over the phone. Other than that it's a decent place to stay and it is conveniently located near the Gay Village and Metro Berri-UQAM"
4,"I love this store. Malandrino dresses are classics.  I love the bright colors and the weight of the fabrics. The stitching is impeccable and the prices are far less here than in a boutique or any department like store.  Some dresses are priced at 50+% off. That is amazing. I wish I had pictures of the showroom. The store seems so empty but really, everything is just kept so neat and clean. It's always a nice trip to the Malandrino shoppe.  The sales associate didn't talk much but I think part of the reason for that is that the dresses and other items just sell themselves. It really is about the name and the quality. You wouldn't be disappointed."
0,This was the worst del taco ever! The chips in the nachos were totally stale. The fries were cold and the service was VERY mediocre! Being from out of town and getting such poor food was SO DISAPPOINTING!
4,I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. We had a blast enjoying the food and the view of the entire city. One of the best venues in Vegas. \n\nENTREE:\nI ordered SALMON for entree and it was very fresh and tasty. About $40 with some side veggies and mushroom. My boyfriend ordered the RIB-EYE : the sauce was amazing and the quality of the beef was very good as well.\n\nDESSERT:\nthey have the special DESSERT TRIO for only $8. i would recommend the banana bread pudding the raspberry chocolate creme brulee. \n\nFUN:\n1.go up to the observation deck at the stratosphere (Which alone costs $16) to see people do sky jumping. \n2.Photographers will take photos of you at the restaurant. The quality is great and we got our picture for about $22 (not too bad! ) wear something nice if you want to have a picture with your significant other on a romantic date! :D
3,"I really like The Potting Shed. It's quirky and rustic and pulls off the shed theme well. \n\nThe staff are really lovely- even when it was busy and their till wasn't working, an obviously stressful and really inconvenient situation. Extra points for customer service!\n\nSome people say it's pretty pricey, but they do excellent deals like lunch for \u00a35 or coffee and cake for \u00a33!!! And it's a pretty decent slice of cake you get. The options were a little limited, but hey sometimes the choice of chocolate and red velvet is tough enough."
0,This place sucks. They have 99cent store stuff selling for 5x the price lol save your time and go anywhere else
0,"A) The place was so dimly lit I couldn't even see to the other side of the restaurant. \n\nB) They skimped on the Italian vinaigrette on the salad, but I feel like they were doing me a favor because what I did have on my salad wasn't very tasty. The bread was okay, but nothing to write home about. The oil used for dipping the bread into tasted like the stuff you get in gallon jugs at Costco/Sam's Club.\n\nC) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's, so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right, I don't trust you to do anything else right either). The meatballs weren't bad, but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs. The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store. My father and I both agreed that it tasted nearly-identical to the Michelina's frozen spaghetti dinners you spend less than $1 for at the grocery store. \n\nSummary: I won't be going back on my own accord."
1,Had steak hoagie. Was ok nothing special. Service was ok. We also ordered pizza....whoa big mistake..  1 notch above cardboard.
1,"This is a really cool looking restaurant, and it seems that someone spent a lot of time picking out bar stools, lighting fixtures, counter tops and flooring. I would rather have seen the same attention to detail in the food and the service, but that's just me. \n\nI sat in the downstairs bar and found the waitress to be scarce when my glass was empty and stopping by a couple of times just after she brought the drink, I will say that she seemed new and a little nervous so maybe it's not the norm. \n\nAs for the food, I found the carpaccio with the red cabbage to be unique but disappointing. The calamari itself was nothing special although the sauce it was served with was interesting (in a good way). \n\nI am assuming based on the decor this place will have a decent crowd so if I find myself back there I will sit AT the bar and grab a bite elsewhere."
4,"Found Elite Audio and Customs on Yelp after researching and visiting a couple of other shops in town.  Visited Elite, met Mo and explained what I was looking for.  I'm  sure he could tell I was not well versed in car audio, but he took his time, a lot of time, to explain the different options based on what My needs were.  In short, he recommended a very reasonably priced set up, wrote down the quote with model/name of equipment and said it was valid when ever I was ready, WOW.  No pressure, no up-selling, just very straight forward based on information I provided. Called about 1week later, told Mo I was ready and he got me scheduled in just a couple of days.  Took all of about 2.5 hours, as promised, and all I can say about the end result is CRAZZY.  The subs and amp absolutely made my truck (2014 Ram) sound like a rolling theater.  After the install, Mo and the instal guy (Derick) walked me though the instal from under the hood to the cab and explained all the \""how to stuff\"".  Truly can't say enough about the experience , other than we will be bringing my wife's 2014 Z in for similar upgrades. Not often you get a chance to say something positive about service these days.   \n\nSo, to Mo and your team, THANK YOU.  \n\nLJ AND KJ"
4,"Delish! I just had the fried rice (take home) for breakfast and I could go for seconds quaint and calming atmosphere, very friendly staff, all food made to order, and please try the fried chicken app. The ramen my fiend created as absolutely delishious as well, Im really looking forward to my next visit"
4,"This location is very great. Employees are nice, place is nice and clean, and I love their ice cream! The burgers are a little greasy but taste great. I definitely will be coming back!"
0,"My bf was visting from Colorado Springs and we were in the mood for seafood, yeah in Phoenix, but we decided to try this place anyway. What were we thinking? There was nothing wrong with service, the food was terrible. It's definitely not what you expect when you look the price, really pricey. We shared oysters for the appetizer. I ordered a clam chowder. It was fine, not outstanding but edible. My bf ordered a ceasar salad, the plate was warm, the romaine was wilted. He is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back. I ordered the scallops which were ok, a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto. It was all too dry, I had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down. It sat like a lump in my stomach, leaving no room for desert. My bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup. It was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water. The taste? None, it was tasteless and watered down, no butter, no white wine, nothing to make it taste good. The herbs did nothing for the dish.\nWould I go back to give it a second chance, nah, not for the price. The most unsatisfying place I have ever eaten."
0,"Where to start? My eggs Benedict were great. Now, for the problems. Dirty dishes. Had to ask several times for water or coffee refills. Waitress had us passing stuff to others instead of walking around the table. O.j. Tasted like it had grapefruit juice mixed in or was watered down. Fresh fruit was unripe and/or mushy. Bacon was thin, precooked and tasteless. French toast advertised as brioche but it was regular bread. Annoying burnt toast smell the whole time. Avoid."
3,"Ok, I admit it: I love having my teeth cleaned. There's nothing like running the tip of your tongue over clean, smooth and fresh teeth. So, you can imagine my excitement when I decided to go in for my quarterly cleaning. \n\nHaving received a voucher in the mail, I figured 25$ off a service was enough of a draw to get me in. Granted, this voucher wasn't mine - it was for the previous occupant of my apartment. But, hell, the dental office didn't know that. \""A friend gave it to me,\"" I told them when I presented it proudly at 8 a.m. one morning. I was then told that's for birthdays only, and when my birthday comes around, I'll get mine to use. Oh. Well, I was already there, so I might as well stay - without the voucher even. Good thing my dental insurance covered the cleaning. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of waiting, I'm escorted back to a regular, average-sized dental office. You know, all decked out with the typical dental chair and machinery. That's when I'm told that the X-rays I emailed weren't going to be enough, so they had to re-take 'em. WTF. Ugh. \n\nFirst off, I hate stuff being stuck in my mouth. It pinches my cheeks and hurts. So, when the dental hygienist said, \""You have a really small mouth,\"" I wasn't surprised. It wasn't the first time I heard it. Nor was it the first time I had ever had X-rays taken. Hell, I got 8 beautiful veneers last year. You don't get those overnight. That's one helluva process, which includes way too many impressions (translation: gooey-ness and mouth pieces stuck in your mouth for at least a minute.) \n\nSo, I sucked it up. It had to be done. It was the means to an end, I told myself. Besides, my dental insurance should cover it. \n\nThat's when I was told they then had to measure my gums. An assistant was called in and the poking and counting began. I didn't mind, but it was more of my time devoted to routine practice... and not the cleaning I had been dreaming of. Oh, sweet cleaning, why were you playing hard to get?!?\n\nImagine my frustration when, after the Gum \""stuff\"" and X-rays were taken (a few re-taken due to bad shots), I then had to have my mandatory consultation with the dentist. I guess he, himself, had to poke and prod around my gums and teeth. That's when he wanted to talk about replacing a couple caps and taking care of a cavity I have. Uhm, now? All I wanted was a cleaning. Seriously. \n\nPlus, he heard that a friend referred me. \""What friend?\"" He asked. \""Uh, Christy.\"" I lied. \""Christy who? I only ask because I like to thank my patients when they refer their friends.\"" I was cracking up inside. Of course he did. \""I don't know,\"" I said, \""I don't really know her that well.\""\n\nThat's when I checked the time. It was close to 10 and I had a meeting. Was this really happening? I told them I had to get going because of work. Ok, so maybe I didn't look like the young professional I am when I'm sitting in a dentist chair with flip-flops, jeans and an old t-shirt on. Not to mention my hair was haphazard in a pony-tail and my face was free of make-up. Who was I trying to impress anyway? \n\nBottom line, I had to get going. The friendly hygienist (who, turns out, is from Michigan) said the cleaning would take about 20 minutes. I let my office know I was running behind; then, I relaxed into the dentist's chair.  Time for the cleaning! \n\nAh, the cleaning... bliss... pleasure... oh, sweet jesus...\n\nThen, ugh. Fluoride. I was told I couldn't eat or drink or rinse for 2 hours. WTF. My stomach rumbled in anger. \n\nAfterwards, I was given the usual bag of goodies. Upon check-out, the woman at the desk had already drafted up the coverage and cost for the procedures the dentist said I needed to get done. Cool. That's helpful, I thought. Right on. But then she wanted to schedule the appointment. \""I need to check my schedule,\"" I said. She looked surprised again, as if to say, \""Oh, you work?\"" Yes, g'dammit, I work!  After telling her about 2-3 times that I would have to get back to her, she finally let me go. \n\nThat's when I sped out of the parking lot with 15 minutes to run home, change (no time for a shower, grr!) and get my arse to work. I hate-hate-hate running late. I didn't know that a routine cleaning scheduled at 8 a.m. would take 2 hours. \n\nSo, why the 4 stars? I can't knock how thorough this office is. I just wish they would have told me ahead of time, then, the working gal I am, I would not have scheduled an important meeting that morning. I would have saved it for the afternoon, esp. since I had to lead a meeting on an empty stomach with Fluoride breath. Meh."
1,"I wish I didn't have to do this, but after last night I cannot have my name attached to a 4-star review of this place. It is a personal pride issue. \n\nI haven't lived in Tempe for about a year now so the last time I was here was at least before October 2008.  My boyfriend and I decided to go back last night after watching Man V. Food Austin and getting a serious craving for BBQ. I checked the menu online and noticed it had changed quite a bit. A lot cheaper and lot less variety items. But they still had the deviled eggs (that used to be AWESOME) so I figured it was probably owned by the same people, they just are now catering more to the ASU Crowd.  \n\nI do not see HOW this could be under the same ownership as it was a year ago. The quality of food dropped TREMENDOUSLY. We decided to split a sampler, which consisted of BBQ chicken, pork, brisket, and 2 ribs. What came out was 2 okay ribs, 3 piles of cold shredded meat, all of which tasted very similar, that each had a drizzle of generic bbq sauce on top, and weird, not-good-at-all bun. \n\nThe \""Yam Planks\"" were soggy and overseasoned. The wings were bearable, but no better than any sports bar. Plus, they were the crispy, breaded kind like hooter wings, which I'm not a huge fan of. The only good part of the night was the $3.00 32 OZ Pitchers. \n\nI feel kinda bad updating, because the owner seems really nice, and our crappy BBQ platter was comped (we didn't even complain about it, she must have just known it was bad) but I have to because of how much I raved about this place before and how much it has changed."
0,"Their affiliation with gorilla, a group that plays the game of bands selling tickets to play, is why they get one star.  The ticket game is just to rip off bands who simply want to play.  They could instead grow a reputation of being a venue that attracts quality talent and then the audience will come.  Instead they go the low quality route.  Not impressed."
1,"Where there for a glass of wine around 10 pm. We ordered oysters. We saw the food that was served at the other tables; smelled good, looked good just like you would expect it to be when going through the menu. The place is nice too. Nice location  Everything was pushing us to reserve for this place for our next date night. But... service sucked. Too bad. I'll try it again as I always give a second chance"
3,"I love that NY NY's food court isn't set up like a typical food court. I usually get the pizza or the sausage from other restaurants but on this trip I decided to go into Greenberg's Deli. Second sandwich of the day but hey, it was totally worth it. The meats for the hot sandwiches were freshly sliced. The wheat bread was good and I'm glad we got potato salad instead of the chips. It's a hearty meal that you can definitely share with a friend. I'll be back!"
4,"MOTHER OF JESUS I THINK I JUST CREAMED MYSELF.\n\nNo seriously, it's that good.\n\nWhenever an establishment has several hundred reviews, and averages 4.5 stars, you can bet that their shit is pretty good.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't disappoint.\n\nThere is nothing that I can write in my review that other Yelpers haven't already told you.  The food is fucking good.  It's fucking filling.  And it's fucking cheap.  That's like the Yelper dream trifecta.  So instead of sitting on your iPhone, go now, and thank me later.\n\nWarning: I'm part Mexican.  Which means that I fit in well in this part of Las Vegas.  This is NOT your Las Vegas strip by the Bellagio type of crowd.  This is your recently immigrated type of crowd.  So if you're not comfortable amongst ethnic folks, then you might want to hit up the location on the strip."
3,"four stars for their buffet and the greatest dessert bar ive seen. however, I have not yet patroned the Wynn hotel and I've heard that one puts this buffet to shaaaaaaaame so we shall see!\n\ncrab legs crab legs crab legs alone deserves four stars."
2,"We had many issues with finding the correct door for my vehicle. We were a cash paying customer and were quoted an amount, but they called us back later, once our vehicle was already there, to tell us that our door is discontinued and that they'd have to find one, so it would cost more than initially stated. THEN, we were called and the company that they got the door from, had sent them the wrong door. Of course the door that was needed was going to cost even more. \n\nI don't understand body collision shops to be honest, but I would think that somehow they would have wanted the customer satisfaction? they could have eaten the cost once they realized that they screwed up? we were told that there was going to be no breaks in the cost, because the laborers were the ones suffering. I don't quite understand that logic because they'd be doing the same amount of labor regardless of what door it was being replaced, no? but like I said, I don't fully understand.\n\nBoooo to the company who sent the wrong door, I guess.\n\nMy vehicle is fixed and the job is satisfactory, except for one teeny thing-my back door squeaks when its being opened and closed. Does not affect the looks or function of the door, just a minor annoyance that did not occur before it was in the shop.\n\n*quote was better than other shops in the same area"
0,"Bad experience in 5 starts Bellagio hotel , they gave me twice wrong rooms type , what's a 5 start hotel's service like this ,the customers service like shit and really really bad , I won't come Bellagio anymore even though here have nice water show , that's cant cover they bad service , don't come here , u might get 0 stars service in 5 starts hotel"
1,"Maybe I'm just a crazy New Englander, but this place was nothing special...\n\nFirst of all, they serve stale bread and some sort of roasted red pepper spread at your table.  Sorry, but it just doesn't go...\n\nInside is super loud...they've got speakers all over the place and it's not a big restaurant.  Live music is a nice thought, but it's literally deafening. \n\nFood is just not good.  Tacos were bland.  Table side guacamole has a \""kitchen sink\"" recipe and uses avacados that aren't even ripe.  Also had a vegetarian dish that was just roasted veggies covered with a ton of cheese.  \n\nService was not good either.  Waiter forgot what we ordered (writing stuff down would be OK by me...) and stuff came out slow.  \n\nDefinitely wouldnt go back..."
2,"First let me say the food at 5Church was great. We tried the hummus appetizer and the pork belly appetizer, and they were both very tasty. The salmon and chicken entrees were also very delicious. However, the atmosphere wasn't really my style. We're in our mid-30s, and most of the diners were in their early 20s; the girls were decked out in 5 inch stilletos and micro minis and the guys were in suits. The decor is very modern, and the music felt like house music with some serious bass. As much as I loved the food, I felt really old! Looks like it's definitely a great new hotspot in uptown... I may just need to stick to lunch."
3,"Just had a Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich for lunch there.  Hot Damn, that was some fine eating!\n\nI think I'll come back again, and again, and again.  BTW - breakfast is now served until 2:00pm on the weekends (10:30am during the week)  \nThey open at 6:00am M-F and 7:00am on the weekends\n\nParking is very tight for the lunchtime crowd, so try to be there NLT that 11:40am or you may not get a spot since there's more restaurants in that plaza than places to park! If you're just popping in to pick up a to-go order, this won't be an issue since they have the some to-go parking in front of the door."

1,"The Bold Roost is still new, so perhaps in a month or so of their establishment the kinks in their system will be ironed out.\n\nFor me, what I took into consideration with this 2 star ranking was the drink, decor, and customer service.\n\nDrink: I got a cookies and cream smoothie (it was something like that, I can't remember the exact name anymore), and was pleasantly surprised at the sweet taste, not over bearingly sweet. \ncons: chocolate chunks were not blended well, I felt like i was eating crumbled chocolate rather than having a chocolate blended drink. Secondly, cost of the drink was over $4, and the drink very extremely small for that price! \n\nDecor: as I said, I understand that this cafe is new, and I can see the concept they are going for with their local art hanging on the wall, however, the decor looked like everything was just thrown together. All the art was clustered in one corner, there may have actually been too many chairs and tables because the sitting area felt crowded (and I was the only one there at the time!). so it wasn't as cozy as a one would want from a family run cafe.\n\nLastly, Customer service: the service was very good. the cashier was nice with his drink recommendation and this was very pleasing :)\n\nHopefully the Bold Roost will have a better outcome since I always like to give a place a second chance, but hopefully it doesnt empty my wallet for just one drink."
0,"This place is permanently CLOSED! We drove by tonight for dinner and the lights were off, doors were locked, open sign off and no one answered the phone. Not typical for a business on a Friday night. I'm bummed too because I was totally captivated by their yelp reviews!"
4,"ABC how i love thee.  You can never go wrong with this place.  If you're in Hawaii you'll see this store every block or so in Waikiki I kid you not!\n\nAs we stayed in Paris we needed to go to a drugstore or liquor store stat!  Walgreen's was out of the question and wasn't within walking distance.  We talked to one on the staff members at Paris and he suggested ABC store at the Miracle Mile Shop located at Planet Hollywood Hotel.  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes one way (we walked) to get there on a Saturday evening.  We needed water and some drinks for our stay here.  There are two ABC stores in this mall.  We chose whatever was closest and ended up at the \""north\"" ABC location (suite 145).  This store was pretty big.  ABC had what we needed and got in and out of there fairly quickly.  Of course the pricing was skewed slightly higher than usual but we didn't care.  \n\nYou can even pick up some hawaiian souvenirs if you're up for it.  Macadamia nuts, kona coffee, maui chips, etc. Yay for ABC!"
4,"I have stayed here twice. I loved it both times. The beach is one of a kind and amazing, it gets pretty packed so trying to find a seat can be hard. The service was great, at check in the man was very nice and told us what was going on in town that week. The room service is eh, but the room was very nice and really clean, I on the 23rd floor with an amazing view of the strip. I will be staying here again this summer!"
0,In all respects.. this place sucked. I really love thai food and I'm so tired of traveling to horizon and horizon for the best yellow curry. I'm tired of traveling to the slumps of downtown lv for the best tom kha and drunken noodles. It's sad that pei wei has the best crab wontons in town. What does a woman have to do to get good eats.\n\nAnyway. I ordered shrimp fried rice with tomatoes.... i guess the tomatoes were shy because i never had the pleasure of meeting nor eating them :( to top that off the rice was too moist like it was fresh rice..everybody knows the best fried rice starts with day old rice.\n\n The tom kha was sad no tomatoes or mushrooms.. red onions and dry chicken was on the menu. No wonder they were so generous.... I'm done with this.
3,The food is decent. We go here mainly because its close and they have a big game room for the kids. The kids have tons of fun every time we go here.
0,"This place was horrible! There are so many buffets in Vegas but not for this price. Payed less than $30 for 3 adults! But the food wasnt worth it, I felt sick right after. I love sushi, yeah it was gross. The rest of the food, just as bad. But the service was not good at all. My first plate was at the table until I left. There was 5 old dishes on our table. But the BEST part? We were seated in the back by the restroom and they would stand there just talking and sitting down doing NOTHING! food was bad and service was bad. Just spend a little more money and go somewhere else!"
2,"Margarita was not weak!  Hey you are at Margaritaville!!!  Yay me!\n\nMy husband & I started by sharing the crab & mushroom dip with bread.  It was cheesy & good on the bread!  Yum!\n\nThen we decided to share the Volcano nachos!  We are both eaters but could not finish it!  Glad we shared!\n\nIs it 5 star food?  No but it was enjoyable, filling and in a lively environment!  We were on vacation!!!\n\nEntertainment was guys (ship captain, pirate) on stilts and a girl in the lime green tank."
1,"No, No, No, say it ain't so! I love Gordon Ramsey.\n\nThis is just based on the service since we didn't even get a chance to try the food.  Walked in for early lunch on Saturday and restaurant wasn't even 1/2 full, yet no one including the hostess can find a table to put us. True we were a party of 9 but still!  The restaurant was HALF empty!!? wtf? And this IS VEGAS! Your whole staff stood there oblivious what to do.  \n\nStarting to wonder of these celebrity chef restaurants are actually worth the hype?? My impression is just another celebrity making a buck off their current fame.  Very disappointing. \n\nI'll still watch Hells Kitchen to see who ended up running this place."
0,"I also hate giving a bad review to anything downtown, because it's such an underated and underused community that's developing around my hood, and I want every new business to succeed.  However, I feel the disappointment still within me a day after my so called \""celebrity chef\"" meal.  This is in the top 5 worst meals I've ever paid for.  \nTo start, the hummus was served with store bought lavash, and it wasn't finished by 3 people, and that was not because of the size or lack of hunger, and all three of us love hummus.  The albacore on skewers was overcooked, dry, and served w a \""homemade\"" aoli, that to me tasted like Helman's with a bit of red pepper.  If the majority of the ingredients in a sauce are pre-made, it's not homemade.  That's like buying ceaser salad dressing at the store and adding some parmesan to it and calling it your homemade dressing.  weak.  Lastly the sirloin with chimichurri sauce was also overcooked to about medium well and flavorless other than a seemingly similarly made chimichurri sauce.  \nThis place is just half ass in general.  I put quite a bit more effort and thought into making a sack lunch.  Man, this is my first review on yelp, and i feel like an asshole cuz it's scathing, but I was that disapointed with this place that is trying to be something it is absolutely not.  \nOn a final note, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, though the \""celebrity chef\"" had not educated her on much more than maybe 2 items on the menu.  I hope that somehow, someway they can turn this place around, but as of now, the only thing worth going for is the free, crappy sangria."

0,"Service this morning was abysmal. I changed locations this morning, running late in hopes that the drive-thru would be more speedy. Yeah, right.\n\nThe line moved painstakingly slooooowwwww. When I got my coffee, it was barely 2/3 full, and the rest was all whipped cream. I ordered a Venti Vanilla Latte. I'm not going to pay five dollars for a cup full of whipped cream, I wanted the coffee. \n\nLast time I visit this location."
1,"We came here for brunch because it got such high Yelp reviews. We were disappointed. The decor was hideous. Ive never seen so many obnoxious colors in a carpet before. There was a hair in my drink. The server seemed kindof out there. The food was barely edible. My eggs tasted funny. My husband ordered a house specialty, some kind of waffle with bacon cooked in it. His syrup tasted like a bloody mary. Who puts such odd ingredients in maple syrup and doesnt tell you until it is dumped all over your food? Oh thats right. A place that makes their hostesses wear hot pink and has the most hideous decor Ive ever seen. There prices are high too. $60 for breakfast for two."
2,"The location is good, avenue is a few doors down making it easy to shop for Plus Sizes. \n There are many items and so much to choose from. The clearance section is pretty big. They accept coupons and the clerks are helpful. \n They can be pricey if its not on sale, if you are on a budget I'd hit avenue. If you want quality stay here. I just wish they carried bigger sizes than a 28 and more stretch knits."

4,"I love this Starbucks location above many others. I always get what I order, the drinks are consistent, and tasty. It's within walking distance for me, which is a huge plus.\n\nThe staff is usually very friendly as well. Yeah it's a bit pricey, but I know what I'm getting is going be done quick, and taste good."
3,"We'ver ordered out for delievery here twice(never eatten in the resturant itself). Both times though the food was really good..The capicolla sub though is a bit spicier then what we're used too but still great. We love the passion bread and well, we haven't even tried the pizza yet but the pasta is wonderful and I have to say their deserts are great too."
0,"Was here with a large group and perhaps my experience is not representative, but I would never go  back under any circumstances.\n\nWe had five tables in a semi-private room and it was nearly an hour before our salad courses were served and another long delay before entrees were served and dessert service was equally slow.  But slow wasn't all that was wrong with the service.  Table clearing was erratic, no one inquired about the food served and they seem more interested in telling stories than listening to what their patrons wanted.\n\nThe food sounds great on the menu, but don't count on what you get resembling the menu.  A salad with tomato and hearts of palm had 1 cherry tomato cut in half and a section of palm heart less than 1/2 inch cut into thin slices.  The rest was fancy lawn clipping in a vinegary dressing.\n\nThe steak au poivre tasted ok and the prep was fine, but the chicken breast with fingerlings was dreadful.  I could have used the chicken breast as a dessicant for a shipping container.  I only tasted the chocolate cake and it was completely without merit.   Enough - don't need to beat a dead horse (although it might have been better than the chicken)."
4,"If you enjoy old school Italian places, this is it. A throw back to the days of the Rat Pack, this place excels at food, service, and atmosphere. The dimly lit atmosphere, accordion player, and true Italian recipes make this place a winner."
0,"Horrible.  So disappointed.  The food was old and tasted like cafeteria food.  Even the crab legs tasted off.  I am one to always try something once always give it a second chance, but I'm breaking my own rule and saying STAY AWAY!!!!"
3,"Jimmy Buffett's Margartiaville is always on my to do list when I'm in Vegas and my most recent trip was no different.  My friend and I were partially hungover and I thought the Volcano Nachos would be a good way to start the day.  \n\nOn this given Saturday, we didn't have to wait for room at the bar and we immediately sat ourselves at the bar.  The cafe was steadily busy, but not overflowing with customers as you might expect during the late-night hour.  We went ahead and placed our order for the Volcano Nacho and I decided to try a frozen concoction by the name of Havanas and Bananas.  The frozen drink is made with Cruzan Dark Rum, Baileys, and Bols Crema de Banana and Island Oasis coconut mix.\n\nThe frozen drink was delicious and tasted like something off the Starbucks Frappachino menu rather than an alcoholic beverage.  The drink was flavorful, yet had a kick of rum that wasn't overpowering in anyway.  The volcano nachos arrived and were just as big as I remembered.  The appetizer can serve as a main entree or can be shared with two or three adults and still have leftovers.  \n\nThe volcano nachos are topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os, tomato and scallions.  Additionally, you can add grilled chicken or beef for an additional charge.  I tend to always go with grilled chicken and yet to try the beef topping.  The nacho plate represents everything Vegas food is about.  The nachos are overwhelming with flavor, spiciness, and size.  The nachos are simply delicious and leave you stuffed.  I can't recommend the nachos enough, especially if you're with a group of friends, as you can all share and dig in.\n\nI would give Margaritaville a full five stars, but I had a horrible experience a few summers ago.  The cafe was busy and I was forced to wait about 25-30 minutes for a spot to open at the bar.  Once I sat myself , I was carded and the girl behind the counter refused to serve me because she said the ID wasn't mine.  Granted, the picture was old and I had gained 100+ lbs, but there was still enough resemblance for me to be served everywhere else in Las Vegas.  Furthermore, she was rude about the whole ordeal and refused to call over a manager.  I was upset and called her a cunt and walked away.  The situation could of been handled better by both parties, but I consider it an isolated incident and sweep it under the rug."
0,"After reviewing the cupcakery reviews here on yelp, i decided to give it a try....\nWhile i was in line, a lady askes the server, are your cupcakes as good as sprinkles, and the obvious response was.... I think our cupcakes are better than sprinkles.  So at first my expectations were ehh... but after the comment, my taste buds were bubbling awaiting the red velvet... \nresults: the cupcakery does not hold a candle to sprinkles, nor to many other cup cake eateries here in Los Angeles.  For some strange reason, the cake was cold, from being in the fridge, instead of room temperature... Although the price is cheaper, but the package made me feel these cupcakes were bought at the local market, since they package it in the see through plastic containers. \nhighly disappointed!"
1,"I read some great reviews of this place and not being able to get a seat at some of the sports books at the larger casinos, the wife and I decided this would be the place to watch Sunday football and place bets.  It all started off so well but declined after the first round of NFL games.\n\nOur waitress Shane was awesome.  She made sure the TV in our area was on the game we wanted to watch and was prompt with drink orders and suggestions.  She was very friendly and helpful.  However, after the early games went off, things quickly got out of hand.\n\nFirst, the game of the week (Seahawks vs. Cowboys) was what 85% of the people were there to see.  Not only did they refuse to take 60 seconds to turn the channel, but by the time 1 of the 8 people in the area decided to do so (after many complaints) the game was already 12 minutes into the first quarter.  Then without any reasoning they changed all the TV's (38 total) to the Oakland/San Diego game and refused to change it back for another 5 minutes.\n\nAfter finally getting the game the majority of us were there to watch, the casino fire alarm went off for the entirety of the 2nd quarter and well into the 3rd.  We were told they had scheduled fire alarm maintenance.  Thanks!  Because what better time to test your system when your place is full of sports fans in a sports bar wanting to watch sports.\n\nThe only saving grace was a pretty good beer selection and a really awesome waitress.  Otherwise the bartenders and the guys in suits (floor managers I guess) were all worthless stooges who probably aren't qualified enough to work in the better casinos.  If you have no options on Sunday to check out games this place will work in a pinch, but watching in your room is probably a much better experience.  Unless you're a sadist, I'd stay away from Tag.  It's low rent, run by clueless people, and not worth the effort to spend your money there."
0,"I'm not a hater, I love to give a positive review when warranted.   Vegas is expensive and I'd rather send you elsewhere but here.  If you want to impress a date and they don't know quality sushi and they ain't paying the bill, then go here.\n\nIf you want below average and VERY expensive sushi.... Go here...  There's no doubt that the place looks very cool but I'm not here to get gouged with SMALL portions that barely have flavor.\n\nI've eaten here three times (on the company card) and I can't tell you how disappointed I was each time.  I had to eat here for work, and you all know food sometimes tastes a little better when you aren't paying for it.  That doesn't happen here at all...."
0,"this follow up comment from Jeff Hamra is absolutely not true.  I have had no feedback from Rolex after I offered proof and said I had receipts, emails, etc.  They never told me that this dealer had not sold me two used Rolex's.  I never heard from Rolex and in talking with another Rolex dealer and showing them the serial numbers they confirmed that these were an 11 year old and a 8 year old watch.  I never received updated warranty cards.  I am shocked that a dealer can get away with selling used watches as new - including paying current pricing."
3,"My husband and I had great seats (3rd row from the front) and we were able to see all of the performers up close.  KA is set up a little bit differently than all of the other Cirque De Soleil shows, this one had an actual story line.  Each seat has built in speakers so that you can hear the music.  The shadow puppets were a nice touch since that is not something I would have expected but it was done beautifully.  Not everything happens on stage, the performers also use the two sides of the theater for certain scenes.  I really enjoyed this show."
2,"Zushi is a pretty average Sushi joint. The first time I tried this place it was below average, as I'm pretty sure the ownership had just changed and service wasn't that great and the food wasn't all the impressive for the price. We did go back and had a way better experience and it was during happy hour so the prices were more reasonable. I have a few sushi place that I will always go to over Zushi but I wouldn't be opposed to coming back."
1,"I got this this Hotel from Hotwire. It's my first time in Vegas so it's kinda hard to decide where to stay. So bf and I decided to use hotwire that way we will be surprised as to what hotel we're gonna get. I've been to a lot of nice hotels. But my first time experience of hotel in Vegas weren't as nice as the rest of my vacations just because it's from hotwire they wont consider my 4pm late check out although they give me a 1pm check out since we checked in at 11pm. I was happy coz of the good reviews from YELP, some even got an upgrade so I signed up for their membership/rewards card thinking I will come back and stay at the Trump next month. But yeah they can't consider the 4pm late check out. Well Hello! it's Vegas and nightlife is what it is. Had to rush myself for check out the next day and left my souvenir in the room. Gladly we we're still having lunch in the area and we're able swing by the hotel to retrieve it from reception. Rooms are really nice, clean and odor and smoke-free. Noisy train passing by though! I didn't give it a 10 because toiletries are incomplete. At the poolside you will have to get up your lounge chair to order and wait at the H2Eau bar for your drinks since no server goes around that time. No help or assistance for assembling the umbrella. Me and two other guests had to do it ourselves and it's not easy.. A bit off the Strip. 25$ Resort fee."
2,"I felt like I was hot boxed at Piranha since so many people were smoking cigarettes. Coming from California, it was hard to get used to people smoking indoors. The ventilation was either not working or not very good because every breath I took was filled with smoke. I needed a gas mask.\n\nThe music was pretty good playing a good mix of older songs with remixes of newer songs. It was harder to dance in the beginning of the night since there were a ton of people. But as the night progressed, people started leaving and there was more and more room to move around and dance. But since it seemed the go to place, it attracts all different kinds of people and it get a little sketch. Also, the dungeon/dark atmosphere was interesting..."
1,The food is pretty decent  but the multiple times I've been in there the staff have hadhorrible attitudes. The food isn't worth it when you get treated like you are bothering the staff each time you order food
3,"Great neighborhood hideaway.  Ample portions.  Soups are always good.  Great comfort food. Service is fast and friendly.  The pot pie is so rich and creamy.  Specials every night, most under $10.  Meatloaf, chicken, or turkey and stuffing are tasty!"
3,"Whats more fun than eating some hot n juicy crawfish?!  For those messy eaters this is your heaven.  Add some juicy crawfish into their Hot n Juicy seasoning in spicy level and Cajun medium level and BAM you have a party in your mouth, and hands, and mouth and all over.  Yum.  I'd come back here next time I'm in Vegas and maybe I'll try to the other seafood goodness..  \n\nService is so-so but who cares if the food comes fast!"
2,"From an american point of view, It was like a gooey quesadilla with ham and cheese in it.  The french fries are spectacular.  I think Montreal just owns fries in general.  I need to go back to try the dessert crepes."
4,"We went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded. The Bar was busy but there was only two tables in the dining area. We were seated and served quickly, the waitress was quick, efficient and friendly. The place was good for kids because it was separated from the bar area by a wall, I am not sure how kid frinedly it would be at night with a full bar.  My 7 year old got the kids nachos, my wife got the pork tacos and I got the supreme tostada nachos. We all loved our food it was delicious. The pork taco's were the best we had ever had, the kids nachos were tasty and the cheese sauce it really good. The supreme nachos were excellent and slightly hot due to the fried jalapenos. The only complaint would be that the supreme nachos were a little smaller than I expected. My wife ordered a Mango Thai Basil Margarita and she said it was tasty and she enjoyed it. We all shared a Churro sundae and it was so good. We couldn't finish it all but we tried. It comes with chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauce with 4 churros. We had a great late lunch and it was well worth the trip to Fremont. We will definitely be back again!"
2,"The fries are the perfect combination of crisp and salty and, of course, they are served with Heinz ketchup. I enjoyed sipping on the Pious Monk Dunkel, but wish I had tried the Pumpkin Stout. The Chicken Sausage Sandwich had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but the kick was tampered by the aiolis that coated the soft sweet bun."
1,"Boyfriend and I came here on a Friday afternoon around 2pm. The place was pretty empty and the server seated us at a booth. We noticed immediately that there was something weird about the table--it was huge [we couldn't touch hands with our backs against the seats, which isn't conducive to conversations], it came up to the middle of my chest, and it curved. Boyfriend thought the table was just warped, but all the booths were like that! My silverware kept sliding off my plate and into the middle of the table, so we moved. \n\nThe food was fine. I wasn't like blown away by the burrito packed with cheese and veggies. Skip the guacamole--it's super oily. Our beers were served in giant margarita glasses, which I kinda liked. \n\nThe service wasn't great. She didn't come by very often and we never got water. It also took quite a while to get the bill.\n\nWe were back in here an hour later because Boyfriend's group of pals showed up. This time we were seated on the patio. The nachos are ridiculously huge, which seems like something that they would point out in the menu. They're definitely meant for sharing as an appetizer and not for a single person to sit down and eat! Haha, it was a mountain of chips, real cheese, nacho cheese, and meant. The 2-for-1 margaritas were decent [strawberry was VERY strong, but I couldn't taste much alcohol in the mango so perhaps it hid the flavor]. \n\nOur waitress didn't come by very often and we had to go chase after her to get more drinks and our bills. When one of the guys in the group went to go talk to a manager about it, he was given an it's-not-my-problem response. \n\nOh, and apparently this place turns into a weird night club. We sent a friend through [she reported back as it being partially filled with mostly dudes] and decided to go elsewhere."
0,"American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere, and that's what we know and love about it. However, Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy, fried food taste bland.\n\nOne day, I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox, along with some absurdly good coupons. I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it. I guess I got what I paid for, because the food was barely edible. The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles--no sauce, and I don't think the Fried Rice was actually fried, but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color. I couldn't even find the chicken in my General Tso's--it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce.\n\nI learned my lesson. Trust me, don't get sucked in by their prices--just say NO to Chopstix!"
1,"Forced to go back here to attend a meeting. Ugh. We ordered bahn mi and ramen and  gnocchi with squash and brussels sprouts and shared. The bahn mi was inedibly strange tasting -- I LOVE the bahn mi from the saigon sandwich food cart and from Saigon noodles. Go there if you want a real bahn mi.  The ramen noodles were fine, but the broth was SO bland. I had to ask for several condiments to try to give it flavor.....we didn't eat that one either. We all loved the gnocchi and gobbled up the thimble's worth that they put on our plate. Once again, left hungry and broke and determined not to return. Why do people worship this place?"
2,"It's mid-priced Mexican cuisine on the fast.  Think of it as the next step up from Taco Bell, but a step down from Pedro's or Chi-Chi's.  \n\nNot everything on the menu is a winner, but the pulled pork quesadillas are outstanding and the Mexican gumbo is pretty solid, especially on a really cold day.  \n\nI rarely understand the people behind the counter on the first try.  Usually, they have to ask their question two or three times.  I love our Mexican brethren, but they're not too fluent on zee Engrish...\n\nDon't think this place is the be-all, end-all, but it's okay."
1,"I'm a regular for breakfast at Coppertop, but I'm not going to pretend it's anything more than it is. It's a poorly-decorated diner completely devoid of ambiance, run by Old World misogynists who don't give a shit. (I say this because we have seen the manager slap a waitress' arse while there. She did not seem okay with it.) That said, the food is decent, portions are generous, and it arrives in a timely manner. I have had mishaps there but I have never had to pay for something I didn't eat. I know what I am getting when I go there."
2,"3 stars for now. Had breakfast and it was ok. No better or worse than most other breakfast joints but Hillside is more than a breakfast joint. Hillside is like the Swiss Army Knife of restaurants as they seem to offer a little bit of it all.\n\nGood for small to medium size groups or individuals.  The atmosphere is the offspring of a restaurant, coffee spot, and bar after a drunken night of debauchery and no one knows who the parents are.\n\nThis place is definitely worth a second or third look during different times as the atmosphere seems like it changes throughout the day.\n\nLike a mood ring, I suspect the color of Hillside will change depending on the patron.  So give Hillside a try, and see if this one size fits all fits you."
0,"I don't usually write 1 stars but Moira does deserve this one.  My boyfriend and I went in last night for reverse happy hour, as I have wanted to check out Moira for some time.  \n\nWe walked in and immediately the hostess said 'be right back' and left us awkwardly standing in the entrance for a good 5 minutes.  We were already thinking about leaving but were finally seated and each ordered a Sultry Saki from the cocktail menu.  After about 15 minutes without our drink, we were again seriously pondering just leaving.\n\nI do understand when places are busy or short staffed. This really didn't seem to be the case at all.  Plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight.  \n\nFinally our drink came and it was the weakest, worst, watery drink I have ever had.  When the ice melted in the drink, it still tasted the same.  Huge waste of $6. \n\nThe worst part of the evening came at the end when I got our bill.  I noticed that our waiter overcharged us for the fried tofu, which is under the $3 menu column. \n\n***Keep in mind that the happy hour menu is all black with white text.  \n\nHowever, the waiter was refusing to honor the $3 price because apparently in BLACK pen on the BLACK menu was a  HANDWRITTEN in $5 sign, that you could only see if you held your phone light over the menu.  I actually laughed and told him this is ridiculous and isn't going to happen.  Finally he obliged and took of the $2 overcharge.  \n\nLong story short, terrible drinks, terrible service and watch out of invisible amendments to the menu pricing."
2,"Surreally Expensive\n\nLe Cirque is among the usually chic but overpriced fine dining restaurants that populate the Bellagio. The playful circus-monkeys highwire theme is wonderful but the food and service were not up to par with the decor.\n\nPros: Design, Atmosphere\n\nCons: Food, Service"
3,"I definitely have to say how grateful I am that this place is down the street from where I work. \n\nThe smoothies are tasty and I definitely have enjoyed each one I have tried. \nIt gets a little busy at lunch, so I try to swing by early to beat the crowd. \n\nIt would be great to have a count of ingredients/calories that way you know what you are consuming. \n\nThe only downside I will say, is that I understand customer service can be a little stressful, especially in a rush, however, I am paying $7.50 for a smoothie, not the attitude I get because I asked you if I could possibly add more banana into the smoothie. Whoever is at the register is generally hit or miss, some days you are a huge inconvenience and others you are the best thing that ever walked up to them! \n\nThat aside, I highly recommend."
3,"Very good.  But when they say spicy, you must believe them.\n\nNothing outstanding, just good sushi and sashimi.  Jo-Ann would like to see a better selection of tempura, boxes, etc."
2,"Maybe I am a korean food snob lately but I was underwhelmed with this place.  We went here the other day with a larger group and ordered a ton of food.  Some of it was good, some of it was just so so.  The service was really bad though.  At the end of the meal we waited 45 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us being finished.  I am not joking about this time frame.  After everyone had finished, we waited a polite amount of time, trying to catch the eye of one of the servers and then we finally had to get up to ask for the bill.  Annoying.  At least offer us more drinks if you are going to make us sit there for 45 minutes.\n\nThe food -  Probably the best food was the kimchi pancake and the seafood pancake.  They were delicious and the sauces they came with were yummy.  The bibimbap was good, nothing too special.  I ordered the spicy kimchi pork stew.  The flavor was good and spicy, but I found maybe one piece of something that could have been called pork.  It was ok, I'm still in search of a better korean place...I probably would not go back here."
3,"Get that torta. Fresh bread. The best fries. Eat in so you can get the homemade chips. Make sure you pour the green sauce on the torta. Bomb! Sorry no pic. By the time I thought about Yelp, torta was gone."
1,As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .
3,"Came here for lunch, off the strip, not too many people. All the food was good, u can't go wrong, servers nice, drinks were good, mojitos and sangria good. Good solid 4."
3,"Enjoyed my Pedicure with callus removal and hot paraffin wax treatment!\n\nWax was a bit warm, but I could handle it. \n\n:)"
1,"My in-laws are in town from CA and they loved Native New Yorker in Gilbert, so we thought we would give it a try out here in Glendale.  I really cannot believe the prices for the items on the menu.  79cents per wing? Wow, i missed the bump from 50cents to the 60cent range i guess.  I also noticed the skyscraper burger is almost $12......that is just nonsense.  I pointed this out to my in-laws cause i noticed that Red Robin also did the same thing.  They raised their prices and love to send out artistic meals on fancy plates, but the portions are smaller and taste is not up to par with the price.  Sure enough, my father-in-law ordered a caeser salad and it came out looking nice, but he said it was the worst caeser ever.  It looked fancy....LOL.  My wife ordered a reuben, but when it came to the table, it barely had anything on it.  It was actually sent back to the kitchen and returned later in much better condition.  I ordered a pound of boneless honey hot and they were really good....could of had another pound, but for $10....no way!  \nOverall, the food is not worth the price.  I don't like the direction they have gone.  Improve the quality of the food if you are going to jack up the prices and serve it on new fancy plates.  I will be back, but that is because my in-laws won't give up on it and they will pay the bill for it.  If i am not with them, forget it.....my hard earned dollars will find a better deal."
0,"Participants: \nMyself, My Husband\n\nSetting: \nPhoenix, AZ \n\nBackground:\nWe find ourselves at 11a needing to find a decent hotel in the Tempe-ish area with wifi for the night. We have about 3 hours of solid work online to get done, and plans to head out to the Giants game at 6p. This was a frustrating turn in the day, and I had not yet had the chance to shower or eat breakfast, so I was really looking forward to everything running smoothly. We booked this hotel through Travelocity, and the ratings looked satisfactory, so to the Clarion we go....\n\n12:30 - We arrive at the Clarion.\n\nMe:  We have a reservation.\nFront Desk Clerk: Our system is down.\nMe: Oh, does that affect us getting our room?\nFDC: I don't know if you have a reservation.\nMe: I have the email on my phone, is there something you could do? Just give us a clean room and we can straighten this out later?\nFDC: The system is down, there is nothing I can do.\nMe: Uh...Ok. We will go get something to eat and come back. \n\n2:00 - We arrive back at the Clarion after eating (btw, Biscuits restaurant down the street, fantastic) \n\nFDC: The system is still down.\nMe: Ok, that seems not to be getting fixed very quickly, could we please just have a room?\nFDC: There isn't anything I can do, the system is down.\nMe: Seriously? You can't simply give us a clean room and we can figure this out later? \nFDC: I dont' know what rooms are clean, the system is down. \nMe: There isn't anything you can do?\nFDC: There isn't anything I can do, the system is down. \n\n2:45 - We arrive back at the Clarion after taking a drive. \n\nFDC: The system is still down.\nMe: Im sorry that it is, but we would really appreciate just getting into a room, any room. Ill let you know if it is dirty. \nFDC: Let me have you talk to my supervisor.\nFront Desk Supervisor: The system is down, but I can call and check your reservation. It should only take a few minutes, if you can just wait. \nMe: Thank you, I really appreciate it. \n\nImmediately after this, the Front Desk Clerk gets engaged in a conversation with someone that walks in. Granted, it was about a recently retired coworker that passed away, Im not a monster, and give this moment its due. The conversation continued for several minutes while we waited. Finally after close to twenty minutes of waiting, we were given a room key.\n\nI realize at this moment that I should ask about the wifi password when the \""system\"" comes up. She gave it to me, and I was happy to finally get in the room. \n\nWe get into the room and not only was the table covered in very visible crumbs but there is no wifi, even when the \""system\"" was up. All they had was DSL. This was key as we BOTH had to work. \n\nI had to cancel a client meeting, the room was a total joke, and I would give it a value of around $60-70 instead of the $130 we paid. This was the most expensive hotel on our trip, and by far the worst. \n\nDuring the entire exchange with the staff, no one seemed to have any interest in stepping up to make certain we could get what we needed, which was the room we had already paid for. It should not take close to three hours to check into the hotel room. \n\nThis was horrible customer service, and the hotel was mediocre at best to begin with. FAIL."
2,"We had brunch here  Saturday morning.  The selection was not so great, but my ham & cheese omelette was pretty good.  I'd like to give it another try, next time for dinner.  Hopefully, it will will up to all the rave reviews it has received on here."
1,"I love Sephora for the range of products they offer, samples, awesome return policy, rewards program, and the opportunity to try before you buy. But whenever I come to this location I struggle to get any help from the sales associates. They're either too busy and understaffed, or preoccupied chatting with one another about some gossip, obviously too busy to help. The last two times I needed a new foundation, and when my sister needed assistance picking a new one as well, we have had to do our own color matches. It would be nice to get some input from a make up expert, especially when buying $45+ face paint, but we simply couldn't get some one to help, or even acknowledge us. Also they're frequently out of stock of MUFE HD Foundation in 118 and 120, and going to another location just for foundation is a pain in the butt."
2,"aw man, not as good as I remember! This is still the place to be if quantity is your name and a plethora of meat is your game (points for ambiguity). We went for restaurant week again and this time they changed it so for $30 you get a selection of 8 meats and for $39 you get all 16...we went the big kahuna but I wouldn't do that again.\n\nThe larger option included the filet, ribeye, and bacon-wrapped options. I felt that none were quite as good as the top sirloin which was included in the $30 option, as was the lamb which was nice as well. The bacon options were honestly too salty for my tastes and the Parmesan crusted pork was not crustry but mushy and so it wasn't very good either. I will admit I am sensitive to salt but my boyfriend is a huge fan of the stuff, we both were up half the night chugging water ... so leave some room in your belly for that. \n\nMy dad and boyfriend were in their glory but this time around I was honestly getting a little nauseated from all the meat. \n\nService was good and the place is quite nice but overall the food was just a bit too much for me."
3,"First time here. Located on the NW corner of Oakey and Western. Almost has a diner decor on the inside. Completely not what i expected when i saw the outside. \n\nWas greeted by the cashier that took my order (to-go). Very nice lady. I've been told about the Fried Alligator so i decided to try it. It is listed under Po-Boy's as \""The Swamp\"" with all the toppings and the sauce in the sandwich. They have two sizes. Regular and Large. Regular being 7\"" and Large being 10\"". Opt'ed for the 7\"". Still pricey but i guess thats the premium for alligator. XD \n\nA guy walked in before me so their order was ahead of mine. During the ... approx 25 minutes ... i waited for my order, i saw a table have their order filled (3-4 people?) as well as the guy that was ahead of me (he had 2 items?). A little slow but i wasn't in a rush and i occupied myself with a video on my phone. \n\nWhen i got my order, i had left and decided to eat in my car (not much of a fan of sitting in a restaurant to eat alone XD) and i can watch my video with car's sound system instead of the bluetooth in my ear. \n\nFresh fried fries with cajun seasoning dusted on top. Little under seasoned but nice and crispy. Cole slaw was decent but not much of a fan of cole claw anyway. \n\nThe sandwich itself was wrapped in foil to keep it warm. Not sure how long the sandwich was sitting there prior to me getting the sandwich but if the alligator was fried (looked like it), it wasnt crispy anymore. I guess thats why they gave the option of having the sauce in the sandwich or on the side. Alligator,....  to be honest im not sure how to describe it. Its not as tender as chicken. It has a chewy aspect but not like rubber chewy... Doesn't really have a texture like i guessed (like frog)... almost looked like fried boneless chicken but not o.O Sandwich was pretty good. I think id like to try the alligator by itself, freshly fried and not drenched in sauce to get a real feel of the texture and what not. \n\nOverall, not bad. Would like to come back to try other things if im in the area."
1,"Was this restaurant featured on a show from the Food Network??? I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside, the framed poster from \""Guys Big Bite\"" on one wall, the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall, the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall, or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network.  OK, OK... we get it- you were on TV. \n\nNormally, I would have given this place 4 stars; I used to work down the street and my coworkers and I had take out from here countless times. I have only had the capellini with meat sauce, and the marinara sauce is worth raving over. Today was my first time dining in the restaurant, and will now probably be the last I eat anything from there. I should have stuck with take out only!\n\nDinner was just my husband and me, our bill was $42 (before the tip), and truly was ridiculous for what we had. Paper table cloths on the tables, water served in plastic cups, I ordered a soda, which was brought to me in the can.  We both had small dinner salads, I basically had spaghetti, my husband had some alfredo type dish that was just noodles and bland sauce. We ordered bread, which was an extra $3 charge, but was never brought to us (but also not charged on our bill). I should note as an aside that every time we picked up lunch bread was included with no charge. The waiter tried to upsale everything- I wanted a soda, my husband stuck with water- the waiter pointed out the wine list 3 times. I wanted capellini and sauce, he suggested the Bolognese instead, I declined. I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall, bad service, and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions. We don't mind paying for good food, but the prices do not match the d\u00e9cor, or the service, of the place.\n\nMany other places in the Phoenix area have been featured on Food Network show's as well, not just this one. I'm thinking if you want to try out any of them, skip over this one."
0,"This place was lucky to get our business because my Yelp app hasn't been working and the wireless on my phone was super slow so we just decided, it was in Paris so how bad could it be? \n\nWe had the all you can eat sushi and the rice was hard and cold, just like those ready to eat sushi platters you buy at the supermarkets. The sashimi wasn't fresh and the service was slow. So so disappointing. Probably the worst dining experience I've had in Vegas."
0,First time in town and first time visit. Food was good but not great.  The drunk with her dog sitting at the adjacent table was not a good first expression especially with small children. The wait staff appeared to be brain dead. The kept bringing the wrong order to our table. Will not return the next time in town.
0,"Do NOT be fooled by this place. $39 is outrageous if you're just looking for a good old-fashioned haircut. If you want a haircut by a salon trained \""stylist\"" then you might as well go to GreatClips or SuperCuts. You'll save a lot of money and will get the same result."
0,"All of those 5 star reviews must have been paid reviewers...  my friend went in for a $69.99 alignment and Lorenzo refused to do it because her car was in such \""bad condition.\"" Instead, they jacked the price up to $400 then $800 to fix the brakes because they wouldn't let her drive without fixing them. She said they worked fine. Bottom line is they took advantage of a woman and I thought Community Tire Pros & Auto Repair would be better than Jiffy Lube, but they were WORSE. They claim to be credible yet take advantage of a woman. Go anywhere else but here for your car repair needs unless you want to spend $400 for nothing!! My friend said her car still makes the same noises $400 later... what they are doing is CRIMINAL!!!"
1,"This is so hard. The platinum room is a great venue for music. This was my second time at the club and it left me unimpressed. We went with the intention to eat there. I was reminded why I usuallly stay away from seafood in a venue such as this. \nThe band was great, Cold shott and the huricane horns  played well. two 15 minute breaks in 2 hours is a bit much. \nFrom the beginning of the night the waitress seemed REALLY busy, empty glasses were common. We saw the water/busboy more than our waittress At the end of the niight I had to flag another waitress to get the bill from our waitress.\n\nThe food was not $20 a plate value. We had the coconut shrimp for an appetizer, for dinner I had the salmon and my husband had the sirloin sliders. I give one thing to the kitchen, they are consistent. All was overcooked and dry. And it seems that thier main entrees do not come with sides, you have to order the $6 pilaf and a veggie on the side (in addition to the entree). I have seen this before in upscale restaurants. They usually include some parsley or something on the plate. Not Skye. This was another fail for the waitress, she did not que the sides at all. she simply took the order. It would have been fine if she offered, \""would you like any sides with that?\""\nwe waited for 45 minutes at least for the food after ordering. The club was not busy! I cant help but wonder ifthe food w s done more timely and then spent another considerable amount of time under the warming lights. That would explain the dryness.\n\nCome on guys, I know we are in tough times and business is not up to par, but try at least! And fire the chef,"
1,"I was pretty disappointed in my visit to the gladly... Definitely a fan of citizens public house, but not so much on the gladly. \n\nI brought my husband here for his birthday about 2 weeks ago, we just moved to the area. I ordered the filet and he had the pork chop. Standard cinnamon-y/ apple flavor really not impressive. My steak was over cooked, the flavor was alright.... For the price of the meal, there are so many better options in the area. It was truly a let down, cph is sooooooo good!"
3,"Had a great time here watching the Smashing Pumpkins. The venue may not be ideal for watching a concert due to some challenging sight lines.  However, we managed to have a great time... Until we got asked to leave for doing head stands.  Namaste."
4,Appreciate the new location as it is bigger and better than their old one.\n\nBest bun rieu ever. No questions asked.\n\nFriendly and engaging staff too :)
3,"Dined here for the 2nd time last night.  Had the crab cake the first time and I hate to say but I've had much better.  Last night I had the omelet and salad.  They put anything you want in the omelet.  I had Swiss cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes and asparagus.  It was delicious.  \n\nI can't say enough about the great staff.  Very friendly and attentive.  The view is great and we enjoyed watching the monsoon hit the windows last night!"
1,"I saw this show when it first opened and just came back from a return trip almost ten years later with the kids.  It seems Cirque has given up on this show, and now I have, too.  There were some awe inspiring moments and exceptional performances.  However, the decision to replace the battle scene with a blurry projected version rather than to restage it had the effect of crippling the show.  It seems Ka is on its way out."
3,We went here about a month ago and had a great meal.... I had Barramundi and they modified what went with it for me.... the place was great.... and our waitress was very good!  We ordered Keoke coffee afterward and they were super....We will definitely go again!!
1,"This is a last resort store now.\n\nWe've been shopping here off and on for several years... and since the remodel it's almost impossible to navigate the store.\n\nTheir re-model made the aisles much smaller than they were before.  Now you can only fit 2 carts next to each other at a max. There are tons of stacks of random food/items in each aisle - another thing to avoid hitting.  \n\nThis Fry's is always out of so many things: organic milk, organic produce, cheese and the selection changes it seems weekly. I think they now carry less than they did before the remodel and now they just have larger quantities of certain items.  5 rows of ketchup in 3 different size but no Ken's sun-dried tomato salad dressing...?\n\nAlso they re-modeled the produce area... again... and now it's harder to find items, bags and where the labels are with pricing etc. \n\nThat and they got rid of the nice greeter who was there for years. I mean, you're doing poorly so instead of listening to your customers about why they don't shop here anymore they fire the greeters? Logical.. obviously. \n\nSince it's 'hit or miss' with this store I've been shopping a lot elsewhere where I know they will have certain staple foods(milk) in stock. \n\nThat and the crowd... I'm not sure if it's because it's a Fry's or Kroger but sometime when I'm here I feel like I'm in a Walmart. I understand if you just got out of the pool and are stopping by for a quick item or two... but put pants and a shirt on first."
3,"So far, I've only had positive experiences at this Panera. Their Fuji Apple Chicken Salad is better than most other Panera locations... their baked goods, however, leave something to be desired. Why would you put chocolate sprinkles on a chocolate croissant? It's not a doughnut!\n\nAnyhow, I do like how low-key this location is... the one by Waterfront is way too crowded and hectic."
2,"BUYER BEWARE!  They now sandwich the 1 tray of king crab legs with 2 trays of snow crab legs.  For the novice and the unsuspecting, you can end up with a plate of the less expensive king crab cousins."
3,"Clean place, nice customer service. I love the tacos al pastor and the milanesa torta, the bread they use is so fresh, this is a must try!"
1,"So, I was feeling a little \""meh\"" today, and decided some Thai soup would magically make me better. \n\nI'm still regurgitating the soup as I write. It was like a Great Sea Monster came in my mouth. Salty, fishy -- though not much fish was actually in the broth -- and just an overall sense of death and despair. I liked the Bunsen burner in the middle of the bowl. It flickered and sent little sparks in the air. It was Tottie's way of evoking hell, and it was pretty ingenious. \n\nI'd describe the color of the soup as \""menstrual.\"" A muddy brown-red that complimented the over-cooked flakes of fish. The fish, like so many of us, had just given up. There was no point in being irresistible anymore, swimming in a hot sea of salty discharge. \n\nI waited so long just to flag down the waiter so I could get a glass of water to wash the taste of regret out of mouth. As the minutes rolled by, I thought about things: the brevity of life, how 1 hour and 20 minutes have gone by that I'll never back, if the guy across from me was flirting with me...maybe not. Ok, let's just say he was. \n\nA waitress came at last with a glass of water, which I chugged. She asked if I wanted to take the soup home, but I decided to leave it and have it donated to people who are feeling bad about themselves. I might come back on Ash Wednesday, or  when I need to punish myself, or experience my own personal Apocalypse in the comfort of an Asian restaurant."
1,"My mom and I went to Ruth's Chris on a Friday night two weeks ago for dinner, and arrived at about 7:00pm.  My mom was told by Wendy at the hostess stand that the wait for the dining room would be about 20 minutes, and that if we wanted to eat in the bar, we could be seated immediately.  My mom said we'd wait in the bar for a table in the dining room because I had a migraine and we were told that live music would be starting shortly in the bar area.  After waiting in the bar for nearly an hour, my mom checked in at the hostess stand and asked about our table, and she was told that they thought we were eating in the bar.  Lori came to take us to our table (in the nearly empty dining room) and apologized for the wait.  We asked to speak to the manager, who came over to talk to us a few moments later.  He apologized as well and offered to bring us an appetizer, but at that point, we were just ready for dinner, so he offered to buy us a round of drinks.  Our server arrived shortly, and she was fantastic.  She told us that they would be buying us a round of drinks and took our order quickly.  Our food arrived shortly after, and the food was delicious, as it always is, and the service once we were in the dining room was great.  Once the bill arrived, however, it was clear that the round of drinks we were promised was not taken off of the bill.  We have eaten at Ruth's Chris many times and have always enjoyed the food, and have never been disappointed by the service before this time.  Unfortunately it will be a long time before we go back to the Middleton Ruth's Chris."
4,XS is the best nightclub in Vegas! If you don't want spend a lot of money put your name on the guest list. I went to Vegas two times and I contacted the promoter Michelle (+19087703570) and we didn't pay to go to the club and in addiction we had 2 free drinks each person. I really recommend it!
4,As a longtime lover of KISS I was totally thrilled when this opened.  My husband and I went yesterday and I was thrilled with the entire experience!!  Every member of the staff was awesome with great smiles and great attitude.  The gift shop was stocked with various merchandise to suit every price point.  The music of course was the best with song that rarely get play time on the radio.  The mini golf course was filled with awesome graphics and helpful staff.  During out time there several contest were held.  The restrooms were very clean.  I would recommend this for the entire family and non KISS fans!!
4,"This place is astounding- one of the best meals I've had. The cocktails were fresh and summery. Items from the robata grill, both veggies and beef/sea bass, were tender and flavorful. They served us an amazing mushroom dish with coconut milk and a mix of unique mushrooms- a real treat for the vegetarians at the table- and those of us who aren't too. Taquitos with lump grab meat, tempura veggies.... and a dessert platter with very memorable mochi and little dessert cups that included flakes of gold! It doesn't get any better than this.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark and hip, reflecting the sabor of Peru, Brazil, and Japan- a super innovative and successful fusion of the three countries. Having been to Brazil twice, I liked that they projected video on the walls from Rio de Janeiro- made me nostalgic about my visits!  \n\nA classic upscale, trendy Vegas dining experience- and a fun reminder of the exciting common ground between various world cuisines. Will definitely return!"
3,My girl and i walked into Chili's thinking it was applebee's .....lol.\nI had their new chicken avocado on a pretzel roll sandwich .\nVERY TASTEY !  check it out.\nGood service...
3,"The gammon steak and chips is my all time favourite from the heid sheep in, it is a nuce and cosy pub with lovely and welcoming staff and reasonable prices."
1,"I love the idea of getting mail and packages in the mail. I even love the old-fashioned idea of the U.S. Postal Service and feel sorry for their slow extinction.\n\nI don't love the idea of having to pick up packages in person from this station.  \n\nThe line is always long and the service S.L.O.W.  They have a separate pick-up only window that is rarely open or staffed, so you usually have to wait in line with everyone else doing paid transactions.  The staff seems to have no motivation to be helpful or move quickly - they just plod unhappily along.\n\nPost Office Purgatory!"
3,"Mel's is great. One of the very few places open 24 hours around campus. The best part is they have all-day (ahem... all-hours?) breakfast, so you can get your pancakes, eggs or french toast at 3am if you want.\nThe portion sizes are also a big plus considering the very reasonable prices. I always end up ordering way more food than I can actually eat."
2,"I placed and online pickup for 7am, and they were totally ready for me with a hot breakfast! \nThe only downside was that the eggs Benedict was too sweet, as were the sweet potato tots. I was in the mood for savory and everything tasted like it has added sugar."
0,lady in the pharmacy not Karen but the Caucasian with lots of make up on her face and long hair RUDEEEEE! as the pharmacist was assisting me she was like can you move to the side as the pharmacist was helping me looked at me with the ugliest facial expressions ever.... don't like this location
0,"The food is way overpriced for the quality. We had spring rolls-more greasy than most and soggy in the middle. My pad thai tasted nothing like pad thai-just grease and a cheap sauce, no flavor. My husband had the house fried rice and it was steamed rice with a few veggies and cold shrimp. He had a coffee and I had green tea. Our bill was $60. Nothing was good. We will never eat there again."
4,My sister and I went here and it was great. She had the crab stack and I had the lucious fish tacos.I went back again and my husband had the fish and chips and I had the halibut special. Again just wonderful. Place is pretty and service was friendly. Plus they have valet parking!
1,"if it weren't for the decent beer selection, (second visit here and i had S.T. Count Hopula and Stone Smoked [vanilla] Porter) this place would get 1 star. \nWe had dang near the worst service in all the 32 years i have lived in Phx. being that there were only 2 other customers besides our party, on a Saturday @ lunch hour, the service was unacceptable. all the time it took and hassle from the kitchen about fish and chips resulted in a $13 plate of food that was worth about $4. I would have seriously considered a Big Mac if foresight were applicable.. it was that bad. \n\nanyway, stop in to quaff a beer if you're on the way to another spot, but dont come here with the exclusive intention of having a good time. chances are, it will elude you. \nas one reviewer claimed, there are better English Pubs in BF Egypt. He could very well be right."
3,"Location is everything. I do not know how this place actually does for business as I've only been a few times. However the times I have been there almost no one else is in there compared to Starbucks on East which would be near packed at the same time of day.\nThis saddens me a bit because I love good coffee shops and the coffee here is much better than Starbucks.\nThe atmosphere is nice and even though it looks plain from the outside because it is in a little shopping center, the inside is quite amenable to work, study, read or host business meetings or coffee dates.\nI'd like to see this place do well simply because I like the coffee. If it was in a unique building in a trendy part of town, this place could be killing it."
4,"I went here over the weekend with my step daughter.  She needed to get a polish change and I needed a manicure and pedicure.  The tech that help me was amazing - I didn't get her name :(  I got a regular pedicure because my feet have become swollen from being 39 weeks pregnant and not really being able to reach my toes. I also got a gel manicure which has NOT chipped at all. I have gotten a gel manicure before, not at this salon but it chipped 2 days later and I was livid.   Overall, my experience was awesome, I will come back here to get my nails done."
0,Awful undercooked.  Got the runs from one piece.  Paid $22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick.
4,"I went to get my right tragus pierced, and they were very nice. The piercer (I think CJ. He has his ears stretched out rather large, and I think stretched nose piercings, too.) was super nice and tolerant of my slightly-nervous perky chatter. He called me \""hon\"" a lot, which, originally being from Texas, I totally dug. I will definitely go back to get my left tragus pierced, and whatever else I feel like getting poked."
4,We come here every year and love the party atomsphere the young the old just a great time had by all :)))
4,"went back to Kobalt last Thursday for Trivia night and I'm telling you this place is a blast. Trivia cost $5 per team. Bring 5 people on your team you guys only put in $1 each. You can win over $100\nThe questions were hard, I didn't know the answers to any of them, haha good thing I didn't get on a team.\nHad a $3 mojito though, so good. \nlove this place"
2,"I actually liked this place a lot. I was really surprised to see the bad reviews. My friend and I saw the all-you-can-eat sushi special and were delighted by the very idea of lots of sushi. I found the sushi to be delicious, but the selection was limited as it usually is for all-you can-eat deals. I also liked the decor. It was bit loud because the casino floor isn't very far, but not nearly as loud as a buffet."
0,"I used this company a few months back and this is the first negative review (unfortunately) that I've given on Yelp. the first appointment had to be rescheduled due to lack of personnel available. The person they finally did send out (Martin) was an independent contractor. I went over all the areas I wanted cleaned (both interior & exterior). I left to do errands and came back when Martin said he would be finished. The car actually looked WORSE that before, with completely hazy windows, water spots on the exterior, and NOTHING had been done to the interior. I called Tiffany immediately and she said she said she wasn't able to send anyone out but could I email her photos. I did as requested, and she offered to do a different detail but would need still need to charge me. I'd already paid for detail via Amazon Local, and now she wanted me to pay her more?? Bottom line- do not use this company."
1,"I wanted to like this place and have it become my sweets destination with my co-workers. However the last time we went in one coworker and I grabbed cups and started making our yogurt using the self service machines. The other two coworkers within asked for a sample and were in the fence about ordering. When they decided not to buy the owner confronted them and chastised them \""uh hello? You're leaving? Ask for a sample and leave, I'm trying to run a business here!\"" This all happened as we were at the register and was awkward and inappropriate. The yogurt is pretty standard just like all the other places in town."
4,Being from Vegas you kind of get used to quality service since the whole town is based off of hospitality but these guys still managed to wow me. After a manic search for my keys for hours I called these guys in a panic. Carmon showed up and had a new lock made in under an hour and some how managed to put a smile on my face. \n\nThe price and quality of work is unbeatable.
0,Stopped here for lunch with my wife at about 11:30 - food steam trays were cold - asked if there was a problem - was told steam trays were not working right - they would give nothing off the bill even though we ate only a couple of spoonsful. Should have called the health dept. Will not eat here again.
2,Smoothie was fine.  Service was fine.  Just really really slow.  I'll continue going to the drive through one up the street.
0,"Being in the service industry I'm very forgiving, but this place left me mad that I wasted my money. Neither the hostess nor server brought a highchair for my baby, I finally had to ask another server to bring one. That was after 10 min of people walking past me with a 1 yr old on my lap. Then the food was subpar. My daughters pancakes were heavy and gooey almost raw. My \"" kitchen sink\"" salad was all lettuce with only a couple pieces of  meat, cheese ect.... Not worth the $14.00 we paid.  I left Hungary  and mad."
3,"I've been shopping here  for years, the staff is GREAT. I rarely walk out empty handed, so many bargains"
1,"We went early today ( Saturday) knowing that the wait is usually long. We waited about 20 minutes, not too bad but we won't be coming here any time soon on our own volition.\n\n I ordered the Huntington Omelette-  the omelette kinda sucked- the avocado on top was not ripe and the cheese had no flavor. The hash browns which we ordered extra crispy were only half cooked (hate to see how they would have been otherwise).   I did not bother to take more than 4 or 5 bites. I did order the Red Velvet Pancakes-  they deserved 4 stars! They were very good.   \n\nMy husband ordered  the corned beef hash which he said  was \""nothing to write about.  He thought it tasted very bland & almost canned although the menu states it was home made.  He was also disappointed in the hash browns.  He ordered the Smores pancakes.  He liked them-I found them way too sweet.\n.  \nService was quick and our server was pleasant."
0,"While I understand that this is a chain restaurant, I still think there are much better Mexican food places to go to than Arriba.\n\nThis was my first experience with Arriba Mexican Grill. I ordered the Chile Colorado. The menu designates this as a 2-chile (fiery) dish and to me it was mildly spicy (1-chile or snappy according to their ratings). I was supposed to get rice, beans and tortillas with this and when it was brought to my table, there were no frijoles negro nor tortillas. I pointed this out to my waitress. She apologized and said that she'd be back with them right away. About 5 min later, she walked by the table with no beans or tortillas in sight and asked her about them again. She forgot.  By the time I got my beans and tortillas, I was done with my dinner!!!\n\nAfter paying for my meal and going up to the front, I asked to speak to the manager about this horrible situation (I waited to complain to the manager because I didn't want my food tainted by something - seen it done too many times when I worked in a restaurant). I told the tale of experience to the manager and it fell upon deaf, or unsympathetic, ears.\n\nI WILL NEVER EAT, DRINK OR STEP INTO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!"
1,"Poor Bill. He was really craving wings yesterday, and rather than stop at one of the nearby favorites, we checked Yelp to point us in the direction of the best wings in town. We wanted to try Long Wongs, after reading some reviews that said many people considered the wings here as their favorite. We again, for whatever reason, decided to pass on a few closer LW's to experience the one in Tempe. \n\nIt was easy to find, and at 3:30 in the afternoon there was no issue parking. So far, so good. We decided to sit t the bar, like we often do, and I think that was our best decision of the whole trip, because the bartender was fantastic. I wish I would have asked her name, because she's the only reason LW's gets 2 stars instead of one. \n\nBill and I both ordered a beer on tap and looked over our (paper, printout) menus. There were a few things that sounded good to me but I wanted to stick with the plan, so I got a dozen boneless wings and Bill got a dozen bone-in. He got half hot and half garlic parmesan, and I got half spicy BBQ and half garlic parm as well. No one gave me a hard time for ordering chicken nuggets with sauce, so I once again figured \""so far, so good.\"" \n\nOur food came out in styrofoam containers and solo cups, along with plastic bags of what would be carrot sticks if they were twice as fat, and some ranch dressing (in solo cups) to dip them in, I anyone even bothered. The garlic parm sauce bears a curious resemblance to plain old ranch dressing. Don't bother. The hot sauce and the spicy BBQ were ok. Nothing great. The boneless wings made me feel like a kid. At least BW3 serves something breaded, and roughly the size of the big kid's wings. Bills wings were kind of small, and he said they were overcooked. If it matters to any wing fans, he got mostly wings; one one drummie of each sauce. He was happy with the ratio, or at least he would have been were they better. \n\nWe won't be back for food. If there's any small chance either of us go back at all, it's because we're in the area and want to have a beer, but even then we might just pick one of the dozens of other bars in the area."
0,"Poor excuse of a BK! Stay away, they forgot my dessert, the food's cold, had to wait a while at the drive thru, plus they don't even have a full Burger King menu."
2,"Monday morning we decided to have lunch at this place. It was not very busy and we asked to be seated outside. We got seated in couple of minutes. But it took our waitress full 15 minutes to come check on us and see what wanted to drink. I ordered onion soup and seafood crepe.  The onion soup was very sweet, when I complained the waiters told me it's the Spanish onions and not sugar.  But it was to sweet for my taste she took the Onion soup away but did not take it off the bill. The crepe was good with lots of shrimp and scallops. The best part was the baguette, we ate 2 of these baguette with butter and jam. The coffee was weak and slightly warm to the touch."
0,"A few weeks ago this location was having a special on first time hair cuts. I needed one so I went for it. I received one of the worst cuts of my life. When I pointed out issues the girl just kept making it worse. I complained to the salon manager who then did as much repair as possible and told me to give it a few weeks to grow and the next cut would be free. I just got off the phone with this location. the manager is no longer with them and there is no record of my visits. This is crappy customer service. to top it off the original hair butcher sent me a \""come back and see us\"" card stuffed with coupons. Great! except the coupons had expired. Really?\nMy advise, Stay away!"
4,"Maybe it's time to pull out those old Tom Petty records, because naturally he is correct when he told us that The Waiting is the hardest part.\n\nNot too long after I posted that last update, I received a call - a call, mind you, not an email or a letter, but a call! - from a manager a Roby to explain that they had some shake-ups in their management structure.  What that meant is that though they had tried to make sure all customers were aware, and that calling the old manager was a bad idea, there were probably some people who slipped through the cracks.  Guess who one of those might have been?  (That's my comment there at the end.)\n\nAnyway, after we talked a bit, and I explained that everything was actually working, and we just needed a few tweaks (light housings that could handle insulation were installed vs housings that could not, that sort of thing), we actually scheduled an appointment and the technician spent the better part of a day fixing things up to get us back on track.\n\nSo not only are they checking up to make sure customers are happy by reading places like Yelp, but they followed up and corrected the problem, in a much shorter time than the initial issue, and now we're moving along again.  And I don't have to look for another electrician.  Sweet."
3,"Always decently crowded, Genna's is a really great place to get a drink. It's never too packed, but never empty and awkward. They have a lot of seating, so I've never had a problem finding a chair. And it's not so loud that you feel like you have to scream.\n\nThey have a good selection of beers. Awesome happy hour prices. I like the two floor layout with a bar on both. I like the outdoor seating (lots of it). Lighting is good - dark but not weirdly dark. I really like the chalkboard that lists all the beers upstairs.\n\nService: I've never felt the bartenders were all that friendly. They get your drink, you pay, that's it.\nEnvironment: Not too pretentious. Not too college-y. Good lighting - not bright, but not DARK. Not too loud. Overall, very chill."
4,Great selection of stores.
2,"Its really just a haircut joint, nothing special. I usually let Jasmine cut my hair.  She does a good job consistently. I had my hair cut for a new job & she did an excellent job, scissors up top & clippers on the side."
4,"Dr. Sharma is not just a doctor, he is your health advocate. I was able to get an appointment within 24 hours and his desk staff was happy to do so. He listened to my situation then consulted me on the issue. I really believe I have found an amazing doctor in Las Vegas. I highly recommend Dr. Sharma and his facility . The couches instead of plastic chairs in the lobby are a nice touch as well. Go see Dr. Sharma today."
4,"This place is easily the best place for wings and sports in the area!  TVs all over the place are huge for anyone playing fantasy football.  I sat here all day on a Saturday for college football and it was such a great place to watch games I came back the following Sunday for pro games.  \n\nWait staff is great and very helpful even if something goes a little wrong.  Quick to fix anything.\n\nUFC fight was free too!  Where else you find that in the East Valley these days?\n\nThey treat me great everytime, definitely recommend Cogburns."
4,"Love coming here! It's quite a ways from home but worth the drive, the food is excellent and the service is better! Ask for Michael!"
4,"BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique and fantastic with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite to the sweetness of the base with it's slight tang. The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off the bone with a slight resistance. I'd kill for these ribs! ...I'm serious... For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced. I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs."
2,This is a place to go and check out all the new stuff they apple has come out with and this is the place to take your broken apple stuff. I really like to go in this place and look at everything the one problem is that there are always so many people there and it is hard to look at the things that you want to look and they never have enough people there to help you out. But if you make an appointment then you should be fine and can get your broken stuff looked at
2,"This place isn't as good as Orgin India (just down the street) or  India Palace (also just down the street), but you can do a lot worse.\n\nWe have dined here a few times (with our 1-year-old), and we had a great time.\n\nThe food is good--not stellar--but good.  It has what I consider to be a run-of-the-mill Americanized Northern Indian menu.  Typical selection of Indian beers.  Staff was very friendly.  Food was great quality.  Everything we have ordered has been good."
3,"OK, finally made my first trip into a Capriotti's, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  I'm from NJ originally so my standards for Cheesesteak sandwiches are pretty high and that is the only reason it gets a 4, instead of a 5.  The shop was clean, well staffed and though there was a line I was on my way out the door with lunch in hand in less than 10 mins. How I went 6 years (4 of them right down the street from this location) and never stopped in is beyond me, but I'm glad I did.  Looking forward to trying the Chicken Philly next time around.  \n\nOh yeah....be careful...12\"" is a medium...the large is a staggering 20\"".  That is was justifies the higher than normal prices (bigger than normal sandwiches...step down a size from what you get elsewhere and it will cost the same, be as filling and taste better)."
3,"I am pretty surprised at this place. The staff are all attractive, drinks are expensive but for a night out every once in a while, it's a good place to go. Bartender's are friendly, some of the staff doing rounds(including bar backs) act like they are obviously way to busy to talk to anyone. I enjoy the outdoor bar, it has a relaxing feel to it and the bartender that works out there knows what he's doing, making conversation with customers and getting to other customers in a fashionable manner and quickly.  All in all I had a wonderful time here, it was fun for me and my girls and I will definitely go back for another night out in a few weeks. (I'm still recovering from the last night out ;) haha)"
4,"Do you want an escape from your typical Arizona dining experience? Do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional German clothing holding tubas? You really need to check this place out. I live about 5 minutes from here and it took me a full year and visiting relatives to finally get to downtown Glendale to check it out. \n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation on the patio (It was a Saturday and I wanted to be safe but for 4, you could have done without the reservation). We sampled several German beers and I loved them all (wish I remembered the names). We started with the giant pretzel and sausage sampler-both were SO good I am still drooling. The Sausages were served over a bed of sauerkraut and the pretzel with spicy mustard. Everyone at the table tried something different and we all sampled everything. I loved the German potato salad served with the entrees and also the cabbage soup. \n\nThe ambiance of this place was fantastic! The live music is from 6-8 and I really wish it went later. My boyfriend and I agree that eating there really makes you feel as though you are on vacation-far away from Arizona! I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique!"
0,Bad Service. Bad Food. My boyfriend ordered a kolashampan and they were flat. Ugly interior with a sign that says Welcome To Gringo's. I ordered the plantains with cream and beans. These were the most watered down beans I ever had. Horrible. My boyfriend's egg had runny oil. Ugh. I wish I had a warning.
1,"XS is a great club --- BUT the promoters/hosts are very snobby. Too quick to answer without really trying to help. It's a shame, because once you get inside its really fun. But the people working it doesn't make people want to come back. \n\nWe got in fine, we only waited 15 minutes when we arrived, no cover charge. But I just hate talking to the first few promoters, cuz they are soOo uptight and I just want to punch them in the face because they are not listening to my questions. \n\nAnd btw, I go clubbing alot, and it's very unnecessary to be this snobby. I love when promoters are super nice and know how to work their guests so they have a great experience. \n\nC'mon XS, get the front men promoters together! You know its a stressful job, but you signed up for it. It's Vegas for goodness sake."
4,"From the moment we were seated, our lovely waitress answered our questions and was more than happy to make recommendations when (as usual) I couldn't make up my mind over 2-3 options. Her recommendations were spot on, including the bottle of red wine that my friend and I ordered. Everything just seemed delicious and worth trying! However, life isn't always that fair, SO...\n\nFor the appetizers, we shared a small lobster poutine and lentil bruschetta. I would wholeheartedly suggest the bruschetta. It was fantastic and exploding with flavour! I could have never imagined it coming together as perfectly as it did. On the other hand, I had big expectations of the lobster poutine. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the spot, as I didn't find a single chunk of lobster in my dish... The fries tasted great, so did the lobster gravy, but I did want some lobster in my lobster-poutine. C'est tout.\n\nFor the mains, we ordered the walleye fish in bonito broth with speck and egg pasta, and the pork chops over eggplant and kale. While the walleye fish was good, it was a little on the salty side. However, my pork chops were mind blowing. I was skeptical, as I often find them to be overcooked and dry, but WOW... They were moist, tender, and flavorful, that's all I can begin to even say about them.\n\nHonestly, I was surprised I could even get a reservation here just a day before, but it worked. Maybe because it was in the middle of the week at a late time, but no matter what, this place is constantly on the go and so bangin'. Check it out, no matter how long the wait may be!"
2,"Great place to go with a big group for something different than just heading out to the bars. I've been to the original one in Munich, and its American incarnation was pretty much along the same lines--beer, table-dancing (well, bench-dancing) to cheesy songs that everyone knows the words to, and lots of fun.\n\nAs far as beer goes, I wasn't big on their Weizen (wheat beer) and I'm not a fan of lagers in general. Love their Dunkel though, so I always order that. Most of my friends always get the light beer...no comment. Food here isn't very good. Zucchini planks are the only thing I like (huge portion, good for snacking with a group). All the meat dishes are extremely dry and heavy on the salt. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner/drinking combo. Eat elsewhere, then come here to drink.\n\nAnother negative, the place gets way too crowded. If you come before 10pm, there will be an obscene wait for a table (and it's not fun if you don't get a table). Sometimes table reservations will be booked for the night as early as 7pm. Come late, and you can usually find some friendly strangers to jump in with. It's a little bit of a hassle to come here on a regular basis, but for birthdays or other special occassions, it's a great spot."
4,"Love, love, love this place. \n\nTheir pizzas are amazing! They offer gluten-free, which is nice, and they have tons of other menu options, too. \n\nPersonally, I want to do their meal challenge where you have to eat one of their GIANT pizzas in a certain amount of time, but I'm trying to keep my svelte figure...by eating only slightly unhealthy amounts of pizza. \n\nBecause I eat a lot of Venezia's...a lot."
4,"I chose the Signature because the price was great for the suite I wanted but was sold on the fact that the whole hotel is non-smoking and there was no casino in the hotel.  I don't gamble and can't stand the smell of smoke (I know...what the hell am I doing in Vegas, right? hahaha)\n\nAnyway, the hotel was so nice that we decided to extend our \""quick overnight getaway\"" to a three day holiday.  I had made some arrangements with the hotel for a surprise birthday celebration and it somehow got messed up so they offered to take care of it with a generous compensation. Now that's customer service!!\n\nThe whole hotel is clean which is great for a semi-germaphob like myself.  Our room had a balcony featuring mountain and strip views, a full kitchen, living room, two sinks (which I feel always keeps a male and female sane when staying in the same place), a whirlpool tub, a glass stall shower, and a guest bathroom complete with glass stall shower.  Wish I had my ipod to take advantage of the ipod alarm clocks, and the crackling flamed fireplace on our pop-up tv in the bedroom for the turndown service was a great touch when we came back to the room after dinner.\n\nIt's convenient to get to the strip and MGM through the Signature Towers connecting tunnels.  It almost feels like your own secret passage way since only Signature guests can gain access to the tunnels with their room keys.  The Pool is great...relaxing and pool side food service was quick.\n\nWould definitely come again as the service was wonderful and the room was fabulous!!"
3,"I would actually give this place 4 1/2 stars, but it falls just short of being perfect. To start, our server was excellent. She was spot on for all of her recommendations and descriptions. Her wine recommendation, which I think was the house cabernet sauvignon, was fantastic. I had the kobe ribcap, my other dinner mates had the kobe ribeye, filet mignon, and scallops. My steak was cooked nicely med-rare, and tasted amazing with fantastic marbling. However, it seemed like the other steaks were cooked just a bit less than requested. You can taste the mesquite wood flavor in the meat, although I didn't think it enhanced the flavor too much. The starter duck fat fries are excellent, as is the foie gras slider appetizer. The truffle mac and cheese is a must try. The mushrooms were a little salty (maybe they're supposed to be), but had good mushroom flavor. At the end of the meal, we were too stuffed to try any desserts, but their coffee was a perfect finish to a very nice meal."
1,"Overpriced for quality of service. Its clean and nice yes, ppl are nice and speak english yes. Have i ever had a wow mani/pedi, NO. Im from LA and come here regularly so i need a local nail place, i have found that most Vegas nail places are overpriced and not so great and this is probably the nicest of those. But that doesnt mean you get what you pay for. They recently bought the salon next door and are hard selling those services, so i tried the blowout which i was quoted 45 on the phone, and i asked the receptionist to give me someone good with long hair as i am picky. So she says this guy is great. To sum it up he was more tempermental and flamboyant than he was talented. I asked for barrel curls and i got velcro rollers set in my hair for an hour while i got a pedi, to end up with 80s prom hair. I told him i wasnt happy with it and he tried to make it about the fact that i didnt want him to put a ton of mouse and hairspray on. But i am a licensed stylist and i know that if you cant get style without freezing the hair in place you should find something else to do. To add insult to injury he actually wanted to charge me MORE! yes 65 because my hair was long. UM excuse me??? you didnt even do it right and you want MORE MONEY. smh. First off even DRY BAR in Beverly Hills charges 35 for blow/style flat no matter the length, and they do it right! The owner saw my frustration and said she would take care of that. Ya nice. but i still paid 45 for a lame blow dry and went home to flat iron it out before my event. EPIC FAILURE on the salons part, they lost a client for both hair and nails and got a poor review. Not a great way to run and grow your biz."
2,"I've been here a few times to meet colleagues for a drink after work.  It has a nice wood interior and the booths have plenty of room for people to sit comfortably even when it gets packed.  Parking can be difficult if the area is busy, so arrive early if you want to park close.\n\nThe happy hour menu is pretty good and so is the food.  My two favorite apps to order are:\n\nCheese Curds\nPretzel\n\nThe Cheese Curds are especially good....you can't find them in very many places and the few that have it aren't as good as this place.  The Pretzel is pretty awesome too.\n\nOverall, it's not too bad of a place.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%"
0,"Warning: This place is now called China Star.  I suspect they had to send this place into the restaurant witness protection program because so many diners were looking to wipe them off the map.\n\nOne of the worst of the worst kind of Chinese restaurants-in-a-box.  The idea that this place calls itself a \""Chinese\"" restaurant in a city which boasts several authentic Chinese places (the best of which, Ichiban, is not to be missed!) is a joke.  The food is tasteless and full of veggie filler.  The sesame chicken was, quite literally, inedible.  It tasted like old socks.\n\nNasty food brought to your door is still nasty food.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague."
1,"I did not have a great experience. The tech was proficient for sure, but she told me a story of a woman who had 5 failed pregnancies, and said, some women just aren't able to stay pregnant. I have had a miscarriage and am pregnant again, so for me this was the last thing I wanted to hear!  I won't be going back."
3,Excellent food and good service.
2,"Generally, this place is decent. My family and I have been coming here for years. Everything is relatively consistent, which we like. The staff is very nice. This may be super biased because, like I said, we've been coming here for years. They recognize us and my mom knows some of them personally. This is literally my moms go-to Thai restaurant whenever she doesn't feel like cooking. The only reason it has 3-stars is because I believe the sanitation is questionable. They're not too big on upkeeping while the restaurant is going. This is not appealing for any guest. Like I said, not bad though."
4,"Awesome experience! Efficient professionals. Couldnt have been a smoother experience. Great pricing, great customer service"
1,"I can't even guys, I mean really.  There were people huddled around the front door smoking.  The service was slow, they give these thin little slices of bread when you pay for extra bread and get a COLD lil tiny slice."
2,"My jets are cooling on Jenny-Street Market... Now that I live in the neighborhood and I find myself stopping by more and more often, the shine is starting to tarnish. \n\n- Produce is taking a steady turn for the worse. Some seasonal items remain outstanding, but for the most part, most of their items leave much to be desired in terms of quality.\n\n- The layout is terrible. Nothing is in a logical place. I've probably walked 10-miles in those aisles over the course of a year while looking for items. \n\n- Crowded checkout area. Always a line. And, if I had a nickel for every person who's gone to pay only to learn it's cash only (and then go to the ATM while the line waits)... ugh. \n\n- Expensive. Case in point: Cowboy Charcoal. $9.99 for 8-lbs at Jenifer Street. $5.99 for 8-lbs at Woodmans. \n\n+ Outstanding beer cooler. I think I'll limit my shopping here to this area and be happy (minus the wait to check out)."
1,"Went to the Wicked Spoon on a Sunday night. Their price has recently gone up to $35. I think there are other buffets in Vegas which have better tasting food for less price. At first, the small dish thing looks nice. But here are some of my observations.  Because most of the dishes are in its own small dish, all the food seems to be cold, from the lobster bisque I had to potato gatin.. also, since they are already portioned out, there is no way for you to try just a bite to see what something tastes like. So I ended up taking, but only taking one small bite and not finishing the rest because it either did not taste to my liking. Waste of food. The other thing is that there is only so many small dishes you can carry. So you end up taking a lot of trips to the bar.\n\nThere were 3 things I really wanted to try from reading the reviews here... the crab claws, risotto, shu-mai.  None of those things were available. In general, most of the dishes were very salty or very sweet.  The lamb at the carving table was really tough and not edible. And the chocolate used in the desserts seemed like plastic.\n\nFor me the best dishes were the cold shrimp cocktail (the shimp was bing and plump), and the spinach salad. Other than that, the food you get at the buffet at Green Valley Ranch is much more tasty (and cheaper too!)"
1,"I wish I could give a better rating. It really isn't a bad place. It's chill and hipster. But what I had there tasted awful.\n\nI ordered iced tea but what they gave me was not lemony nor did it have any citrus flavour typical for iced tea. It wasn't even sweetened!! Furthermore the color was blood red! What are they playing at? Sorry, this iced tea detered me from wanting to go back. Maybe the coffee drinks are good, but definitely not this damned \""iced tea\""."
0,my husband and i stayed here because we bought a travel zoo voucher we had a suite  but the hotel was very boring no one was in the club and the sports lounge was a joke it was playoffs and it was only three couples there.  This place must be going out of business wont be back the room was average
4,I liked this place alot! The food and service was great! And I really like the ALL you can eat Sushi idea! The only thing is that its kinda expensive. Most dishes were more then $12 for 8 pieces. All the chefs were really cool though. I will definitely be going back.
0,"My husband and I were really excited to get an apartment here. We first found the place because I work very close, it would be perfect to walk to work. One of the managers showed us a WONDERFUL apartment that we fell in love with. It was great, we loved the location, the d\u00e9cor, etc.. We put in our application and waited to see. They approved us after a few days, and when we showed up to sign the lease, they pulled a bait-and-switch. They claimed someone else had gotten that apartment because we hadn't put down our deposit early enough. Oh really, sir?\n\nFirst of all, the 2 days in a row we went to try and put down our deposit, they were \""closed for a holiday\"" and so on the 3rd day we went again and they did not mention anything about already leasing that unit out. They took our deposit like everything was fine.\n\nSo imagine our surprise when we go to sign the lease a couple days after that and it's a totally different unit number. The next 2 units they tried to sell us on were both facing the hot West exposure in a desert valley. Big no-no. AND both of those units were located right next to loud, yippy ankle-biter dogs. My dog is a medium-sized and very quiet dog. I hate loud yippy dogs. Not to mention these units were right by the dumpsters :/\n\nThankfully, they gave us our deposit back. We were out the application fee, which was totally understandable. What was totally NOT understandable was the bait-and-switch tactic they used. Completely ridiculous.\n\nDo not live here."
4,"Fried chicken was awesome, great atmosphere but a bit too loud for my taste. \nService was great even though it was packed."
3,Came here with a 24 hour buffet pass. Overall it was a good buffet. Can't say much for the hotel or the casino as I didn't partake in that aspect of the business. The buffet had your standard selection of various food and dessert options. Everything tasted satisfactory. I would say the bonus was that the server we had was very generous and gave us two complimentary bottles of champagne when he found out it was my friends birthday.
2,"The one thing with Bashas (as opposed to Fry's) is that things are a hit or miss.  Some items, they've got great prices on but others are more expensive.  This store is clean, large (in comparison to some Bashas), and the employees are friendly."
1,"My trip to Burgatory got off on a bad start because we were given a 45-60 minutes wait for a table on a Monday night. And once you're way out in Timbuktu (the Water Works), it's not like you're going to change your mind and hop back in the car, so we wandered the soulless shopping plaza for at least 45 minutes before being given a table. \n\nI understand a wait on a Friday or Saturday night, but on a Monday night? This place is clearly too popular for its own good. And needless to say, my stomach was growling with sky-high expectations by the time we sat down. \n\nI love that the restaurant attempts to simplify the meat-ordering by asking you what color you want your meat to be (red, pink, slightly pink). But when I ask for pink, and I get brown, it's a lot worse than a misunderstanding of what \""medium-rare\"" means. And that's my biggest gripe. Everyone at the table asked for different colors, and we all wound up with the same blah brown.  \n\nAside from the actual burger cooked level, the shakes were lovely, the beer selection varied, and the toppings were outstanding. But if you claim to be a burger place, you have to do your burgers right. If I end up back there, I'll insist on \""RED\"" but I won't go out of my way to wander around the Water Works aimlessly for another hour of my life when Tessaro's and Winghart's are closer and better."
1,"J and I went for Sunday Morning brunch at Wandering Horse the other Sunday. With all the 5 star reviews, we figured this place would be a hit. In the end, we were disappointed. J definitely was when he was given the total price at the register. Did he have sticker shock? That's putting it lightly! He stated, \""For $50+ for the 2 of us, this better be good!\"" \n\nThe dining room is very nice and the staff is extremely friendly. After getting our drink order put in, we walked into the food room. Not as much of a selection as I had expected. I'm usually all over some Chinese food, but after looking over the selection, I passed it over. For the section we overall enjoyed the most, it was hands down the Mexican food. \n\nHere's a rundown of what we tried and liked/disliked: \n\nSushi - J said they were pretty good for California Rolls. \nPrime Rib - Very tender. Lacking in flavor though. Thank goodness for the horseradish sauce. \nPeppered bacon - Very fatty. J said it was more like eating a slice of fatty ham than crispy bacon. \nFrench Toast w/ Blueberry sauce - This was a favorite of mine. \nGreen Chili - This was one of our favorite dishes. Paired with the fresh house made tortillas, beans, and rice. \nLamb Chops - This was our other favorite dish. Very flavorful and tender. \n\nAll in all, we felt like it wasn't worth the money for us to eat there."
0,Horrible service! Will never come back here again. All my yelp friends beware. If your ever in vegas don't come here unless you want to leave hungry!!! Have to put 1star rating coz I have to!
4,"My husband took me here in our very first date (7years ago) and every year we make a visit. I am absolutely addicted to their crawfish cheesecake and my goodness the crab puffs are amazing. Every visit I contemplate getting a platter of the crab puffs for myself and no one else. The bartenders have always been outstanding with their recommendations and drink specials and extremely friendly when waiting for your table. I love the atmosphere and the waitresses are usually on point and keep our water glasses full which is my biggest pet peeve. Definitely make this a stop if you enjoy and intimate atmosphere with rich food. I am still keeping it 5 stars despite my one issue which is there has rarely (if any) been a menu change in the 7 years of me eating there. Their nightly/weekly specials --when available are delicious, too!"
1,"Is it me or has the quality of food gone down? I  have been going to Pin Kaow for years and it was one of my favorite thai restaurants because of it's authenticity. However, I recently went after a very long time and I was so disappointed in the food. I feel like the food is not authentic and flavorous as it use to be. The food was just so bland and lacked the quality it use to have. Before, Pin Kaow was the best thai restaurant in Vegas, but I don't think that is true anymore. Hopefully I'll find one that I enjoy like I did with Pin Kaow when it use to be really good."
4,"I love Whole Foods! This location makes me feel like a little kid on Christmas! The selection of fine cheeses is awesome and they always have a fabulous one to sample. My latest discovery is the little boy blue, it is soooooo good. I also love that I can find Oak Creek Amber here too, the hubs favorite beer."
1,"If you are looking for quantity over quality, then this is the place for you.  Portion sizes are ridiculously large and had I known that I would have split an entree with the boyfriend.  Food quality is just ok, nothing that would make me seek out this place a second time.  The house salad and the cheesecake were the standouts of the meal.  The chicken tristina was swimming in some sort of flavorless watery sauce and the chicken parm pasta was not good."
0,"So said, it used ot be a British pub and was god, good food, good service. Went there friday night with a groupon, thank goodness!!!   We had to wait to be seated although there were tables open, wait to order, wait 15 or more minutes for a beer from tap, wait for food, scavenge hunt for ketchup. So So sad how this place went downhill so quickly. Being a local, I could go back and could recommend, but we wont and wont.  Just say no and dont go!!!"
4,Ohhhh wow did not expect this place to be all that great but of course I was wrong haha. The line is super fierce but of course def worth it ;)
2,"We came here out of curiosity because we couldn't tell what the place was and the name was kind of cool after we figured out it wasn't \""mellow marshmellow\"". The place has a cool diner kind of feel and the logo looks like a mushroom that's high or on shrooms and it looked like they were known for their pizza. To our disappointment, there wasn't a whole lot of items with mushrooms on it, and wasn't until after our server told us there is a special mushroom pizza that isn't listed on the menu and it would also take about 30 minutes to prep. So we got the hummus appetizer which was pretty yummy and the special mushroom pizza that had i believe 5 types of mushrooms on it? It was really good, the crust especially, which tasted like honey wheat. We asked our server and he said it was the molasses they used on it. Definitely worth trying once, but I think there are other cool pizza places I would like to get around to trying too, so it's not really a place I'm dying to go back to. Really great service though! You should get the mushroom pizza if you go though"
0,"Absolutely terrible.  The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes. After 40 minutes I decided to check on how many people were left ahead of us. My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated.  Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you.  I explained what the other hostess told me.  No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting.  I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time.  Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate."
4,"Great salon!\n\nI stopped in SUPER last minute with soaking wet hair to try and have my hair and make up done for a dinner, I had no appointment and they took me right away even when I said I had to be done within two hours.  Jenny started right away with my hair - curled to perfection and then started on my full face of make up.\n\nI looked beautiful!  I need to start taking tips from her.\n\nI've never had my hair AND make up professionally done together so I don't know whether or not to say $115 was expensive.\n\nBut I loved it enough and it's right by my house so it's super convenient that I made another appointment the following week for make up again.\n\nDefinitely will return."
4,OK Surprise folks. We need to make this place stick around! Italian beef with that heavenly liquid cheese is great. Italian sausage is grilled which adds a nice nutty flavor. Fry's are just OK but the sandwiches are the stars here. And don't forget the giardinira!
1,This is a smaller buffet setting. Sometimes they have local $6.99 specials which maybe worth the wait in a long @$$ line. Everyone and their baby daddy's cousin is in line.\n\nThe taste and quality of the food is a bit disappointing. Definately not worth paying regular price. Go elsewhere.
1,"Went for a late dinner, service was very good, view spectacular but my dish was horrible.  I ordered Chicken Fettucini Alfredo.  The chicken was tough, like it had been boiled or maybe 3 days old, it was stark white with no grill marks and tasted old.  The sauce was not creamy tasting or fresh either..  The noodles were very thick.  My husband had lasagna and it wasn't too bad.  Over priced in my opinion.  This is our 3rd time to go and I've never really enjoyed it, why do they put breadsticks in a paper bag, its a beautiful restaurant, seems like they'd wrap them in a napkin and put in a basket..  Was hoping the 3rd time would be a charm but not this time..."
2,"Stopped in while passing through Madison. Definitely not your ordinary food court Chinese food. The menu is much more authentic and has an overwhelming amount of options. It reminds me of Hong Kong Noodle, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants back in Minneapolis. All of the dishes looked and smelled salty and delicious, just what I was craving. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were able to order off the lunch specials menu which featured many popular items from the menu at a very decent price. We split an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and also an order of Red Curry Chicken. The dishes came out fast and looked mouthwatering. The Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of flavor and included peanuts (one of my favorite parts) and some sort of chile but no other vegetables. The chicken seemed poor quality. It felt a little mushy and slightly slimy. I don't think it tasted as good as it looked, I got a little sick of that dish by the end. The red curry chicken was not fried and the the chicken looked and tasted of much better quality. The curry came with the chicken along with an assortment of vegetables all covered in the red curry sauce. The curry tasted good but lacked enough flavor, I thought the dish could have been a little more powerful. Those are my favorite curries. It was a good cheap lunch if you're looking for some Chinese in the area."
4,"A hole in the wall next to the Daily Dose. Very small yet I love the people here and very tasty crepes!\n\nNot your average upscale dining however it is a very homey place. Prices are a little high but then again, its Old Town Scottsdale, what can you expect?"
3,"Been here a few times, I usually just have the wings, hot and they are very tasty. Service was pretty quick and server seemed nice.  Its always nice and fresh inside and there beer was cold.  I would reccomend this place to someone who just wants a relaxed sports bar.  most of the time ive gone its not too packed.  \n\n4**** stars!"
4,Yummy!!
4,"Tonight I decided to stop by one of the local newer places that I have been to in the past. Today is was K-bop. I have eaten here several times in the past. I have had nothing but positive experiences. Tonight I had to fend for myself with dinner as the family had prior plans. Eating at a place that offers fresh/healthier choices is always top of my list. \n\nTonight it was rather slow compared to the few other times. Which def ment that the service was rocken! My waitress was very attentive, she stopped by several times to check up on me, to make sure the water glass was filled and to see if I needed anything else. \n\nMy food was very delish! I started off with an order of the korean wings. I was very impressed. The wings where hot and juicy. Very fresh! The seasoning/sauce was sweet with a spicy kick to it. I was shocked that the wings was tossed with almond slices, but they was very tasty!  My main dish was was the Yakisoba. But I had them add Bulgogi. Nothing is better than noodles with some bulgogi. Everything was fresh and tasted outstanding. Tonight was the best flavors I have had. I think I might have found my favorite combinations... With these two dishes, I AM STUFFED!!!!! \n\nI am very glad that I live a few streets away from K-bop... I just wish I ate here more often..."
4,Delicious food and hearty portions. \nI go for the posole on the weekends. \nIn the restaurant now on a Sunday morning and every table has customers with a bowl of posole on it.
3,"Tiny restaurant, big potential.\n\nThe boyfriend and I decided to use my Groupon for lunch on Saturday and we couldn't have made a better choice. Centurion has a laid back atmosphere perfect for sitting outside and having a leisurely lunch. When we got there, there was only one other table sat so luckily we were able to grab a spot in the shade. They have a nice big canopy over their patio to help cut down on the direct sun. The inside looked cute (tiny, but cute) but outside was the place to be.\n\nWe started off with the baked brie. It comes wrapped in a pastry shell with jam inside and grapes on the side. Warm, gooey brie with jam? How could you go wrong? I ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich and boyfriend went for the tenderloin sandwich. Both came with salad on the side.\n\nMy sandwich was really good. The bread was fresh and it was loaded with shrimp and crab. I ordered it without dijon and it did feel like it could have used something else on it. But overall I liked it. Boyfriend felt the same way about his sandwich - good but needed a little something to make it great.\n\nThe side salad was very good. it was spinach with blackberries and a blackberry dressing. Simple but good. But then again I'm a big fan of spinach, too.\n\ni could see this place becoming quite the hot spot. Like I said, big potential. I think if they fine tuned a few things it could be really, really good. I recommend checking it out now before you have to wait for hours to get a table."
1,"exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!"
1,"I don't understand why everyone loves this place. I went in with high hopes because of all the great reviews and recommendations from friends. We walked in, the place was totally empty and no server in sight. No music just a TV playing the food channel. After an awkward silent min a server comes out the back. Our server was totally awkward.  When the food was ready he literally brought one thing out at a time. The food was soooo boring. The blandest Indian food I have ever eaten. Maybe it's just the vegetarian items that is so tasteless?"
4,"Came here for a lunch party! All I can say is amazing! Everything from the ambiance, location, setting, service and food!! I'm from Cali and can't wait to come back to AZ to come again! \n\nYou taste the freshness and quality in every bite!! I can't wait to come back for more!!\n\nI loved the sweet owner and her awesome son that made our experience unforgettable! \n\nIf your in AZ and you don't come here you def missing out"
4,Great food at a reasonable price. I have been there a couple of times now and will return. Nothing fancy but good service and tasty pitas. I've had the chicken shawarma and the BBQ chicken. Yum!
1,Just saw a sign on the window that said Cafe Euro is leaving as of 11/19/10 and Damon's will be opening up there.  Interesting....should be a good spot before Penguins games!
4,"Lucci's does the best gluten-free pizza I've ever tasted.  It is indistinguishable from a \""regular\"" wheat-based pizza.  I doubt many people could tell the difference.  Great staff and service too.  I LOVE LUCCI'S"
3,"Let's just make this clear, this restaurant has been opened for a year, but it has been under new management since three months ago. So, any reviews prior to three months ago should be read with precaution. \n\nWith that said, I drive past this restaurant at least twice a day going to and from work everyday. So my brother and I decided on some pasta today, so I thought we give this place a try - halfheartedly. \n\nThere was one other party in the restaurant when we walked in. Kind of nervous. The menu was not too extensive but enough to a sense that the kitchen is good at whatever it offers. \n\nI had the linguine and clams, and my brother had the lunch special with fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken. The lunch special comes with either soup of the day or salad. He had the soup, which was tomato basil. We were served toasted french bread while he had his soup. I tried a spoonful, and it was decent. I have had better. \n\nOur food arrived, and the server spilled some of the sauce from my dish onto the table. Not too big of a deal, but could be worked on. \n\nFirst bite into my linguine, and it was delicious! You can really tell it is freshly made. The clams were bigger than I expected, and the dish had true seafood taste. I was delightfully surprised! \n\nI tried the fettuccine alfredo, and the fettuccine was even better than my linguine! I say this because of the way linguine is, and the pasta kind of soaked up the sauce so it was soggier than I would have liked (still pretty good though). The fettuccine had a wonderful chewiness to it. The alfredo was as light as it can be since alfredo sauce can be quite heavy. \n\nOverall, the pastas were awesome! Fresh, chewy and flavorful. Oh, and the portions were huge!!! I will definitely come back to support this local business and for fresh pasta!"
3,"Beautiful and modern decor. I love the dark wood everywhere that fits well with the entire Aria look and feel. The food and presentation was great. I love tapas because you get a small portion and many plates. \n\nThe most memorable dishes was the flat iron steak, chicken and mushrooms and the churro with spicy chocolate. YUM!\n\nOur waiter was extremely accommodating and comped our dessert. The manager even offered to have my girls and I to come back and have a round of drinks comped. Sold! =D"
4,I absolutely love Tony's work. He fulfill everything I wanted in my tattoo. He is an amazing artist. I would recommend him to my family and friends.
4,"reasonable prize, gave good inputs regarding my yard, honest and hard working guy"
0,"People reviewing this place are drunk.  The one thing that can be said is that the portions are big.  That's it.  Service  is terrible and is VERY slow.  The signature dish of chicken and waffles was TERRIBLE.  The chicken is so dry and bland that you literally have to drink water just to wash it down.  It was honestly one of the worst breakfasts that I have ever paid for.  Breakfast is one of the most difficult meals to screw up, but these guys managed to do it."
2,"Average in every way, Don Pedro reminds me of a place my cousins love in Texas. It's as white-America as you can get with still having Hispanic people work at your restaurant.\n\nCheesy decor? Check!\n\nBig menu with essentially 10 items rearranged? Check!\n\nWaiter that hits on me in front of my mom and sister? Check, and GROSS!\n\nSeriously, this place is OK but do yourself a favor and come on down to Central Ave and East Charlotte - I promise you there are 2873298362879632 places that are better, fresher, more authentic and less likely to sexually harass you."
1,"The gas prices at this Circle K are always on the cheaper side (at least as far as gas is concerned).  It's also conveniently located on the way to downtown Phoenix, just south of the I-10, to and from my way to work.  But, the layout of the parking lot makes this one of the most inconvenient gas stations to fill up at.\n\nFirst problem;  There's only four pumps, all of which are located in the corner of the lot.  If there's one car using the pumps on either side, it's a major challenge to drive around them.  If the only free pump is facing the wrong way for your gas tank, maneuvering around the parking lot to face the right way is also a tough challenge.  Plus, on at least one occasion, another driver swooped in and stole my pump while I was trying to do this.  You really have to get lucky, or make some very quick decisions about how to enter the gas station while you're driving towards it.\n\nSecond problem;  The tiny parking lot.  I understand that space is limited, but between the gas situation, and people trying to pick up a drink or a snack from the shop, just driving to a parking space can be a headache.\n\nThird problem;  Ghetto.  I'm a 32 year old man and I am uncomfortable stopping by this Circle K when the sun is not out.  The location is being renovated, but that doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of seedy people hanging around this part of town."
3,"Stayed for 1 night. The check-in line was very long, waited for 30-40 minutes. The room was awesome, we paid for 2 queens with a street view on the 20th floor. The buffet brunch is around 30$, dinner is 40$, so we ended up going to McDonalds, that is right across the street, where we paid 30$ for 5 meals :). The casino and bar are clean, nice, a bit crowded. The bar server was very nice and the service was fast. :) They have Starbucks on the second floor, and a few coffee places downstairs. \n\nTo our surprise, when we were checking out, we were charged  almost 50$ for some refreshments that we never had. But took a phone call to resolve the issue (gonna check my credit card in a few days just to be sure they took the charges off). So make sure you are not charged for anything extra. I provided my @ address to check out, so they sent me an @ in the morning with the bill to review. So far, the experience is great! Looking forward to stop here again sometimes in the future. \n\nThe only concern throughout the whole trip: looks like Las Vegas is turning into Beijing. 75% of all people there - are Chinese?!?! My family is multiracial and we have no racial issues with anyone, but we were surprised to see so many Chinese faces around. Even the check-in line in Aria had at least 70% Chinese guests."
3,The closest u can get here for an authentic italian pizza... Be aware u may not like it if u think u r getting lot of cheese of ingredients... But that is the italian way
2,Excellent Service.  We had the Bison Steak which was excellent.  The mascarpone mashed potatoes were awesome.  But the prices and the atmosphere could be better considering you have to walk through the whole casino just to get to it.
0,"I've been there twice with the same friend, both of us female, early 30's.  The only thing good about this place is the atmosphere/decor.  The food was 50% good- half of the things we ordered were decent (not fantastic), the other half were unimpressive, at best.  But the worst part is not the food.  It is the service.  Both times we've been there, the bartenders (two different ones) have been very unattentive, if not completely rude, when \""serving\"" us (if you can call it that).   We had to get their attention to order, even though they were not waiting on anyone else.  They were uninterested in any type of conversation about what was on the menu, or what types of drinks are available.  They seemed to be completely put out that we were there, and made us feel like they were doing us a favor by even waiting on us.  And they were not busy when we were there.  One time the bar was half full.  The second time, we were literally the only ones there.  There were maybe two other tables seated in the entire place.  \nDo yourself a favor-- go to Ibiza next to Mallorca if you want tapas.  The food it wonderful, the atmosphere is intimate, the wine list is better, and the service is impeccable."
0,This was the nastiest so called resort I have ever stayed in the rooms are nasty house keeping don't clean shit every thing was filthy . The management  don't care about customer service. We complained to them they didn't do anything about the house keeping. I would not recommended this place to anyone ever.
3,"I love the food at Sa-Bai Thong. People can debate, but they had me at scallion dumplings.\n\nThere were more shrimp in the Tom Kha on the west side, and was it just me or was the pork a little more flavorful?\n\nThe service, as always, is unpredictable. \n\nThe space is less intimate here than the mutiple booths that break up the one on University. But there is a nice framed view."
2,"A nice place for lunch, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and good hospitality."
4,I eat here often.  They have great customer service and quality food.
0,This place sucks. The food is horrible. I just moved here from Long Island and I am not impressed at all. I guess you guys have never had good Chinese food.
2,"I came here for dinner with some friends the other night to try out the much talked about stuffed pizza served here. Walking in we were greeted and taken to a table. The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.\n\nAfter ordering a \""1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza\"" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered \""Cheesy Garlic Bread\"" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! \n\nNow let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. \n\nOut front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available."
3,"Great place for a Sunday brunch if you don't mind waiting a while for a seat. This place is delicious and popular but very packed. We waited longer than we would have liked, but once we were seated the service was great and the food was delicious."
0,"Ugh. Cesspool of a college bar, the only place at which I was ever, as far as I can tell, overtly discriminated against on the basis of (perceived) sexual orientation.\n\nI stopped in for a quick happy hour drink with two friends, one a lesbian, one bisexual; all three of us \""look\"" non-heterosexual to a certain extent. Anyway, we paid for this; the old guy tending bar pointedly ignored us, at one point literally ignoring our polite \""Excuse me\""s to wait on a cute blonde in the OTHERWISE EMPTY BAR. \n\nI am not eager to ever return."
1,"Three of us stopped by Humble Pie on Friday, March 28 at around 4 pm.  There were quite a few people on the patio, but we decided to sit inside.  There were only a couple of tables filled inside.  We ended up sitting at a table next to a high-top table in front of the kitchen.  I thought it a bit strange that the whole high-top table was filled with unfolded napkins and tableware.  There was a waitress sitting there putting the silverware in the napkins and folding them.  I thought this was a bit strange, being right in front of everyone.  A little bit later, I saw her take a bite of pizza.  Upon watching her a bit closer, I saw that she was actually taking a bite of pizza and then going back to handling the silverware and folding napkins.  This certainly was not the most appetizing.  A couple of minutes later, another waiter came out with food, sat down next to her (and the silverware and napkins) and proceed to eat his food!  About 15 minutes later a gentleman came into the dining room and talked to both of them.  I assume that he was either the manager or owner, because he was telling them that a VIP was coming on Saturday, and they were not to post anything about it on Facebook.  He then proceeded to sit at the bar with a drink and talk to the bartender.  We felt like we were in the middle of a employee party and they forgot to tell us.  As we were sitting only three feet away, we really didn't feel comfortable commenting about what we were eating or even talking among our selves.  I had the Grilled BLT sandwich.  The bacon was very smoky and tasty.  I was surprised that the toasted sourdough bread that was used came to the table and was actually cold.  I don't know if my plate was finished before the rest of the order, but I was expecting at least a warm, toasted piece of sourdough bread.  \n\nI had previously eaten at the Humble Pie on 7th Street and was very impressed with their facility.  I was disappointed with my experience at this location.  I believe the preparation of the silverware and napkins should be done away from guests and definitely not when the person preparing them is taking a bit of pizza."
1,"The price is good for what you get and for the convenience (if it's ready). It's not anything to write home about but it's decent for $5. When the pizza is ready, it's nice to just come in and have it already done but I find the problem is at peak times, like dinner, the pizzas aren't ready. Umm...ok? I come at dinner time and it's a 15-20 min wait for a \""hot and ready\"" pizza. I understand it's a busy time but shouldn't you take that into account and forecast how many you'll need when you are making pizzas for the peaks? Otherwise, stop calling it hot and ready when it's not! Kind of defeats the purpose of me coming to little Caesars versus a competitor. It's not like I pick this place over other pizza joints because it tastes better..."
1,What happened to this place? I ordered my usual extra crispy sesame chicken and mushy yuckyness with  bland yet sweet syrupy sauce is what I received. \n\nI was given no choice between fried rice and white rice and they automatically assumed I wanted the large portion when I actually would have wanted the small if I knew I had the option ( I just thought the prices went up...and truthfully there was no difference in size and it use to be $6.95 now its $10.95!). I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap? \n\nThe usually amazing   crab rangoon wasn't hot enough (temp-wise) and I was totally disappointed.They also forgot to give me my chop sticks which may be a small thing but I specifically asked for them. The literally gave us a full pint of duck sauce though so perhaps they should think of scaling down there and throwing in a veggie egg roll like they use to.  \n\nThey use to have 5 stars from me but this last time wasn't even worth a single star in my opinion so  I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give them a 2.5 ...I really am not sure if I would return if the quality has gone that downhill...search is back on for good take-out Americanized Chinese food in Charlotte
4,"I have been coming here for years. The owner is really great--I found him with a friend when we came to his shop from another one next door where they tried to tell us that his car would be about $2500 to fix.  The owner fixed it for about $40.  I never feel like I'm being pressured...there really isn't any upsell, unless something truly needs to be fixed.  Highly recommend!"
2,"Big supermarket catering for the businesses and Asian population of Edinburgh. Very easy to find and great selection of frozen, dried and canned food. From all over China and the other asian regions. I have not noticed that they actually lack of certain products or brands, but I did notice that the selection tends to change and indeed the 'commercial' westernised Asian brands are taking up more shelf space - but I guess that is a reaction to 'what sells' in Scotland.. Try looking at the upper and lower shelf spaces and you'll find that similar sort of product but cheaper :o)\nThey are very helpful, friendly and patient (when you try to speak Chinese they even try to pretent you do it well)\n\nbecause they more cater for the bulk buyer then the individual I have to take of a few stars.. I really wouldn't know what to do with 1kg of 5 spice and 10kg of Basmati.."

3,"I came too REI after calling the store looking for Garmin Triathlon bundle. The salesperson looked into the stock and told me had four of them in stock. Unfortunately when I did arrive there was mistake on the computer or glitch really had none of them in stock. =( As always no matter the store REI customer service is always five stars. I had numerous employees asked me if needed help the whole time shopping and once the employee looking for he Garmin realize out apologize. If they out of stock they more then happy too call the other REI store here in Vegas see if they have it in stock. Or if all fails always go too the website and depending on the item usually ships for free. REI it has nice variety of outdoor products from hiking, camping, too the main reason come too the store for triathlon needs and easily best section comes too energy products. GU, Honey Stingers, and list goes on and on. I like the fact very organized and they have ALL the flavors for the most part. The prices depends some things are pricey and other things not so bad. If you sign up for the yearly membership they have random annual sales that cane find steal of deals and end of the year get money back depends on the amount of money you spend. Also need too spend $12 too maintain the lifetime membership each year. They carry mostly top end brands always good thing if looking for quality. If looking for anything outdoor needs REI is the only place you need too shop at."
0,"I was expecting much better service for what I was spending. My server was basically nonexistent. Both my salad and entree didn't have the bacon that was promised on the menu and i had to ask for it on the side. I didn't receive drink service in a timely manner, about 20-30 minute intervals. I received the wrong drink then had I wait 20mins to have it corrected. I had to wait 10 minutes after my friends got their food to receive mine and then my filet was undercooked. My girlfriends grouper was overcooked and dry with the wrong pasta. Our server did not check on us after our food was delivered. After our main course was taken away we waited over 40 minutes for our dessert choices, after all of our friends had already paid! Then we were told we should get our dessert to go because everyone else was... due to the horrible service. Not satisfied spending over $100 for this. There's much better restaurants for less money."
0,The food here is always great.. My review today is regarding the delivery. I feel a little bad posting this.. But at the same time.. Standards have to be in place. The delivery driver who brought me my order reeked of urine... Not animal ... It was so unappetizing. I could not even eat what I ordered a complete waste of $30!!!  For a person to approach my door in that state with food... How can this be? He is in the restaurant picking up the food to deliver.. Do the other employees and owners not smell this? If i can smell it while he is outside my door... how can no one there not smell this? How could standards be so low?... I'm so turned off by this..
3,"Got the stuff I need, and oftentimes more, but (I'm sure you saw THAT coming), I can never find 550 paracord...its the stuff those cool survival bracelets are made of. \n\nLeatherman tools, top dollar binocs, Pantagonia clothes, great boots, all the stuff you need in high quality, but no good rope. They have only the cheap stuff, which is a surprise to me, being they carry everything else one would need for climbing, hiking and camping.\n\nOh well, back to the shack. Hopefully REI can stay competitive in all the other gear I so relied on REI for...that is, before I moved back to AZ, and now have the shack just down the street!"
2,"It's the day before Thanksgiving and if I have to drive grandma to get stuffed, I better do it in a clean car. I drove up and spoke with Staten Island Tracy. I told her I wanted the $65 dollar special, she told me it would take until 6p, I dropped my car off at 1p.\n\nGot a call telling me my car was done at 4p. Stoked I go and pick up my car. The guys are cool, Staten Island Tracy is nice.  Bonus it was done early and I tipped her and Eric's crew fairly well; told them not to smoke in bed.\n\nHowever, I just spent $65+tip and my windows had streaks and smudges. My interior was clean a dust free, looked really good. Just disappointing they didn't wipe down my windows before I left.\n\nMaybe they were thinking of Football, Turkey, pumpkin pie and all the fixings. Next time I'm staying and watching the whole time."
2,"Not worth the trip.  Barely worth stopping if you are passing by and hungry.\n\nHarold's Corral is a large vaguely western-themed eatery with a clean but cavernous main restaurant and patio seating made less enjoyable by the adjacent very dusty parking lot.  \n\nThe food is standard western fare.  For lunch I had a burger and my wife had a beef BBQ sandwich.  They were okay - maybe the burger was a little better than average, but the less than crisp fries made up for it.  \n\nPrices are pretty high for a burger joint and this ain't no fine dining restaurant.  Three stars says it perfectly."
2,"The pizza is always good, but the service is never friendly. Whether I call in an order or place in person I have yet to see one worker at the counter smile! I would like a smile with my pizza please!"
3,"Fast, efficient and friendly service.  My spa pedicure included an amazing hot rock calf massage.  Polish lasted a good 3 weeks before chipping."
1,"Ce St-Hubert est \u00e0 \u00e9viter si vous d\u00e9tester les files d'attendes et les endroits surpeupl\u00e9s. Oui, le resto est bien plac\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de Centre Bell, mais tout le monde s'y pr\u00e9cipite pour une bouffe rapide avant un match ou un concert. Je suis venu ici avec 3 autres personnes dans l'espoir de manger vite, mais le service a prit 45 minutes avant d'apporter nos assiettes. Le serveur, compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9pass\u00e9 par les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, trouvait des excuses pour tout. Il a m\u00eame bl\u00e2m\u00e9 un manque de patates frittes aux cuisines pour expliquer le d\u00e9lais dans nos commandes ! Lamentable !

3,"Love the mozzarella sticks and the chicken tender wraps, I get it with grilled chicken and Tk sauce, mmmm delicious! Been eating it for years! Love Taylor she's a fire cracker"
0,"This place is horrible and over priced for what it is! Their hash plates consist of over salted potatoes with your choice of side dumped on top of them. Not  cooked in like a hash should be. The potatoes seemed like they are the kind you get out of a frozen bag. My eggs were cold, biscuit was ok. You know it's a bad place when the waiters don't even ask you how their food is because they know it sucks! My husband and I spent $34 for breakfast but the food was so shitty we were still hungry after we left!"
4,"Service used to be incredibly slooooooow...we stopped going since we cant afford two hours dinners. But improved since. My  favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant, its my daughter & I's special place where we get to spend some quality time over food we both enjoy most! She's ten, her favorite is California Roll, Deep Fried Gyoza, Edamame and mine are Salmon Skin Roll, Agedashi Tofu, Cucumber Salad and we both love the Spider Roll (soft shell crab). And she also loves the Japanese Sprite which was introduced to her since Osaka Restaurant's days. For a good sushi in henderson, this is Z place..."
4,"This past weekend after many trips to Vegas    Me and my family stayed at the Tropicana. For the 1st time. Upon arrival you can see the changes a completely new look on the out side, the new logo is fresh and trendy.  The inside is even better the check in area looks modern and very cool, the casino floor and over all of the entire place looks great The rooms are good looking the pool area is really nice. over all the new tropicana is well thought out in design great job. \""On a side note\"" the only thing we dislike is the check in time we arrive into Vegas around 9:30am from a long 3.5hr drive from Los Angeles. It would be nice if there's a way management can accommodate those who have already reserved rooms to make their trips easy and more pleasant, because not everyone gets into Vegas at the require time for check in witch is set 3pm. It's my believe if there's a way to accommodate people who arrive early they'll keep coming back."
1,"We were really looking forward to trying this place. The food is so-so. Doubt I'll be craving it. We had ziti, fettuccine Alfredo and linguine principessa (shrimp and clams). The shrimp was rubbery. Garlic bread was good but gets hard as a rock if you don't eat it asap. (Microwaved??) The walls had spots where paint was rubbed off. I can honestly say the waitress was arrogant and made us feel like she was doing us a favor by serving us."
1,Dude i have never heard of a starbucks with a bad rating untill now.  i wanna give it 2.5 stars.  Just because the line was long and it's not there fault.  I sat on a small nice looking sofa seat untill i looked closer.. its dirty and kinda tore up.  The place does not take the starbucks card for some reason. and my latte was kinda burnt.  maybe just a bad day.. well from all the review and the star rating it been a bad forever.  oh i didn't get wifi.
0,"Terrible! I threw the majority of my order away. The soup was inedible. The sushi turned my stomach. I'm still hoping I'm not going to get sick from this experience. \nThe service was fast, though."
0,"I have had a policy with Matt for over 5 years now for my car. I tried adding my husband to my policy and he had problems with his license and so I told them not to worry about adding him. So without notifying me that my own policy would be cancelled, they terminated it. Since I was on autopay for 5 years, I had no idea until the DMV sent me a fine for lapsed coverage for $500. Matt and his staff gave me the runaround for a few days and refused to admit it was their fault. I kept getting told that they would call me back, and I would have to call back every time. Now I just sent him an email from the same email I have always used to cancel my remaining rental insurance policy (which he had no problems still charging me for) and had the nerve to respond with \""who is this?\"" wow. just wow. That is how you treat a long term client? with zero at fault accidents?? he used to be nice until he screwed me over.  I never get upset over bad service, but this is costing me a lot of unnecessary money. Look elsewhere for an agent who will let you know they are cancelling your policy to avoid fines."
4,"Wow! Red velvet pancakes were awesome! The service was great, the portions were large and the food was awesome! We have lived in Las Vegas for a few years and have been looking for great breakfast places and this one hot the mark. So excited to eat there again!"
0,This place was nasty... I wouldn't eat here ever again... It cost 60$ for 2 people and the food isn't worth 5dollars ... I would have rather ate at McDonald's ...
4,"I have been wanting to try the Black Dog for some time and finally had the chance after a day of golf. Arrived at 4:45 and thought we would get right in. Wrong, waited about 10 minutes. This is a good sign with that many people there at this time of day during the week. \n\nWaiter was knowledgeable, friendly and provided great service. It only got better from there. Ordered the three meat combo of burnt ends, brisket and ribs. I have to say the burnt ends were my favorite, but they all were perfectly cooked and the taste was outstanding. I went with the Carolina Red sauce and it had just enough zip in it. I was pleasantly surprised with their choice of beers and IPA's. I went with a tough to find Dog Fish Head Brown Ale on tap. \n\nI will be back Black Dog very soon. Nice work!"
1,"Good location BUT beware...the pictures on the web are MUCH nicer than the resort. Understaffed resort that looks like it was likely built as a time share resort in the 1980's. Needs updating all the way around. Good price  BUT don't forget ...\""you get what you pay for\""."
0,"I would see the show again, but I've vowed to never again visit the restaurant. Despite making a reservation, we weren't seated on time. We had to ask the hostess to wait at one of the two hidden bars to enjoy outrageously priced cocktails. We had to wave down our waiter three times for water, cocktail refills and the bill. The service was so slow that the dinner took 105 minutes (and that's without an appetizer or dessert). The policy of the restaurant was to let both or neither of us order off the his/her price fix menu; only one of us wanted it, but that was not allowed. The waiter actually discouraged us from ordering dessert. The noise was loud, so we were yelling along with other patrons just to carry a conversation. Good food + terrible service + vague descriptions + pretentious vibe = failed social experiment!"
0,"STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!\n\nEvery. Single. Time. Anyone in my family or I have taken our vehicles in to get work done, they do a horrible job, and then somehow something else goes wrong that hadn't previously been wrong. One time our battery died magically because the workers left our lights on, so we got a free battery out of it. I guess I can commend them for realizing it was their fault and fixing it for free, but their way of business is to replace whatever needs to be replaced with crappy parts and they charge you an arm and a leg for it all. \n\nThis is absolutely the worst car shop in Charlotte."
1,"Pas de 5 \u00e0 7, bar familial beaucoup d'enfants. Je trouve cela beaucoup trop cher pour ce que c'est... En plus, le service que j'ai re\u00e7u \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.

3,"My husband and I had ordered-in once, out of sheer laziness and the desire to try something new. We had the red thai curry and rice and were pleasantly surprised with how delicious it was. So we made a lunch visit & had 2 options from the stir-fried menu. For starters, the restaurant is a small cozy one, almost homely. Service is excellent, and this coming from me (read, stickler for good service). Our server was a young cheerful girl and not only helped me choose between a few options (read: good knowledge about the food), but was pleasant, engaging, yet non-interfering. For $9 each we had a sumptuous meal of an iced tea, warm non-heavy soup, and just the right size for a side of chicken with veges, white rice and a golden crispy egg roll. My only complaint was the size of the plate was a tad small. But nothing that spoiled our experience. My husband & I are new to Charlotte and eat out a lot. Monsoon Thai, we both agreed, is a GOOD discovery!"
4,"Sweet!   Gal pals and I stumbled in hereafter a long lunch.  Perfect swimsuits for the Roman Styled Bellagio pool!  We wrapped ourselves in sarongs of turquoise and gold.  I have since returned to Capri each time Ifind myself inVegas.  The sale rack can,t be beat, and the salesladies know their stock!\nI got a perfect charming yet sophisticated faux chinchilla and embroidered vest for my fashionista Mom for Christmas!  I scored a Michael Kors camouflage top covered in transparent sequins last summer that Paraded around all over Europe last summer, casual, yet iconic.  I am hoarding a blue and white Ikat pattern top to pull out for the first summer breeze, along with a tiered white skirt.\nPerfect mix of siren and classic to bringoutthegoddess in you!"
1,"I went to Brio with my new employeer on my first day at work.  It is within walking distance of our office.  I have returned twice since that first visit.  \nThe food is overpriced.  I got the chicken arriabiatta sandwich, and while it was good there was some less-than-great quality chicken in there.  The desserts are perfectly sized for lunch (espresso cup-sized for $2).  It is almost impossible to resist dessert when it's that cheap and that small.\nWe have also tried the pork chop, the tuna appetizer, and an omelet at brunch - all items were good, but too pricey to be worth it.\nI'll save this one for when I'm using the expense account."

4,beautiful =)\n\nbut .. the suites are not suites. We booked the Sky Suites where you go up through a different entrance and you feel like a super hero because you pass all this security and big doors .. but the rooms are regular size!! boooo\n\nbut i still give you 5 stars baby =)
4,Best breakfast in the Valley!!  We go weekly.  We like the home fries and country eggs Benedict.
1,"My taco tasted just like KFC.  Mixteca somehow found out the Colonel's secret recipe and put it on the taco meat.  While it may actually sound kind of good, no, it wasn't.  \nThe food wasn't very good overall, it was maybe good in the bland 'bertos-esque way that some people seem to like.  The food just wasn't cheap enough to explain away the bland and terrible taste of it.  For the two of us it was barely under $20 and we didn't even each get our own drink.  \nThe highlight of the meal was the drink we shared.  We got a canteloupe/watermelon drink that was off the chain.  Saved themselves from a 1 star review with that gem.\nIt was crowded and not friendly."
0,"We have a regular go to when it comes to breakfast but had heard good reviews about Biscuits on Gilbert Road. After several attempts to coax my daughter into trying something new we decided on Biscuits for brunch this morning. Wow, what a mistake. Not only were my biscuits, which I think that's what they're known for by their name, so stale and hard that I could not even cut them , my daughter found a long twisted hair throughout her food. Needless to say we were both utterly disgusted and the waitress contacted the manager on our behalf. He basically just said \""this has never happened before and I'm very sorry\"". I find it very hard to believe that we were singled out for this bad service. We left without eating and on our way out our waitress came up to me and told me that she was embarrassed about the whole situation. It certainly was not her fault, definitely a management issue. I cannot understand the good reviews as our FIRST and ONLY experience was HORRIBLE. Needless to say we will never go there again and I am definitely going to pass this on."
4,We just love this place- the food is excellent!  Service is the best!
2,Just your average sandwich.\n\n1. Okay prices. $5.99 for a toasted ciabatta sandwich.\n\n2. Except for the pricey bottled water. $2.50 for the water. Wtf? Go across the hall to the convenience store in the mall. It's 99 cents for a bigger bottle.\n\n3. No wheat options at all for either the wraps or the sandwiches.
3,"When we arrived at Terra, we were warmly greeted by a  happy, smiling man.  Not sure if he was the owner, manager or chef, but it was as if he was welcoming us into his own home.  And what a lovely, cozy place it is.  The lighting was perfect, and French cafe music played in the background. \nOur server offered us samples of the wines by glass.  We settled on the montepulciano, which was a bit like a Cabernet Sauvignon.  We were given an amuse-bouche, which was a smoked fish spread on a crostini.  I don't typically eat fish, and It tasted a little fishy to me, so my husband devoured both of our servings.  We were served bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Very enjoyable, and the server spontaneously brought extra bread.\nWe both ordered the scallops served atop spinach and cheese ravioli.  The presentation was beautiful.  Rare for me to order seafood, but these scallops were perfectly seared and seasoned.  The ravioli needed a bit of salt.  I did note that this restaurant is not too proud to have  salt and pepper shakers on the table.  An appreciated touch.\nThe happy, smiling man who greeted us checked on us to see how we were enjoying our evening.  We were all smiles.  What a charming place."
3,"Note:  4 stars for the gambling, since I have nothing to say about the accomodations...\n\nWe stayed at the MGM, but came to Tropicana for the gambling.  $5 craps and blackjack = GOOD TIMES and leaving a little less poor than the slightly  more expensive tables at other casinos.  Plus, the dealers were all very helpful (the intricacies of craps are *ridiculous*) and the ventilation was so fantastic that I couldn't smell a cigarette unless I was unlucky enough to be standing next to one.  But then again it's Vegas, so coming out of a casino smelling like cigs, cloves, and booze only means that you enjoyed yourself.\n\nAnd I did.  At the Tropicana."
4,"I just got my prescription sunglasses today and am very VERY happy with them.  Finding the right pair of glasses is difficult for me because of my wider face and nose bridge and my stupid strong prescription.  I actually did find a fantastic pair several years ago in Arizona but those frames developed a crack and would not allow the lenses to be changed out without destroying the frames.  Thus, the hunt for new sunglasses to protect my eyes from the evil desert sun.  I did not have high hopes for finding frames that were as comfortable and pretty as my old ones.  I started my search by visiting a few other shops in the city.  Nothing.  Boo.  Where should I go next?\n\nAfter reading Bobby Y's glowing review and after numerous trips to Sunglass Optic Studio, I decided to invest in a pair of SALT frames.  Now, I should mention that I'm frugal by nature (i.e., cheap) and eyewear is not (cheap, that is.  At least for me!).  The fact that I chose to purchase a pair of frames from this shop speaks volumes.  Sunglass Optic Studio, hereby referred to in this review as SOS, carries a wide range of fashion forward frames with the accompanying price tag.  Not all are break-the-bank expensive, but the brands displayed attest to the quality of the shop.  When I tried on my SALT frames for the first time, I was so thrilled because they FIT right out of the box....er, display case....No adjustment needed!!!!!  Daren (the optician) was super patient as I compared the SALT frames with my old ones, poring over the fit and angle to see the difference.  I was sold.\n\nIf you want great service and even better glasses, come here and try a pair on for yourself.  I was told that my frames would arrive by Friday (i.e., tomorrow), but they arrived yesterday.  My actual lenses look \""normal\"" and \""thin\"" in the frames due to some fancy wizardry (i.e., \""digital imaging\"" -- stretching out the lenses whilst keeping the prescription intact) instead of having the edges of the lenses rising above the frame (evidence of lesser quality lens making).  SOS calls you when they say they will and follows through on what they say they will do.  Integrity is a scarce commodity, it seems, in the retail industry but from what I've experienced, is plentiful at SOS.\n\nJust a note: SOS does not take insurance.  A bit of a pain, but after asking, they said they'd rather spend their time and money on quality products."
3,"Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay\nLV: Strip\nSaturday April 24, 2011\nFour Stars\n\n30 Minute Wait.  No Problem.  Slip the Hostess a $20 and the wait seemed to disappear.  I love Vegas b/c all propriety does not exist.  There was a great beer selection but I did not partake b/c I was already wrecked for the last few nights. The waitress filled my water glass at least 15 times. The Surf and Turf Burger was amazing.  The Build Your Own Burger was great too.  Thats all I really remember."
1,Not worth paying for. Make your own salad better and for less! It was clean- that's about all I can say for it...
3,"Great Sports Bar.  In Phoenix/Tempe for work and checked out a couple bars to watch the Laker, OKC, Miami, NY, Clipper games.  Aracadia Tavern quickly became our go to bar while we're in town.  \n\nDecor/layout:  4\nIt's a simple layout that works.  Multiple TV's on the walls and bar.  Not alot of other decoration to distract you.  Good spacing between tables and chairs never had to weave in and out to get to a table or restroom.  Nobody standing infront of the tables blocking TVs.  Great setup for watching a game and there was always a TV available for us to watch the games we wanted.\n\nService:  3.5\nI've had great service everytime I've been here.  Drinks always refilled without prompting.  The only knock i give them is for when we're watching a late game, once or twice our server seem disappeared and/or left without telling us.  We had to find someone else to give us our bill.  \n\nQuality/taste: 3.5\nGrilled wings tavern style are a must.  Delicious and meaty.  Great way to start a meal and the game.  First time we got them we had to get another order.  Now we usually get an order each when we go.\n\nBig Azz Nachos were tasty.  A lot of food and a decent ratio of elements.  It's typical barfood.  Can't go wrong with that. \n\nPrime Dip was just ok.  I wasn't a big fan, but wasn't the worst and wasn't the best beef dip i've had.  the prime rib had little taste the Au jus was like colored water and the meat wasn't piled on.  Very underwhelming.  \n\nChef Rob's slow cooked ribs were pretty tasty.  The meat was soft and juicy.  The sauce had a good flavor and had a little bite to it and not to sweet.  \n\nSweet Potato tater tots.  You can't go wrong with sweet tater tots.  \n\nPrice: 3\nOk priced food and drinks.  Haven't taken advantage of some of their daily specials (there's a wine and pizza day and other specials).  But they look good.  My company was paying for my meals so i wasn't paying too much attention to the prices.  It's definitely not the cheapest bar food you can get, but for the quality you get you're not breaking the bank.    \n\nMisc:  4\nParking can get crowded there.  You may have to valet it.  For those that don't like leaving their keys with people this could be a big negative.  Late night Trivia games are fun.  They were always willing to accomadate us for the games we wanted to watch."
0,This place is mediocre at best. I have been here so many times and it was delicious. Now not good. The last four times we were here it wasn't good in anyway. \n\nThe service from the moment we walked in the door was bad. They screwed up my salad and poured salt--they called it seasoning---all over it. Then the steak was way over cooked (I ordered medium). The fries were over cooked and crunchy. The water was never filled. They were terrible. I'm so disappointed. Eater beware this place is no good anymore.
4,"I went for lunch on my day off. Been wanting to try this place for a while. It's location right next to a head shop is a little dubious, but once you go in, no worries. \n\nThe inside is clean, nicely decorated; a few murals and TVs playing Bollywood. Indian restaurants always flaunt a fully stocked bar with top end whiskeys and scotch. Does anyone ever drink there? The staff was extremely polite. I was seated and went to the buffet.\n\nAll of the standard dishes were there. The food was fresh. The rice cooker with basmati in it had a cinnamon stick mixed in, I thought that was cool. Tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken curry , palak paneer (although it had baby corn in it instead, interesting), aloo gobi, and a few other veggie dishes. All tasted great. The dal was spicy, but in a warm way. The waiter brought garlic naan and tandoori chicken , which was excellent. \n\nI love the desserts. Gulab jamun, kheer , and mango custard. All delicious. There was also complimentary mango lassi, which missed. Everything was great, the servers were really on top of things without being pushy. I'll definitely make more stops here."
3,"This place is Good Mexican food!  Love the Taco Salad. My husband had the Chili Relleno, Enchilada, rice and beans. It was REALLY good too!!!  Yummy  Yummy Yummy"
2,Good food....sorry but I love Nirvana II more
2,"Food was good, service meh.\n\nI had the O.B.'s Pan Roast and Oysters Rockefeller.  Both were great!  Make sure to add pasta because the sauce from the pan roast is really good with on the pasta!\n\nA friend had the Bouillabaisse, which everybody thought tasted very bland.  I would not recommend getting this.\n\nAnother friend I believe had the classic shrimp scampi.  Once he got back to the hotel, it all came out the other end, undigested.  Same with another friend who had a bite of that same plate scampi.  Probably should avoid this dish as well.\n\nThe server seemed to be annoyed with us at the beginning for whatever reason.  At the time (around 5pm), there were only us (party of 8), and a party of 3, so the server's not swamped with work or anything.  We asked 3 times for a refill of bread (hungry drunk people), and it was never brought to us.  The server also made a mistake by ordering an extra pan roast, rather than the Bouillabaisse.  He allowed us to keep the pan roast though for free while he fixes his mistake.\n\nAll in all, -1 for annoyed server even though we weren't at all rude, and -1 for giving two of our party the runs."
1,"Atmosphere - five stars.  Food - two stars.  Value - zero stars.\n\nFig Tree is in a beautiful old home, and I think it is the prettiest (and most romantic) restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.  Sadly, spending time in the house requires that you eat the food - and that's not something you really want to subject yourself to...\n\nThere are some positives to mention about Fig Tree.  I have been there for dinner on two separate occasions.  Each time, the service was good.  At the first meal, our server was particularly attentive and friendly.  A HUGE positive in Fig Tree's favor is that they do try very, very hard to provide great customer service.  Before my first visit I called the restaurant to ask about vegetarian options.  I spoke with someone from the kitchen, and he assured me that they could provide options that were not on the menu.  I was very impressed.  \n\nI have also been very impressed with the wine/champagne that I have had at Fig Tree.  At the first dinner, we had a half bottle of Lang and Reed Cab. Franc.  It is really hard to find, and it is an incredible treat when I get the chance to have it.  The second dinner I went to was a champagne dinner, and the champagne pairings were wonderful.  \n\nSadly, the food at Fig Tree has been a major disappointment.  At my first meal, I ordered a special which included a steak and a crab cake.  The steak was mediocre.  There was very little flavor, and the quality of the meat seemed totally inappropriate for the type of restaurant that Fig Tree aspires to be.  (To be fair, my vegetarian companion enjoyed her pasta dish.)  If the steak was mediocre, then the crab cake didn't get close to being mediocre.  It was one of the worst crab cakes I have ever had - at any restaurant.  I was shocked.  On my second visit to Fig Tree a friend was treating me to a champagne dinner.  I literally can't remember a single course... Not a good sign for such a memorable event.  \n\nI feel as though I have to try Fig Tree one more time, for so many people seem to love this restaurant... But, for now, I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for a restaurant for a special evening."
1,"To be fair, it was a really crazy Friday night. I've worked at two different coffee shops before so I do know how frazzled you can get when you're swamped and understaffed/ under-equipped.\n\nThat being said, I had spent $3 for a $6 Groupon online for their store (the store would have had to register with Groupon for this to be available, I'm sure), and when I got there and handed it to them, they didn't know how to use it. Instead of subtracting the $6 from my order they didn't charge me for one of my drinks. She said \""I didn't charge you for the cappuccino, because with tax it would be over $3 anyway.\"" Then she asked me to pay for the small cup of hot tea and biscotti, which came to $4.42. So since I had already paid $3 online for this coupon, crediting me $2.50+tax for one drink didn't actually do anything at all. I didn't make a scene because the line was basically doubled up out the door. \n\nUnfortunately, to top it off, I had ordered an extra-dry decaf cappuccino (hate to be that annoying customer, but being a barista for 4+ years you can't help but figure out what you like =P) and I was handed a cup of black decaf coffee. I went back up and told them \""Excuse me, I'm sorry, this was supposed to be a decaf cappuccino,\"" and the woman apologized and started on my drink again. Her mother reminded her that it was supposed to be extra-dry and she acknowledged her. In the end I ended up with a latte with absolutely no foam. Not one ounce.\n\nThe building itself could be nice, if it weren't so crazy, though I do appreciate that they try to have things going on to liven up the atmosphere and set themselves apart from other coffee shops, it just wasn't for me.\n\nSo essentially, I got ripped off and never even got what I ordered. Kinda sucks; I don't have any plans to go back. Regardless, if it looks interesting to you, give it a shot; you may have a completely different experience than I did."
2,"After seeing a movie at the Imax in the mall we got hungry and wanted to wet our whistles with some drink, so we stopped in to check out Rock Bottom.  Rolling with a crew 4, we noticed the crowd was older, 50's/60's.  I ordered the fish and chips, husband order a steak dinner.  Friends order a albacore burger, and cheeseburger meal. All food was ok, except for the albacore burger.  It looked really weird, if it was albacore tuna it was burned to crap.  From what I saw it looked like it was brown almost like a veggie burger.  My friend said it tasted really funny so we made her complain to the waiter before eating any more of it.  Our waiter was very nice and apologized for the quality and said she could order any meal on the house.  She ended up getting mac and cheese and was happy with that.  We all got drinks but one of the star drink orders was a sampler of all their beers they brew.  For under 7 bucks you get like 8/4oz beers. In tasting glasses.   Good deal so you can get a great overall sample of what they've got to offer!"
2,"I like it.  I don't love it.  It needs work but shows promise as a premiere Old-Town lunch spot.  \n\nThis location is worth fighting for and good for them for occupying it.  It has that nestled in/hidden feeling that adds an adventurous ambience to what could have been just a standard lunch spot if put anywhere else.  The simply fresh menu mixed with the idea of fresh AZ cider about to hit your palette speaks to the soul.  Throw in their soon to be up and running soda bar and ice cream sundaes and you have a staple in Old-Town Scottsdale.  \n\nTried:  \n -Cider Mill Dip:  fresh classic take on a French Dip with homemade pasta salad. \n -Hot Apple Cider:  once this steamy treat cooled down, it was worth it. \n -Chili with Noodles, Cheese, Onion & Beans:  I was told this is referred to as \n   \""Cincinnati style.\""  Chili...on noodles?  It was good stuff and\neven a bit sweet to the taste.  \n\nSaw:   \n -Chop Salad (no lettuce):   Looked good but not my cup of tea.  \n\n\nEverything was good....not great.  The service felt like it was their first day of business.  So basically, there was no service or mood or energy in the place but as soon as they figure that out (and they will) this place will be good to go."
2,"This hotel is good for a single night but I wouldn't stay for longer than that.  First off, they checked us in to an already occupied room.  After that got worked out, we were in a beautiful room.  However, when traveling to that room, we ran into other guests that had incorrect booking and cleanliness issues with their rooms. The other drawback was the hotel bar.  They said they were open till 1 am and closed at 12.  To top that off, the bartender was not the most polite person in the world about it."
3,"Disappointed that the lardo pizza did not exist this night at the LV outpost of Otto. However, the butternut squash pizza was a pretty darn good.\nSat at the bar and could not take my eyes of this dude make love to this block of parmesean.... just to sprinkle some on a salad. \nAs mentioned in other reviews, this place is really loud but I was fine with it.  Other posts mentioned small portions but my pizza was easily for 2. It seemed like the salads,  charcuterie, and cheese plates could easily be shared. Admittedly, the pasta portions were not rivaling those from Maggiano's or Bucca, but they looked sufficient. \nFour stars due to the lack of lardo and for a Batali pizza, I still prefer the Mozza in LA."
4,"In a word, Rocco's is excellent. Great pizza, friendly and efficient employees, clean store, and fast. Dominoes, Papa John's, and Pizza Hut are to pizza what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Why does garbage like that sell so well when REAL pizza is close by for the same price? Actually, that other crap is the garbage that garbage scrapes off the bottom of it's shoes, but too many people are way too lazy to do anything but pick up the phone. Kudos to Rocco's, and here's a real novelty considering how the garbage places cook their's - Rocco's uses actual ovens, while the garbage uses those blast furnace conveyor belt \""things.\"" Pizza crust is SUPPOSED TO BE somewhat crispy and the only way to get that is with a real oven, but that other trash is like Silly Putty. \n\nRock on, Rocco's!"
3,"good location near Red Rock if you need a snack after/before a show.\n\nclean store.\n\nquick friendly service. \n\nWhen I mentioned that it was very cold in the store (the thermostat was set at 65'), the cashier asked another employee to turn up the heat a bit which I was so grateful for.\n\nFood was cooked to order."
2,This place is pretty good! I come here for the great drinks and amazing dessert. I don't come as often as I would like because it can be pretty pricey but it's worth it when I want to indulge. :)
2,"My very first experience at one of Emeril's restaurants, and it was a decent one. Since my sis liked it the last time she visited, she decided it was worth another try. \n\nI have mixed feelings about this place\n\nThis restaurant had spectacular service, i have to admit. For our party of 6, felt like there was an army of servers, ready and awaiting our every need.  They were constantly refilling drinks and water and made sure we always had bread on our plate.  My napkin was folded when i came back from the restroom, which i always seem to use as a good measure of service. \n\nMy favs were the country gumbo with steamed rice and the prime pork tenderloin.\n\nAs for the prime certified ribeye, I've definitely have had better.  \n\nMaybe worth another try? we'll see..."
1,"I have been to the other locations before though it's been awhile (Green Valley Ranch and the Charleston and Decatur locations). Both of those locations have since closed. I was really hoping they would rebuild the one that burnt down on Charleston but last time I drove by another restaurant was being built. Don't know why they still have the address listed on their website if they are not rebuilding. Anyways, I absolutely loved going to OPH. This was the first time I had been to this location. You would think since they only have one location open in the area (Primm doesn't count) they would focus all their attention on it. We arrived and there was a 35 minute wait. Since it was 11am on a Saturday we expected a wait. We finally sat down and our waiter came to take our order. He came back with our drinks and we ordered our food. My son also asked for a glass of water. The place was packed so our waiter was extremely busy. He never brought my son's water and we couldn't seem to catch his attention. Finally when he brought our food we asked again for the water. The food was not cooked how we ordered it so that was disappointing. The waiter was bringing beverages to a table behind us so we managed to get his attention. We asked a 3rd time for my son's water and then asked for refills on our drinks. Finally he brought it out. We saw the manager but unlike other restaurants he never walked around to see how everyone was doing. He just walked between the kitchen and the register several times. Needless to say I don't think I will be coming back especially since it's not near where we live. Would much rather prefer to go to BabyStacks."
1,"This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find."
3,This really is a dive but the food was great. We ended up here because another place we planned to go to was closed. I had the chicken gordita. Totally authentic and delish. They have a wall of different pastries and a salsa bar with fresh salsas.
4,This is where all is going well. \nThe price are excellent the food tremendous.  the staff is nice and it is one of the rare place you can be served in french.  The chicken and seafood hotpot is a must.  The variety of plates is endless
4,Best sushi value in town- Great food- Amazing all you can eat prices.
4,"Agh! I did not have the best seats for this show. I was behind a pillar and learned the hard way that \""obstructed view\"" REALLY means obstructed. I suggest you do it right and plan early so you can catch more than glimpses of this fun show.\nI hope you like the Beatles, because this show is all Beatles, all the time and I LOVED IT! The soundtrack is amazing and the performers and props were beautiful and just perfect. More than once did the show have that \""Ahhhhh!\"" factor. I can't wait to return and see this show the proper way (without Pillars). It's definitely worth the money and your precious Vegas time. It will make your trip for sure!"
4,"What a fun place!  The staff is absolutely incredible and anticipated my every need before I even knew I had it!  Wonderfully accommodating, fun, funky and kitschy - I just loved all of the attention to detail!\n\nI stayed in the Chaparral Gardenview Patio Suite, which has a huge furnished patio with loungers and a walkway to the pool area!  Lots of space in the room and even a separate living room area for entertaining friends.  \n\nDistrito - Great food! (Try the Queso Fundido with duck barbacoa!)\nOld Town Whiskey - Great selection! (Try the Commodore!)\nPool - Great DJ's and vibe on weekends! (Get a cabana!)"
2,"When Mar Y Tierra closed, a small piece of my heart broke.  Lucky for me, Mar Y Tierra has been reincarnated in Anita's Mexican Grill.  \n\nAnita's serves almost the same food that Mar Y Tierra had - but adds some chicken and burgers as well - covering the grill part.\n\nThis is mainly a takeout place, with only a few tables inside.  To order, you walk up to the counter and they'll call out your name or bring out your order when its done."
4,"Fun atmosphere, great tasting small plates, nice selection of wine, friendly staff. The food is beautiful and delicious. We shared about 7 dishes between the three of us and were able to try a lot of yummy things plus have room for dessert."
1,"I think it's time for a reality check here: the Palms sucks, and the Real World season everyone references when they're talking about the hotel aired about 5 years ago.\n\nWhy should you avoid the Palms?  Here are some reasons:\n\n1.) The crowd - Um, it's not where \""beautiful people\"" congregate in Las Vegas.  That distinction goes either to the Hard Rock or the Bellagio.  In fact, the majority of the gambling dollars at the Palms come from Las Vegas locals, and I don't mean the kind of LV locals who dance at Spearmint Rhino.  No, I'm talking about 70 year old retirees who have taken up second careers as slot jockeys.  At any given point before midnight, half the people in the Palms have grandchildren.  And the other half of the people aren't that great.\n\n2.) The food - I've seen some other people here point to the fact that the Palms has a food court as evidence of it's culinary accomplishments.  Um, it's freakin' Las Vegas.  You can do slightly better for a meal than McDonalds.  All the high end restaurants in the Palms are overpriced and overhyped.  N9ne?  Yeah, it's okay, but Fix in the Bellagio has better food and better looking people.  Guaradino's is a poor man's version (in food quality, not prices) of Diego in MGM Grand.  And Nove?  If you really want Italian, try Wynn - they have some much better places there.\n\n3.) The nightlife - I'm sure Rain and Ghostbar were great when Trishelle and the rest of the Real World crew hung out there.  Unfortunately, time rarely stands still, which goes double in clubland and triple in Vegas.  In past five or so years, places like Tao, Pure and Jet have opened.  So who goes to Rain and Ghostbar today?  21 year old guys who wear sleeveless t-shirts.  And lots of them.  I know this because I once had a job reviewing nightclubs in Las Vegas, and I remember walking into Rain and thinking I'd accidentally ended up on the Jersey Shore.  Um, not that there's anything wrong with that.  Sadly, the new places in tower 2 (Moon, The Playboy Club) aren't special.\n\n4.) The hotel - Not to sound like a design snob, but the Palms just feels cheap compared to all the Strip places.  The wooden flooring was an idea that seemed great on a designer's computer, but in real life just gets destroyed from all the foot traffic.  The casino chips feel cheap compared to what's used elsewhere in the city.  And the music is much better at the Hard Rock.\n\nIn short, skip the Palms and head for the Hard Rock or the Bellagio."
4,"We just visited yesterday the 21st. \n\nThis was by far one of my favorite stops from our weekend trip to Vegas. \n\nI purchased a Groupon for $38 for 2 people online. It came with 2 free drinks but I sadly just realized we never got our free drinks. \n\nI had so much fun seeing all the different celebrities and getting our pictures with them. Making funny faces and using all kinds of different props was beyond cool. \n\nWhat also helped is how fun the people around you are too. We really had a good group of people and seeing them and ourselves doing silly, funny and perverted things was just absolutely hilarious!\n\nGet your pictures done in the beginning! We had a funny prop and took 3 really great pictures that we purchased at the end. \n\nThe 4D movie at the end was 10 minutes in length was one of the coolest things ever! Would hate to spoil it but make sure you check it out! \n\nThe gift shop at the end was really nice and not over priced in my book.\n\nThis is for sure one stop you have to make while in Vegas!\n\nFYI: Getting there is confusing..... hint: Park in the Venetian hotel's self parking and walk to the front of the building. You will see what looks like a clock tower. Its over there and you take an escalator to the front of the business."
4,"An amazing meal! My husband and I decided on Scarpetta for dinner pretty much at the last minute. We were able to make a reservation on-line two hours prior to the reservation. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat right away. We were given a table by the window which allowed us to enjoy the Bellagio fountain show (about three times during our meal!). The wait staff was attentive and very nice. They offered advice about portion size and house favorites. Bread is served as you are seated, and it was delicious and fresh. The bread basket even includes Stromboli! Yum! We ordered a bottle of wine - a very good selection to chose from. My husband ordered the duck, and I got the short rib agnolotti with a side of broccoli rabe to share. Both meals were amazing! The atmosphere was modern yet casual. It felt sophisticated but comfortable. We will definitely be recommending to family and friends!"
0,Food was just ok. Lots of variety but Every thing very generic. Derserts very disappointing look good but all the cup cakes dry and awful! Won't be back a specially For 30$ a pop.
4,"S found this place on Yelp and suggested I try it out during my visit here in Arizona.\n\nThe Morning Glory Cafe is located at the Farm at South Mountain which has their own organic farm on premise. Their hours are limited to serving breakfast - but, oh my, do they do breakfast good!\n\nI ordered Chef Manuel's chicken enchiladas topped with two eggs over easy. I know, I know - it's a cardio slam, but it was worth every biteful! The enchiladas were filled with an herb roasted chicken breast that was savory and moist. The tomatillo sauce that topped the entire dish was one of the best I've ever had - a little bit of tang, but oh so flavorful! I sat savoring every single bite!\n\nThe beverages are self-service. The coffee, tea, orange juice and lemonade are available."
4,"Great Japanese ramen restaurant.  Came here for the \""weekly LALALA ramen pass\"".  Ordered the shiromiso tonkotsu. \n\nPro-was seated instantly for 2.  Service was speedy.  Soup was flavorful.  Got an extra helping of ramen for free (4pm-8pm special).  Every part of the ramen bowl was perfect; quality meat, great balance with the seaweed-corn-onion. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Japanese  ambience while enjoying their dinner. 5 stars.\n\nCon-none"
4,"LOVE this place. Friendly staff, great food, great ambiance."
2,"Love the concept of a drive thru salad joint. The thought and care that went into designing it was obvious. After a few trips though, I found that even after adding protein to my salads I just wasn't satisfied. The food is quality and the staff friendly and the menu is great."
0,"If I could give less than one star, I gladly would.  Any time I've had to visit this office, we've been made to wait in excess of three hours.  five seems more typical.  They could look to the DMV for a better model of efficiency.  I cannot imagine how they don't have more people staffing the windows: They're paying so many out of work people anyways, you'd think they could just hire three or four.  Since they lost the information we watched them make photocopies of, personally...  Twice...  I've had a case closed on me, and in the course of reapplying was told to come back in since I can't seem to sign up for the NEW website online.  I work nights, do I have 5 hours to spend during daytime hours sitting in a chair getting sick?  The last person I spoke to on the phone said their system had been down for five days, but half an hour earlier I was able to get the password for my new account ...  I had to call back because they didn't give me a USERNAME with it.  The lady I spoke to who was telling me that it was down then transferred me to an automated message telling me that the system was down, which then hung up on me.\nI'm a genius, and I've had over a month, maybe as much as two, invested in trying to get us insurance through the state.  I CANNOT imagine how people too stupid to qualify for jobs manage to navigate this system.  Is there a cottage industry of lawyers or squatters who sit in the office to wait in your place, professionally?  Should I call up and tell them that I like lamp, and wait for them to get me some mental retardation assistant who can walk me through this?\nJust another example of horrific government bureaucratic nightmare.  What the HELL?"
3,"This would be the grocery store if Cub foods and Copps had a baby. The produce seems excellent and overall the prices arn't too bad. Not as low as Woodmans but definitely lower then Copps.  \n\nIts the complete opposite of Woodmans whereas its clean, well lit, shelves faced, and staff seems friendly. \n\nThey have a decent deli/kitchen where you can grab something to eat and have a caribou coffee which is the first one in the Madison area that I know of.\n\nThe liquor store prices seem a little high but they have an excellent selection of...everything.\n \nOverall worth checking out....A viable option to get your weekly groceries.  And you don't have the feeling like you have to wash your hands after you get done shopping (Woodmans)."
4,"OK, this is what I love about this Paddock.  The pool staff!\n\nThe guys, for the most part, REALLY understand pool ops.  I can't say how many times I have called for advice, or stopped in with a busted piece of equipment, and not only do they troubleshoot, BUT, they will do REPAIRS FOR FREE.  Yep, that's right.  I needed a new mechanical seal for my pool motor.   Not an easy fix if you don't know what you're doing.  Bring in your motor, pay for the part, and the guys do the labor FOR FREE.  I don't know any other pool co in the valley that offers that service.  I've also brought in parts I thought were broken, and the guys will inspect it, and fix, or replace.  It's like having my own little pool guy.  Most importantly, they don't upsell you, or rip you off if you're clueless.\n\nWater testing, like everywhere, is free, but there's is electronic, so it tends to be more accurate than a guy responsible for drops to test.\n\nI seriously wish Paddock was doing better overall as a company, as they closed quite a few stores in the past few years, and seem to be getting more into patio furniture.  I'd hate to see them move so far from what they do best."
0,"Ive been to many Texas Road houses across the country but this one was very dissapointing. The food was cooked sloppily, my steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was overdone and chewy and grisly, my side of rice was overcooked and tasted like mush. The waitress forgot everything we would ask for and had to come back several times for something as simple as steak sauce. \n\nThe only redeeming factor is the bread was always delicious and amazing as usual."
3,"Stopped here to fulfill a mid-afternoon snack craving.\n\nBased on my experience at Tacos El Compita, I expected tiny lil things.  I ordered a carne asada taco and a lengua taco.  I did not realize the asada taco came with guac, so I ordered a side of guac for 75 cents.\n\nWhile waiting for the chef to cook em fresh, I grabbed salsa, limes, and some radishes and cucumbers from the salsa bar.  What I noticed is the cleanliness of this place (the dining area, the bathroom and the kitchen), and the interesting decor.  There is a green theme for sure (green painted wood, green tiled tables).\n\nThe food came out fast and the tacos were huge!  Each served on a corn tortilla that wasn't all soaking wet, and my side of guac was the same size or slightly bigger than Chipotle's and costs less!\n\nI had the asada first - it came with guac and pico, but I added a squeeze of lime and tomatillo salsa.  It was yummy.  Then, the lengua.  It came with chopped onions and cilantro.  I added the extra guac and the tomatillo and lime, then dug in.  The flavors were great, and the tongue was so good!  Such comfort food.  To be honest, I could probably have had just one taco and be full, at least for snack needs.\n\nThey have lots of specials.  This week there was a special listed for 2 tongue tacos, rice, beans and a drink for just $6.25.  If I had been in the mood for that, that is a great deal.  They also serve tortas, tostadas, menudo, and other tasty treats.  The staff is bilingual and they take cards for small amounts.  I would definitely go back and it is 24 hours!!"
1,"Now, to be clear, I have only eaten at this buffet one time and it was for lunch. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because the staff was friendly and attentive, the desserts were decent, and they had a good variety of drinks. \n\nBut the food! The food selection for lunch was sparse and what was available was not appetizing. The food seemed like it had been sitting out for a few hours at least. I'm a horrible cook, but I feel confident that I could prepare better dishes. \n\nI've been to quite a few buffets in Vegas and this is so far my least favorite."
2,"This place is very much a chain.  Corny decor, unimaginative menu, bland food, servers devoid of personality.  Still, the booths in the bar are comfy and so we had a good time dining here with friends a month or so ago and watching a playoff game.\n\nThey try very hard not to be nailed down to a particular style of barbeque.  Of course this means that they don't do anything particularly well but it also means that you could take a big group of people here from all different parts of the country and they would each be able to find something they wanted to eat on the menu (isn't that the reason for having chain restaurants in the first place?).  A lot of the dishes were served dry and then you could add your own sauce - they had 3 different bottles on the table.  And this is one of the few places we have found in Phoenix that serves Texas style beef ribs so that is a big plus.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes and the okra for appetizers.  Neither was very good (seriously, stay away from the tomatoes) but I haven't had either of them since we lived in the south so even a lousy version of the dish is better than nothing.  What was really amusing is how the server obviously had never had good BBQ in her life; you could really tell by the way she described the dishes.  Anyone who can't answer how long something was smoked and whether it was seasoned with a dry rub or a mop does not deserve to be working at a BBQ joint; even if they are only 16, that is no excuse.  Oh wait, this isn't a BBQ pit, it's a chain imitation.  Sorry, I forgot for a minute.\n\nOverall, the food and service probably should have been one or two stars if I compare it to other barbeque restaurants I have eaten at nationally but compared to what I have had in Phoenix it is a solid three, sadly.  Another thing that gave them an a-ok was the fact that they had a really good selection of beers on tap and even offered Micheladas.  I never thought that drink would go with BBQ but it was a pretty good pairing with the spicy Texas-style sauce they offered.  Too bad they couldn't even do this right; though they did have some Mexican beers on tap the ratio was off (it was like half mixer at least) and they charged $7.50 a pop for them.  I also thought it was cute how the waitress mispronounced the name of the drink and then corrected me when I pronounced it right.  Just priceless."
0,"This review is for the casino only:\n\nToo small, too noisy, too smoky, and it takes $5.00 to earn one measly point.  No newbie here, yet I managed to have the second machine I tried gobble up my newly-minted card, never to be seen again.  I'll stick with Red Rock.\n\nBUT:  I was here to see a show - Jay Bolan, acoustic guitar(s) in a solo retro 70s-80s light rock performance.  He's just begun his one-year engagement, and it was truly enjoyable.  \n\nIf I return to Four Queens, it's be strictly to see and hear Jay perform again."
3,"SBC VEGAS SERIES: 17 of many reviews\nAfter yet another long night of drinkin..\n\nYeah, we hit Palazzo, IP, Bellagio and now Hard Rock. And I do love food.. particularly good food... in this case I'll make an exception for pretty damned good food... of course it tastes better when i'm drunk... and it always tastes better when a beautiful women feeds it to you. \nOr in this case... two drunk SBC brothers...\noh well. \n\nThe girls were too busy throwing up anyhow...\n\nI just wish I knew about this damned $7.77 special and the $9.99 special.

1,"Not sure what everyone is raving about. Prices are good, but the pizza is bland. About the same crust as a NY-style pizza, but it's no where near as good as the real thing in NYC.  Tried some of their wings also.  I like that they really douse them in sauce, but they're small, tough, and fairly poor on the quality scale as far as chicken goes.  I won't be going back."
2,"This place doesn't need another chicken strip review, they are amazing and I will not knock them on that.   I would not recommend the pizza though,.  I had a coupon for a free pizza around September 2011, I was absolute shit.  It may have been due to the fact that it was free, but I would not pay a single American dollar for one in the future ever. \n\nThe actual place is pretty dive.  The bar downstairs is dark and dingy, I would not go there willingly.  Dining in is pretty meh, it's usually hot and sticky.  \n\nIf you do make your way to Geo's for the chicken strips, get them to go, you wont be disappointed."
3,"Sometimes when I'm up visiting the boy and he says \""let's just get a pizza tonight\"" I pick rocky rococo's over Ian's (which is much closer and a little cheaper for our usual order) just so that I can pop on over to Greenbush while I'm waiting for the pizza.  I have missed out on the filled ones (jelly filled is my preference) every time since my very first experience, but the chocolate covered yeast ones will do in a pinch! Verrrry tasty and for some reason they always seem fresh, even if you keep a few for the morning! The employees can be a little snarky, but who cares?"
4,"I selected Serious Fleet to perform an anticipated engine replacement as diagnosed by a certain dealership who shall remain nameless. Serious Fleet called me the next morning and informed me the engine was in tip top shape and performed a routine tune up. Their integrity and expertise saved me well over $5,000. I will use Serious Fleet going forward and would enthusiastically recommend them to anyone."
0,"#1 Cold rice.  The owner said that we received sushi rice, despite the fact that the menu said it would be fried rice.  Who wants sushi rice with chicken teriyaki?  Reluctantly they brought hot rice.\n#2 Wrong order.  We pointed to the menu and ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and vegetables.  Received no vegetables and white (cold) rice.  The owner said because we didn't sit at the teppan table we received the regular order of teriyaki chicken. Although we have purchased this in the past in the same booth.  \n#3  Chicken teriyaki was cold, and I don't mean lukewarm.\n#4  Had to wait for new orders and the birthday girl waited an additional 10 minutes for hers.\n#5  When new order arrived, it was missing the California roll (it was a Bento Box)\n#6  Charged credit card twice for the order. \n\nMaybe this was a bad day for Hon Machi, but for everything to go wrong . . . . and we didn't receive any sincere apologies or compensation for a disastrous meal."
2,"It's a beautiful place.  There are tons of hiking / biking trails, and there are a couple of roads that provide access to some fantastic views.  If you're into hiking, check this place out.  \n\nMany years ago, people with off highway vehicles could participate in off road activities here.  They no longer allow that.  I am, in general, not a fan of the city, state or federal government limiting or restricting access to responsible OHV users, so therefore I am giving this 3 stars.   I have a Jeep that I've put a lot of time and effort into making capable to handle serious off road use, and it's disappointing that I have to go an hour or more outside of the valley to do so when South Mountain is so close by.  Plus it totally makes sense that you can't drive off road here because it's a \""preserve\"", yet at some point, parts of the park will be completely destroyed when the 202 comes through (sarcasm)."
0,"I have been going to Full Circle on Dysart and McDowell for several years.  Lately they have been going downhill.  I always ignored when they never gave me the penny change from my $5.  It was no big deal, but then advertise it as $5, not $4.99.\nAnyway, The last 3 times I have been there, they have gotten very rude.  There are a lot of new people, also.  The last 3 times that I was there, employees have taken cars from the side and pulled them in front of me.  This past Tuesday was the kicker.  The employee pulled a car in front of me to block me and pulled 2 more cars in front of me.  There was not one car behind me for the rest of my visity.  \nI thnk this was my last visit there."
3,"I like that this place is close to home. From what I can tell, everything is sterilized and they have a lot of assortment of nail polish to choose from. I particularly liked this girl named Nancy. She did a really good job with my manicure and pedicure. The owner (the lady) she does a really good job on acrylics...lots of nail art too! Its about 40 bucks for a mani and pedi. I don't really like asian owned shops, but this one I will go to when I really need a mani/pedi ASAP."
3,"I really like this place. The beer was really good, food was tasty and fresh. The only negative is that they gave me grief about bringing my 4 month old, who did not make a peep, in (the server was nice, but the manager apparently had an issue with it). I could definitely understand if it were busy, but it was 7:00 p.m. on a Monday and we were basically the only people in there. That said, I thought this place was great and would definitely recommend."
2,"I stopped here in my great new wallet search.  They had one that I was tempted to buy, but this time I'm going to get it right and buy the one that fits my needs.\n\nThe store is laid out as well as department stores like this.  Aisles are wide but they make you go out of your way to get where you're going so you see more merchandise that might entice you to stop and perhaps make an impulse buy."
0,"This was one of the worst hair colorings I have EVER had, and I have had some bad ones.  To start off with I was told, the wait would be thirty minutes.  When I returned 32 minutes later, she told me she had waited for an hour and now I would have to wait an additional 20 minutes.  I left and returned 20 minutes later and sat for another 10 minutes.  My hair color was atrocious.  I looked like a scarecrow.   I had brought a picture in and thought I was clear in telling her what I wanted, but ended up with half of my dark brown bleached blond.  I seriously went straight from the salon to CVS to buy a bottle of dye to cover up the mess.  Way overpriced.  I had been to this salon prior and I paid 125 for cut color and tip.  It was 155 today and I didn't even get a cut, just a trim. Now I see she tacked an extra 30 dollars onto my card which I will have to straighten out tomorrow.  BTW, I saw Hazel.  I recommend you don't."
4,"I wish I could give them more stars. I have been visiting this bar for 3 years now and I haven't found anyplace better for free poker, UFC, and friendly service.\n\nOn a personal note, the place changed ownership in early 2011 and the previous owner had made a commitment to host a charity tournament to raise money for a friend's funeral.  Without hesitation the new owners honored the commitment and donated a substantial amount of their own money because they are just good hearted people. I had already visited the bar for 2 years at this point, but after their generosity it's my first and only choice for any sports bar activity. The owners and staff all really get to know the clientele. Most of the staff Rose, Andreah, Erika are fantastic and speedy\n\nFood - the following items are ordered often by myself or my friends \nNickelback Attack Chicken Fingers - I'm partial to the Asian BBQ sauce\nCatalina Chicken Sandwich (uses the Asian BBQ)\nBLAT Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado and Tomato\nChili MAC\nNachos - note the serving is HUGE!\nBrunch Burger\nSliders\nTacos\n\nThe drinks are reasonably priced, and especially strong when Megan's at the bar\nIf you go, ask for a Tweeter shot"
3,"I am always telling my friends at work that this place is my Disneyland. A drama teacher's best friend. Easley's is a huge 2 room store filled with props, costumes and party favors. I am there. I would move into the place if I could. lol!  I have to be very careful when I go to Easleys because I could spend my entire paycheck there.  I only give it four stars for a few negatives. ( Sadly, however these negatives still don't keep me away but are probably par for any business in this type of field) Some of their costumes, mostly the packaged ones or the ones on the rack in the rental costume room, can be made very, very cheaply, be ripped, and are ridiculously expensive for what you get. If you shop at Savers or Goodwill you can often find formal gowns that can be used as costume starters for less than 20 bucks and the you can add Easleys props, hats gloves etc. Those gown are a way better deal, last longer, and are excellent quality. For me though, and I assume true for others, the convenience of one stop shopping is is the allure. ( And please do not take that comment to mean all of their items are like that. Just be careful and double check what you buy because they have a no refund policy. I tried a dress on today that had rips all over it and one time I bought a hat that was missing a part. Just double check your stuff OK?) The other negative is that yes, they are expensive, and there hours just don't work well for me. More positives: The costumer service is great, the staff are outstanding, friendly and fun, and they rent mascot or more expensive type holiday character costumes. I also especially love the fun room. Here they have tons of wigs, accessories and cheaper types of costumes that you can put together by buying in separate pieces.  When I go To Easley's I usually spend three hours in the store browsing. I love it so much. Happy dress up folks!"
2,"This Wal-Mart is in a better/newer neighborhood. It is clean, the staff are usually helpful, if you can find them. It's not too crowded, but sometimes they don't have enough cash registers open, so lines do grow. One of their lines of clothes (NoBo) is pretty bad quality."
0,"Went to Elements for dinner with my husband and another couple who were visiting from out-of-town. When the reservation was made and again when it was confirmed, we told Donald that we needed to have a table with a peaceful almosphere and a nice view. We arrived early and were sent to the bar although the restaurant was mostly empty. \""Great\"", I thought expecting that we were indeed getting a nice table. At the time of the appointment, we were sat right next to a large round table of about nine customers, all drinking, talking and laughing loud, while the rest of the restaurant was empty!!  We requested to be moved and the waittress  did. The dinner turned out to be HORRIBLE!! Three of us ordered sea bass (approx. $45) .  The sea bass was dry and felt and tasted like straw. I did not want to disrupt the dinner again so I ate a small portion and left the rest. The waiter was mostly AwOL\n\nThis was a serious disappointment. We entertain often but wet will never return to elements nor will we recommend it.  What is going on with this restaurant? It has gone DOWNHILL! Is there a new chef, an incompetent manager? Or are they going broke? I will not be surprised if Elements closes. It used to be a fairly good restaurant. Last night it failed on all counts."
4,"YES YOU'RE SMART PHONE IS NOT BROKEN, THERE IS A SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET IN THE NORTH WEST VALLEY!!  \n\nThis Sprouts Farmers Market is fantastic and has quickly become our favorite Sprouts in the Valley.   What a great place to shop for fresh/organic foods, herbs, vitamins and produce and meats!   \n\nAlthough they are very new, they've hired a super duper team of employees that will make you think they've been open for a long time.  They have been able to maintain a high level of service and they've kept their aisles full despite the hordes of people that are shopping here :-)\n\nA few cool things you may not know about Sprouts;\n~They sell AJ'S quality food at a much cheaper price.  Especially what's in their weekly ad!  \n~They give you an incentive to bring you own bags\n~The best day to shop is on Wednesday so you can take advance to both weeks sales.   \n~Save some money and eat healthier by shopping their fresh grains from bulk.  \n~one the best gluten free shopping experience you'll have in the valley.  \n~Order lunch while you shop.  $2.99 the deli will make you a fresh deli/veggie sandwich to order.  \n\nYou're going to love shopping at this Sprouts!

0,"We came here Tuesday and wanted to watch The Amazing Spider Man. Too bad the Tuesday $5 did not apply. On top of that, I asked for two trays, filled it with popcorn and asked for a third tray to fill with my large popcorn order. The employee took half my full popcorn, filled it back up and gave me my third tray.\n\nEither we had a misunderstanding or he is delinquent. Also, there was a line for Magic Mike and Spider-Man, but the employees screwed up the lines.\n\nThe result was an angry crowd who stormed in the theatre as the manager shrugged his shoulders with a dumbfounded look.\n\nDisappointed with an unorganized theatre.\n\nThe screen is mediocre."
0,"I wish I read the Yelp reviews before this huge mistake. Like others, I decided to have lunch at Caesars buffet. The line was long and never moved. Since I hungry and didn't have all day, I decided to try the Lobster Chowder Company that I noticed during my last trip.\n\nHugely disappointing and very expensive for what you get. I went with the lobster roll with fries. I really don't like fries but they were the only edible thing in my cardboard basket.\n\nThe lobster \""salad\"" was slop. It was a huge slice of bread with a wet disgusting filling. It might have tasted like lobster but the white filling was soggy and inedible. \n\nI hightailed it back to Bellagio and treated myself to the chocolate eclair at Jean Phillipe."
2,"I can't give this place more than three stars, because it's just not my scene.  $8 cover on a Wednesday, b/c they have $0.45 drinks before 10p.  I walk in, place is packed.  Even before I walk in, i realize this place is insane, because the parking lot is packed.  Anyway.  A little bit of everything inside.  three bars and a beer tub, or was it just two bars and two beer tubs.  the alcohol was flowing, and people were dancing.  I don't dance, but I'm starting to think i should learn.  it was a little unbalanced out there.  I'm all for balance!  (not really. actually not at all)\n\nanyway, Dottsy pretty much nailed it - the mix of country and hip-hop somehow works in this place.  I told my friend that this place is quintessentially \""Phoenix,\"" on several levels.  You'll know what I mean when you get there.  The crowd on Ladies' Night is surprisingly diverse, for the suburbs.  on the other hand, I haven't been to a bar with this concentration of straight people in a long time, so your mileage may vary.  You won't feel out of place if you're not wearing a hat and/or boots, so no worries on that count, at least.  \n\nThe pours were disappointing.  the Newcastle a couple friends ordered, which I thought was a strange call, was 5.25.  Ooof.  i stuck w/ my gin and tonic for $5, which i thought was pretty decent, considering.  anyway my search for a watering hole close to home continues - the music, the crowd, and the prices kinda scare me off, although i will have to investigate how early they start charging cover.  it will be pretty cavernous when it's not crowded, but it is only 3 miles from home..."
1,"My friends and I came to visit this joint, after having tried Orient Express the week before.  We got very similar items at both locations: that is, I got a wonton noodle soup, and my friends got a pad thai and mapo-type thing with pork and rice.\n\nThe waters came out promptly, but given the emptiness of the restaurant around 9PM, it took them a good 25 minutes to come out with our food that was essentially on par, if not worse than Orient Express.  Given that our choices may not have been Lulu's forte (besides my noodles, which should have been better given their restaurant name), the ma-po dish did not resemble ma-po at all.  the sauce was light brown, and everything in there was diced, and as my friend described, despite his request to have it \""extra spicy\"", the dish did not even turn out to be any spicier than any other brown-sauced generic dishes, such as hunan chicken and szechuan chicken (i still don't know the difference between the two dishes to this day, at least by the way i've tasted it when cooked in the US).  My wontons had obviously been freezerburned, as the skin was thin, translucent, and falling apart.\n\ni will probably try this place in the future and try their other dishes.  I have heard that their smoothies are pretty awesome, so I shall try that next time. Coming soon: an update review!"
3,"Met my friend for her birthday lunch.  I arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair.  Busy as they were at the time, my request was granted quickly.  Our server seemed to have a lot on her mind.  Very serious and almost stern.  My friend ordered her favorite appetizer.  I got the salad and minestrone soup.  Both were as good as I remembered.  Our server offered Parmesan on the salad, but never offered any on the soup when it arrived.  My friend and I lingered at the table, and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break, but to stay as long as we liked.  She indicated that another server could assist us.  Nice, thoughtful touch."
4,"Gadzooks is amazing!!! Wish I didn't live in Scottsdale so I could eat this more often. Cool staff, better food. I always have to get 3 enchiladas because I can't decide on one meat. Short rib, pork, and chicken. All good. Then I can't decide on sauce so I go half red and green across all of them. Then I can't decide on cheese so I get both. It's all just SOOOO good. Everyone needs to eat here. Please open more locations!!! chipotle sucks!"
1,"Impossible to park. (Small lot and a helluva walk from non-permit streets. No meters: it's Phoenix.)\n\nDecent food and drinks.\n\nService can be OK...or towards the rude/don't care side. Depends on who is serving. A very young staff will often yield this result.\n\nToo many employees behind the main counter not doing anything. Not a manager-heavy environment.\n\nONE employee at the coffee bar making espresso-based drinks; a counter which is usually backlogged.\n\nToo much crap/displays littering the register/order area. Confusing layout, no signage and no line ropes to help form orderly queues.\n\nSeating area tables and chairs (in the big room with the grills) often not properly wiped down; crumby.\n\nAn expensive-ish modern American/gastro-pizza pub-ish menu.\n\nDessert case = a step above Fry's/store-bought.\n\nMostly a scene. Not about a quality dining experience.\n\nPeople go here mainly to say \""Let's go to LGO!\"" I'm convinced if it wasn't for the snappy acronym, business would drop 39%.\n\nSuper-fancy building exterior and interior decorating though!\n\nNo thanks."

0,"We were looking forward to trying the Farm Kitchen to enjoy local and organic ingredients. Unfortunately, we were so disappointed in the taste of our selections and pricing.\n\nWe like the concept of local, organic, outdoor dining and beautiful grounds. But, the food is the primary reason for our returning to a restaurant.\n\nMaybe our experience would have been different had we ordered something other than pulled pork sandwiches. The pork was dry and essentially flavorless. The menu indicated there was cole slaw on the sandwich; however, the menu did not indicate the slaw was not typical with cabbage and carrots. It included red and yellow peppers. I do not like any peppers in my food and would not have ordered the sandwich if the menu had accurately listed ingredients. I didn't bother to scrape it off because the pork wasn't enticing enough to eat alone. We discarded the sandwiches.\n\nPrices were very high compared to similar restaurants. Total for two sandwiches and two iced teas was $29.70. The sandwiches were $10.95 each. We are happy to pay for quality, but, I've had sandwiches with local and organic ingredients for an average of $8.95, with a side of some type. The group ordering behind us also seemed to think the sandwiches pricey when they learned the chips the cashier offered were not included. Medium sized $3 iced tea with no refills?  \n\nBased on taste and price, we will not be returning...even though the turkey sandwich sounded good based on menu description (another reviewer said the turkey was dry)."
4,"The best yoga studio ever! I have tried many others, and none come close. The studio is amazing and spa-like, the instructors are great, and there is a really decent variety of classes and times they are offered! This location has only 2 rooms but they still have a good amount of classes, although I heard from the instructors that the Summerlin location is much bigger. Can't stress how great this place is! Fallen in love with it even if their prices are a tad steep (although they run great specials once in a while). Trial and error with different (smelly, gross, and just plain bad) yoga studios has led me crawling back to this place, where I happily go and get a workout in whenever I can!"
4,"A local favorite.  Fresh baked bread hot out of the oven with a delicious garlic, balsamic vinegarette to start.  A crisp Caesar salad and the Penne e Broccoli(I like the wheat penne).  Dinner was delish . Love the service here.  It feels like home. I recommend this to anyone looking for a genuine Italian homemade dish."
0,"I have never had to write a bad review, however, this one is necessary, especially as a local business owner.  Plez read to the bottom.\nI have wanted to go to this resturaunt for a long time.  I am involved in the arts, including the downtown Mesa artwalk.  I chose to go on this past artwalk night.\nI took a friend and my two grandchildren.  Our server was friendly and informative.  Even though they did not have a kids menu, they offered a few items not on the menu.  That was nice.\nMy friend ordered a burger off the kids choice as well.  A few short minutes later, the server explained they were out of adult size burgers.  No problem.  She ordered a pasta dish off the menu and asked for the Alfredo to be placed on the side.  No problem is what the server said.\nBurgers for the kids arrived and they were huge..sort of like an adult burger.  Pasta was delivered mixed with Alfredo.  My friend explained she had requested it on the side.  The server removed the plate to fix, and he apologized.  He came back to explain that the chef was unable to put Alfredo on the side.  Really?  Omg...\nThe Ceasar salad I had was very very good...one of the best in town for sure...my appetizer was very good, but extremely small portion for the price.\nNow here comes the worst part...\nMy grandaughter went to use the restroom.  She was only in there for a minute when she came out holding her head with tears in her eyes.  She told me that the picture had fallen off the wall.  I felt her head and she had a very large bump forming already.  I went into the restroom to not only finding just any picture on the ground but a large canvas about 4' x 5' held up by a heavy wrought iron frame, hung on the wall by a single small nail.  This entire art piece was on the floor with the tiny nail left in the wall.\nI immediately told the server who said \""I'm sorry.\""  I said that I should probably talk with the manager, so he introduced me to the owner, who was rude and uncaring.  He said that he would get ice, which he did.  A 3 pound bag of ice, and sent us on our way.\nWe were so very disappointed in this entire situation.  I live downtown Mesa, so this would have been my dining and night spot..this visit, was ridiculous and I will never go back, and have and will continue to tell everyone I know of the experience.\nSorry guy, you made a few poor choices in customer service and human care.."
1,It's an airport......\n\nThe taxi guys were nice though.
1,"First entering Cesar's palace was amazing. Check In was great - Garon upgrade our room (because they didn't have any double queens - they over booked themselves) and this was the start. My roommate and I had a great time in Vegas ate at Rao's. Great Italian food, but when we got back to our room...we didn't expect what was going to happen.\n\nIt is 1:00AM in the morning. People are trying to get in our room. WHAT!!!\n\n1:15 another person knocks on our door asking if we need a bed, no covered...\n\n1:30 a family of three with security is trying to get in the room - if the deadbolt wasn't locked or we were out...what would have happened. SOOO Unsettling. \n\nWe opened the door and they were shocked to see people were in it.\n\n2:00AM Unsettling to leave we settled in for the night.\n\nNext morning - My credit card company sends me an e-mail saying my account was low...what? Cesar's put a $1318.88 hold on my account! ARE YOU KIDDING!!!! No one told us that. $1318.88!!!! Seriously. No one told us.\n\nFront desk was not helpful. I'm very disappointed. \n\nMandalay Bay - Aria - Palazzo - Bellagio - Mirage - Even Stratosphere. I would choose these places over Cesar's. I'm so disappointed, I was so excited to stay there, don't think I will do that again."
0,"Last night was the \""Field of Screams\"" event at Goodyear Ballpark. In previous years, this event has been hosted by the City Park over on LItchfield and Thomas. It should have stayed there. This was the most disappointing event I have been to in a long time. They used the strip of grass around the field to set up rides, a few booths and.....well, that's about it. \nAs far as the rides went, they had four...I think. Two were on the west side of the field and two were clear over on the east side of the field. In between were a couple booths. The ticket prices for the rides were ridiculous. You could pay ten dollars for unlimited rides...on four rides...so lame. \nThe only food vendor, other than the outrageously priced ballpark vendors, was an ice cream truck. In years prior, there were so many vendors with delicious, reasonably priced food! There were games for the kids where they gave out candy as prizes. It was a great time. At the ballpark, you could buy food from the ballpark vendors if you wanted to pay $10 for a burger or $5 for a hot dog. If I were there watching a game, I'd expect to be gouged by the food prices. But NOT when I'm there for a family event. \nAlso, in prior years, the costume contest was separated into age groups. The contest at the ballpark included everyone and only the top three got prizes. Cheap. Lame.\nLastly, can I just say that someone should have been more conscious that this was a family-type event and not let 14 year old girls in see-through tights parade around the ball park? It's a shame that some girls are allowed to dress like that and NO ONE says anything. There was a girl there last night dressed in a skirt that ended just below her waist. She was wearing see-through red tights. You could see EVERYTHING. I could not believe how inappropriate that was. It's one thing if you are an adult, going to a private party with other adults. However, when you are a teenager, going to a family friendly event, you put some damn pants on.\nShame on Goodyear. This was a poorly planned excuse to make a buck."
2,"We ate on Saturday night and paid $38/person.  We waited about 45 min in the non-VIP line. For the quality of food, I thought it was expensive.  The food was OK.  However, the dessert was very good.  \n\nOh, and while you're waiting in line, you get to numb your nostrils with smell of cigarettes.  But I suppose it's that way at all the places where you wait in line by the casinos."
4,"Where to begin where this delicious sandwich shop!!! I had thirteen guest in my party and we all enjoyed our meals very much. I ordered a medium meatball with provolone cheese and pickles...it was so tasty I bought a second one. My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak and he really enjoyed it. They also ordered the capastrami and we really enjoyed it as well...another sandwich was the turkey....least favorite.  On top of the food being delicious, the staff is amazingly friendly!\n\nThere was nothing bad to say about this place with the exception of the very limited sitting space. There are four tables with three seats each TOTAL.\n\nIF YOUR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP BY!!!!"
4,"Staff is always nice, food is prepared when you order it so its always hot and fresh. If you like Mexican food, give this place a try."
1,"This is not a strip club. It's more like a \""watch men dance in underwear club and never see anything.\""  Don't get me wrong,\nI know this club is for the ladies but when the gay friends come at least allow them some type of show."
1,"I should've listened to the other reviewers. Rude and annoyed. That describes the people working there on the particular day I was there. They seemed annoyed that people were there to order coffee!  The cashier was rude and rolled her eyes when someone said \""Oh!  Can I also get a pumpkin muffin?\""  It made me uncomfortable. I ordered a peppermint mocha and when I took a sip it was soooooo strong I felt like I did a shot of peppermint schnapps!  I went to the counter and said \""I think there's an extra shot of peppermint in here. It's really strong\"". The girl took it from me and made me another one. Never said a word. Not a sorry, not a oh no let me make you another one.....nothing. I guess I'll stick with what I know and not change up my routine."
1,"Just NOT my type of place. I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night around 8, and by 9 the place was packed.....With a very older crowd. At 38 I was probably in the bottom 10% of the age range, maybe 5%. Drinks were decent, but SUPER Expensive. Almost $15 for a martini. \nBy 10 the place was pounding pretty good, I have to say their sound/lighting system was pretty awesome. I just don't want to see women old enough to be my mom shaking their asses on the stage. If you're in the 40-60 range and looking for a solid place to party, and relive your 20s, THIS is probably your spot..... \nNot trying to be rude to the older crowd, I think its damn cool that you still know how to party....I just don't want to be there while you are! And a friendly heads up to the 21-39 crowd to avoid this place, unless you're looking for love from an older guy/girl.\nReally my 1st Club-Type(but not really a club) experience in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise that nobody was really being a drunken slob like so many club type environments in Chicagoland. I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the age group or Phoenix in general. \nEither way, not a place I'd go to again......\nTip to Management/Owner.....Having grown up in the Chicagoland Club Scene in the 90s and 00s, if you're going to have a club environment, have room for people to dance. Ditch all the tables in the 1st room in lieu of a dance floor."
2,"The hummus came with some cucumbers and a pickled vegetable. My dinner mate found it lacking in authenticity, particularly because of the chickpea chunks. Chicken shish kabob for me, Kafta for him. Everything was cooked fine, served hot, with strong flavors.\n\nI've got nothing bad to say, but there's just no \""coup de foudre\"" here."
3,"Broth was really, really good..... the veggies in my vegan pho however was obviously old which was disappointing but my friends beef pho was perfect (so she says)"
3,This place is too cute.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because as my first time there the staff was not too helpful.  The list of flavors is overwhelming.  It would be nice if they had some sno cone options that were already pre made so you don't have to decide what goes well together.  Ex.  The flavor of the day.  But the good points are.... It was the best snow cone I ever had!  The flavor never left the ice and the ice was so soft and slushy!!  I don't know what kind of machine they use to make the ice but it makes the perfect sno cone.  The decor is so cute and tropic.  And I love the little added touches like the umbrella in my drink and the color changing spoon!   Little details like that go a long way.   :-)
4,"Outstanding service, Bing was amazingly sweet and a smiley face.  Our waiter, Alfonso,  was very humble and knowledgeable with menu ask for his table a great experience, thank you"
1,I should have gotten a discount for the $3.19 for a bottle of water since I waited for the young staff of five behind the counter to stop talking smack about their so-called friends before I was acknowledged. Just passing through...
3,"Edamame beans soaked in garlic, ginger, chili!! BOMB!!"
1,"Not too impressed with the bone-in ribeye for a joint that specializes in steak. I think that the trend these days for upscale steak joints is for the restaurant staff to cut the steak for you tableside and serve the bone on seperate plate, a-la Peter Lugers.\n\nThe steak lacked flavor and could have been more tender. It seems a little ridiculous that if you would like one of their sauces it is an additional $5 on top of the $65 you pay for the a la cart steak.\n\nI did enjoy my Osso Buco with Saffron orzo which was a reasonable $35 I believe. My group also shared a steamed lobster appetizer that was accompanied by some fried stuffed squash blossoms that was pretty yummy, albeit for the price of $60.\n\nI didn't care for the bread with the lardo, I preferred the butter. The little complimentary fried cheese bread balls tasted like extremely salty cheez-its.\n\nThe side spinach was boring and overpriced at $9 and the waiter recommended eggy mashy potato thing was not memorable, literally. I don't even remember what it taste like or looked like.\n\nWe ordered 2 bottles of Joe Bastianich vino at $80/bottle. I have to say they were very good. Probably marked up 400%\n\nI'm glad I tried this spot because I'm a huge fan of Mario and Joe's mother Lidia but I won't be coming back here anytime soon."
3,"A great place to get an $8 1/3 pound burger and fries.  This is a fast food burger place for people that a willing to pay a little more for quality.\n\nI got the BBQ, Bacon, Onion String, & Cheddar Burger with SmashFries.  The egg bun (that's the only kind I buy for home) is grilled and quite tasty.  Burger was delicious, though the bacon wasn't quite cooked enough and was difficult to gnaw through.  The fries were quite good, but left me wanting some sort of aioli to dip them in.\n\nProperly cooked bacon & a custom fry sauce would merit 5 stars but I will definitely be back."
3,"We came to Houston's to have their secret chicken tender appetizer, and it did not disappoint. Another excellent, melt in your mouth white breast meat tender coated in tempura batter, with the same awesome horseradish infused honey mustard sauce and bbq sauce, with shoestring fries included. And the wait staff were all very attractive. Wow!"
4,"Just happen to be in the area so decided since I have been to the one in Chandler it should be good. I was very surprised. First the place looked so much cleaner and more professional. The cooks were dressed all in uniforms. The amount of sushi rotating were all my favorite. I ended up eating way more then I usually can. Exceptionally clean place and well organized team. Was seated quickly and water, wasabi was given to me right away."
2,"This review is for the buffet. Typical buffet food. I had saag, bombay potatoes, tandoori chicken, curry chicken and pakoras. I think they must leave out the spices for the buffet in case first timers come in. The saag was good, but it wasn't anything special. Bombay potatoes were just meh, This was however, the first Indian buffet I have been to where the tandoori chicken was not dry as a bone. It was actually juicy. Props for keeping the bones in the curry chicken, although there seemed to be more bone than meat. And the pakoras, bleh. \n\nI ordered a roti and a parantha. It was the weirdest roti I had ever seen. I am going to agree with Dean-Ryan S and say it looked like a mix of roti and naan. It wasn't horrible though. The parantha on the other hand was dry and almost burned. \n\nI was there by myself and the young guy and older woman were both very friendly. At first the guy was making conversation with me keeping me entertained but then he went in the back. \n\nI'd return perhaps for dinner. But since I don't live here I doubt that will happen."
1,"This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should. \n\nHow this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?\n\nThis place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.\n\nTime for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.\n\nI will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.\n\nLastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.\n\nNote: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix."
2,"I was really amped up to give this place a try being that it is owned by Emeril and I was a huge fan of his show! The restaurant is located in the MGM hotel and is beautifully decorated! My party arrived an hour early so we waited around to be seated. After a brief wait,  we were immediately seated and was offered a beverage while we browsed the menu. I ordered a shrimp and grits dish as well as sausage and shrimp jambalaya. The shrimps and grits were very tasteful and perfectly seasoned! The jambalaya was just ok! They initially brought out a basket full of bread and the bread was just ok. All in all they deserve 3 stars from me because wait time for my entree to actually make it the table but the awesomeness of the shrimps and grits compensated for the wait."
4,"The pizza is mouth watering and  refreshing.  The service is 5 star and if it isn't right, they make it right and you are very pleased with your experience when you walk out the door."
0,"I chose to get my car detailed at this Danny's today around 1pm.  I went to pick my car up at 4pm (when they told me it would be ready) and not only was it not ready, they obviously did not even start to work on it.  My car wasn't ready until 4:45 (making me late for work) and whoever worked on my car did a half-a**ed job.  I asked for a refund, which was refused, and was given 2 free detailing coupons (which I will use at DIFFERENT locations).  Extremely disappointed."
2,"Labor Day Weekend 14' \n\nMarquee Nightclub: (2 stars) \n\nMusic: Armin was the DJ of the night and since I am a huge fan of Armin there are no complaints on this aspect!\n\nAttendees:  In the words of Magic, Why do you gotta be so RUDE?!!!!\nThe nightclub was full of rude & inconsiderate people on Sunday night!  I was literally stuck in the front of the stage for more than 2 hours because no one would let me get out. I am not one to resort to violence but seriously people need to just calm down and move aside for people! I had a friend that went on Saturday for Kaskade and she said that it was just as bad if not worse! People need to remember that we are all there for the same reasons and that is to have fun and enjoy the music, so I hope people can learn to be more courteous!\n\nSecurity: Thank you for pulling me out of the crowd when no one would let me through & thanks for saving me from the creep that was harassing me !\n\n\nMarquee Dayclub: ( 5 stars)\n\nMusic: I really like Tritional's singles, but this was my first time ever seeing Tritional live and I thought they were really good. Although they are not as big as Kaskade and Armin they still managed to put on a good show!\n\nDrinks: It was open bar for ladies so I took full advantage of it! Although all drinks were free from 1-2pm on Labor Day, remember to be courteous and tip the bartenders it just feels like the right thing to do. \n\nSecurity: Clumsy me managed to lose my wallet, but the head of security conducted everything in a professional manner and  eventually everything worked out because a kind soul turned in my wallet ! \n\nAttendees: Everyone seemed to be really chill and much more enjoyable to be around in comparison to those from the night before. \n\n\nFinal Verdict: I don't know if I would come back for nightclub ever again but dayclub is a automatic YES !"
0,"Dear Burger King Manager at 2318 W Northern Ave: My fianc\u00e9 is too kind to write this, but I am not. Yesterday (October 9th, 2013) a few Special Needs Adults came into your Fine Dining Establishment, supervised by my fianc\u00e9 and his coworker. While it's true, one of these Special Needs Adults does have an issue with body odor, I expect he isn't the first to enter your Fine Dining Establishment with such a problem. They do landscaping work during the day in Phoenix, and don't have time to run home for a shower before sitting down for a burger and fries at your Fine Dining Establishment. I am curious to know if you also ask fully functioning construction workers, surveyors, ranch workers, etc. to leave when faced with the same issue, or if it was simply because these were adults with disabilities? Or perhaps it was because the gentleman in question was African American? I'd like to think you're just an ignorant fuck, but maybe you are a racist ignorant fuck too.  - Liz Petty"
2,"In the middle of ghost town with no where else to go (and the closest McDonalds 30 mins away) this place hit the spot. It's a basic Mexican restaurant with an awesome happy hour and good food. I've experienced the bar and wait staff, and both are helpful and quick in providing service. No complaints here."
4,I loved the fajitas. Not only was the presentation great the steak and shrimp were very juicy with lots of flavor. Server Jose was very nice and attentive. The manager stopped by and ask how things were and overall it was a place I'd go again.
3,my iPhones were broken and the 2 phones were fixed in about 1 1/2 hours. great service and very pleased with the ease and speed. definitely recommend it!!
2,"Hillside, you urban hipster you, what are you doing in all-white- tookee with its' 5 series BMWs and Eddie Bauer car seats..you my friend are raking in the in crowd. \n\nI hit up Hillside on a Sunday and had a brunch lunch moment. I had the croque monsieur and it was meh. The sauce had very little taste and was indistiguishable from the cheese. My husband had an outstanding Reuben, the pastrami was delish and the bread for both of us was great. We had iced tea - standard..\n\nThe wait staff was rather unremarkable. The open kitchen is relatively interesting..nothing too complicated happens so its' a little like watching Subway but hey its' urban hipsters making your sandwich."
4,"Total Wine and More is like a big grocery store for wine and beer. They have a great variety of wine and also craft beer.  You can find almost anything in here.  If you're a beer snob, check inside the beer fridge for beer from local breweries that bottle and can their beer. You can also get kegs of local beer or mass produced cheap beer.  They also fill growlers for reasonable prices.  They even have some food offerings, including Boar's Head cheeses (would like to see more cheese to go with the wines). The staff is very knowledgeable."
2,Standard cafe with more food offerings than most on willy but cash only and limited places to pop a squat. Aaand by limited I mean unless you're solo or dos options are slight.
0,"In Las Vegas, Rick Moonen's Seafood at the Mandalay Bay is suppose to be pretty good.  There are 2 restaurants of his here: 1 is the fixed course meal higher end restaurant and the other (this one) is just a middle tier restaurant.  The menu is a little strange as they have your typical American no frills seafood AND sushi.  My buddy ordered the sushi portions and he was quite unimpressed.  Then again, I would never order sushi from a restaurant like this.  We shared the oyster sampler.  Honestly, the oyster sampler is rather bland.  The oysters don't have much flavor or taste to them.  Maybe it's these particular ones they chucked, but overall we were rather disappointed.\n\nMy main entree was the seafood cioppino.  The pasta was cooked well like I wanted (al dente).  However the seafood they gave me tasted rather frozen/stale.  The clams were very small in their shells.  The shrimp was overcooked like crazy.  The calamari was chewy like it was frozen.  The only saving grace was the fish they used which tasted the most fresh in this bowl.  The sauce was a little spicy with an Italian kick to it."
0,"I just leased my 4th car from this location. My first three experiences here have been great. The service guys are very good as well. But this time there were so many mishaps it was ridiculous and they have done nothing for service recovery except tell me they fired someone. That does NOT make up the the way they misrepresented Findlay Lincoln and the bill of goods I was told lied to about. Very, very disappointing. I have called and left two messages for Nathan. He lives by my friend and has always said to call him if I needed anything. No returned call. The 3rd time I called I had one of his grunts get the phone and told me he was the one I should speak to. I told him all that happened and he was going to get back to me but that was over three weeks ago. I didn't catch his name but he was not very well versed. All he kept telling me was that the person was fired. That does not take care of the issues at hand. \n\nThat's my Findlay review. It is too bad since all of my experiences there prior were great."
1,"I know our postal person is based out of here and it seems like it's always someone different. They put mail in the wrong mail boxes all the time. Claim they attempted to deliver something to the house, even though we know we were home at that time. There was no notice left at the door or in our mailbox. \nWhen I complained to the man at the post office, all he said was maybe your notice blew away. Well maybe you should use some other kind of notice that you can attach to the door knob like other delivery companies do.\nThe lines here are often very long, it's not often I have to actually use their services, thank goodness."
4,My husband and I  love Zipps.  we go once a eeek for a beer and a salad or slice of pizza.  we slso love their nachos and salsa.  Service is always Great.\nNever disappointed
3,"I was at the Mint's Grand Opening, to see Tommy Georges open his new spot. As a friend and former coworker of Tommy, I was proud he landed this new spot, and was excited that Valley Fave, Johnny Chu was named the chef featuring his brand of Pan Asian cuisine. The Grand Opening was an insane affair, so I just went back after the fire died down to finally try the Pan-Asian inspired menu. When I walked in the bright spot was full of members of the EO Forum members, which included some of the best entrepreneurs in the Valley. I saw lots of old friends and chatted up several people at the bar. I love a great long bar with lots of people and find it stimulating to spark up conversations over relaxing libations. \n\nI enjoyed my menu selections, and love savory Asian cuisine. I tried the Sizzling Shrimp and rice. The plump shrimp were drizzled in a piquant glaze that had sweet and sour notes. I also tried a dish of delicious sugarcane pork skewered on ginger sticks. I love that dish! I have to get Johnny to show me how to make that dish and I cannot wait to go back and try it again. To accompany my tapas dishes I had a fantastic cocktail called the Jefferson, which featured Effen Cucumber vodka. I drank 2 of those summer-appropriate refreshing drinks. The highlight of my night was my pixie bartender, Kaitlyn Rieker. She was fantastic, and kept up the witty banter with a bar full of thirsty and demanding men. I met a fantastic character straight out of Central Casting named Arty. This gentleman was of the old school and he is a casino host currently working in Reno. He regaled me with stories of his time in Hollywood at Columbia Pictures, Charles Bronson, old-time Mobsters, Boxers and the tell habits of Asian Gamblers. \n\nWe were joined in the revelry at the bar by a giant of a man named David Richardson, an associate of Arty's, and my friend, Brian Boubek, from CEA Global Education drank a couple of bottles and wine and had a great time. We had good service from the cute and energetic Kaitlyn and her bar manger, Dolh Chompupong. I cannot wait to hang out here again!"
1,"I really hate giving honest reviews on new mom and pop type places but, at the same time it is important to pass along the message the way you feel it does not mess with the integrity of Yelp. Hopefuly maybe will cause the business to improve the food. \nWith that said I have know about this place for about a month now since I get flyers on my apartment door and mailers. I also drive by it all the the time where it is located next to a Quizno's that has opened and closed twice. So, not a good sign on proper location. So I looked at the menu and it is a fusion restaurant of Italian and Chinese?? Kinda reminds of the joke restaurant of Mexican/Irish in the movie \""Best Friends Girl\"" mmm not a great idea.. But, I wanted to try because the price were extremely cheap!\n\nSo I came in to the restaurant and it was empty and I was not even sure if it was open until I looked in the window and saw people cooking. \nEverything on the menu is really cheap and nothing more than $6. The counter people were nice but, obviously still figuring out their job.\nSo here is what I ordered\n1.Szechuan Angel ($5) Angel hair pasta with peanut sauce and chicken. That came with Pesto bread and Salad. Oh man.....I should have known better angel hair with peanut sauce not a good idea and it lacked a lot of flavor some weird textures with the chicken. I did not touch the salad cause I got so much food. The bread was burnt and super cold I took a couple bites and passed. The whole pasta meal was thrown away within 5 bites. \n2. General Tsao Chicken wings ($3) you get 6 of them. Well these were a little better but not much. I ate 3 of the 6 , the sauce was bit different than I have had before and it had strange flavor that I think came from the actual chicken wing that I think might be from the oil that had a gasoline type flavor.It is was very small but not good.\n\n3. Pepperoni Sausage egg roll ($1) This was something that was a lot better except it was super cold and I had to warm up at home. ( I dont think think this place has anyway of keeping things warm when they makes things one at time)  But, anything in a egg roll wrap would be good but this was pretty decent and a good price.\n\n4. Firecracker Egg roll ($1) Probably my favorite item here and the funny thing I think this is more Mexi/ Chinese fusion than anything. It is an egg roll with Grilled chicken, Jalapenos and Cheese. This is very good and I should of got $12 of these and the price is very good\n\n5. The last thing I ordered was the Egg roll Canoli ($1) This was also very good. Just a basic canoli cream with chocolate chips piped into a formed egg roll shell. I really liked this and also a great price.\n\nOverall I paid $12.97 with tax so pretty cheap for that much food except I threw away more than half.  I would come back for the Egg rolls and deserts and I think they are on the money with those. They just might need to get a heat lamp.\nThe fusion pasta needs to go and maybe they should focus on Chinese and have proper noodles to match the dishes. Obviously Vegas is flooded with chinese restaurants but this part of town is not. I will probably try them again just cause the prices are so good and the fried stuff is strong. But, I will stay away from the pasta dishes for sure."

1,"Update:  Just as I thought, this place went out of business EXACTLY WITHIN A YEAR as I predicted.  They were just too expensive.  I am actually saddened because I hate seeing this across town with businesses closing.  I was actually rooting for them, even though I thought they were over priced.  I don't ever want anyone to close their doors -- but the truth, ANYONE could have seen this coming (outside of the owners, of course.)  Good luck to them in the future -- but next time, make it more affordable.  They could have achieved this by slimming down their menu and offering fewer choices for salads -- a menu rather than \""create your own.\""  Any restaurant that provides a \""create your own\"" menu just starting out can expect hard times in a poor economy.  Food costs will go up very fast.  Oh well, sorry Salad Creations....  sad to see you go.  :-("
4,"amazing service, clean rooms and overall a amazing value for the price. I will be back."
0,I so want to like this place. I love their pizza that is naturally thin crust. We used to order it in north Phoenix and decided to do so a couple times since moving. I have noticed that there seems to be 2 franchises and you will only find half of the locations on one site and the other half  on a similar site.  For the myrosatis.com I have yet to have a great experience. We received the wrong order this time and I took us 2 hours to get what we ordered. My fianc\u00e9 keeps telling me to give up on this place. Let's just say we ate in silence tonight. Just noticed that the other rosatis of almost equal distance and different website has much better reviews. If my fianc\u00e9 ever let's us get pizza again from here we will be going to the other one. I still love the pizza and garlic bread. When it is hot.
0,"Worst service I've had in a long time. The waitress was snotty and literally couldn't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill (gave her a $20 bill and she sat there like 'um, 20 minus 12.44 is....uh....uh....'). Pho broth was overly salty. It took more than ten minutes to get my bill and I had to go up and ask for it. I will never, ever, go back."
4,"I recently completed a cross-country move, from Phoenix, AZ  to New Mexico. I have always been wary of long distance moving companies, and have heard some horror stories about things not being delivered on time, or being lost or damaged. I found Trico Long Distance Movers online They had excellent reviews, so I hired them to move my household to our new home. The price was very good. There were no hidden fees, and everything arrived on time and in perfect condition. Usually in any move something gets broken, but there were no damages! I was very satisfied, and will use Trico Long Distance Movers again."
0,"House takes tips from waiters then charges you again. Be sure to check your receipts. When we arrived we had  a menu with prices on our table. One of the managers promptly took that menu off the table and gave us a new menu with the same items at twice the price. \nWe had attended a time share meeting at Diamond Resorts and they had given us a 100.00 gift certificate for attending. They said they would make the reservations for us which they did. \nThis is why the Chart House switched menus as they  figured we had an extra 100.00 to spend.\nWe will never go back to this place.\nThe waiter was great but very embarrassed for the menu switch. \nHe didn't want to get into trouble about this issue so we paid cash, shorted the restaurant and gave the waiter a cash tip in his pocket.\nI wonder how many people attend those time share meetings and never know the prices have been jacked up."
4,"I would like to thank my addiction to comic books for another addiction.. Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.. but as the ad states clearly, they're not really Gourmet sandwiches, they're damn tasty sandwiches.. and let's leave it at that. \n\nI needed my comic book fix on a Wednesday afternoon and well, I found a shop about two stores down from this location. After getting my weekly issues, I was allured by the sign saying that the smells were free and sure enough, those smells were something i would pay for if I had to. \n\nThe sandwich prices were really cheap. Who needs some silly Subway when you have a place like this? Workers were pretty helpful and I'm glad I didn't have to deal with a Sandwich artist, as true art is very subjective on being enjoyed by all. \n\nMy first sandwich here was a Turkey Tom. Maybe I was just trying to cleanse my system from all the drinking with some healthy protein, but this sucker was delicious. While some may not like sprouts, I think they're the forgotten green. Be them a micro one.  \n\nTheir Vito was also really good. Them Italian subs, now that there is a spicy genoa salami sandwich with capicola and provolone and hot peppers! \n\nTheir house brand chips were also pretty damn tasty considering I'm not much of a chipper lover. I think I'm hooked after this first taste to sandwiches here. A shame since I'm a state away."
2,"We stopped in here yesterday for some bagel action. \n\nThe guy taking our orders should not have been taking orders. not only did the hubs and I both have to repeat our very simple orders several times, he then told us we couldn't order drinks with him but at the register, which we always place our drink orders with the order taker... He seemed very overwhlemed.\n\nOur drinks took forever. They were busy but the cashier is the drink maker as well apparently. We had to wait for a good 10 minutes for her to make our drinks. Meanwhile we see a manager just walking around, jump on drinks dude! \n\nWhen we got home we found our order messed up and none of the bagels were toasted like we had asked :( wah wah. Total bum out."
1,"I woke up with a mean hang over on Saturday in dire need of some greasy diner breakfast. My roommate told me this place was close, and that she had heard it was decent. Sweet! a breakfast close to the new pad! \n\nNope\n\nWalked in to a podium type stand with a hostess behind it. She had her head down. She didn't look at me, and didn't greet me either. She grabbed 2 menus and started walking over to a booth. Half way there, she looked back at me because she probably sensed that I wasn't tailing her. \""Oh!\"" I said.. \""You are seating us\"". I sat down and brushed her shitty service off.\n\nWe sat at that booth for about 8 thirsty minutes before my breakfast partner grabbed the next waitress walking by to ask for water. That waitress was very nice. She took our orders, apologized for the wait. She said our real waitress would be over to help us with anything else needed.\n\nOur real waitress:\n\nLooked like she hadn't slept in 2 weeks, and had about 3 or 4 hickeys on her neck. Show some class girl!\n\nI had a veggie skillet with 2 eggs over medium, instead of scrambled. The eggs were under cooked for over medium. Everything was bland. My roomie just got scrambled eggs and bacon, which she said were fine.. but how do you fuck that up? Maybe I am a snob. Even though the food was crap.. A smile and greet upon entering, and speedy service would have been worth another star to me. Fuck this place."

2,"I came to Vegas to escape Hipsters. \n\nNot to punish this place,  I give 3 stars for me being delusional about ever escaping hipsters and not actually going inside. (long line of hipsters outside, looked crowded, multi-police presence during a hipster squabble in said long line)\n\nBut as far as bars in Vegas are concerned, this seems way more tolerable that ANYTHING you would find on the strip, and clssier that anything else you would find off the strip."
4,"Solid stop for video games. Store's pretty big, and I've always had friendly service no matter who's running the store. It's pretty well organized for midnight releases as well. Excellent service and big location, can't ask for much more in a Gamestop."
3,"I treated my sister Vi for her birthday. The atmosphere was very lively, what you'd expect for a popular pub. I did appreciate that they did not have music blaring loud, so you could actually hear yourself speaking. Our waitress was friendly and attentive; she refilled our drinks without us having to ask her. We shared fried zucchini as an appetizer. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. We ended up taking half of it home. I got the 4 onion soup and it was very good, but I wish they would have included melted cheese over the top the way you get french onion soup. I had a chicken salad, it was good and the chicken was very well seasoned and succulent. The chicken was the star of the salad for sure. For entrees Vi had the corned beef and cabbage, which she really enjoyed, and I had the Shepherd's pie. The portion size of the Shepherd's pie was massive! Instead of using mashed potatoes they had potatoes broken up into pieces. Also included were carrots and mushrooms along with plenty of delicious, moist morsels of beef. I was so stuffed I could only eat about one fourth of my Shepherd's pie, so I took the rest of it home. The food is high quality and you really get an impressive value for your money. I definitely plan on returning!"
0,"This location is actually closed now. \n\nWhen I went, I brought in 2 huge bags of clothes which included New French connection heels, some vintage Ben Sherman, etc. Everything I brought is was in good condition. After looking through everything for 15 minutes, they told me they had no use for any of these things. Really? Ben Sherman? Their loss, so I sold them on eBay and made some good money. No point of returning. Selection in this store looked like a goodwill on a bad day for triple their price."
3,"Positives: GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!! I dont think I've ever had a bad dish from this place but if I had to call one out, it may have to be their desserts...not always the greatest options there.\n\nNegetives: They open at 11:30...not sure if that's the magic moment, but it seams a bit later than what everyone else does. This place also seams to be newer, so their process of bringing customers in, seating them, and serving them is still a bit rusty. However, everyone is friendly and the food is great so this sorta makes up for these minor flaws."
3,"Great brisket and Texas toast, and I'm a Texan, but the portions seemed small for a BBQ \""plate\"" that's $12.50. The turkey had great smoked flavor, but was dry. The onion rings and white slaw were good. The service was fine. We went for lunch on a Friday. They have a nice side patio. The parking is definitely limited and tricky to get to from I-77. I thought turning right at the light and going in from Tryon St would be best, but it's a one-way parking lot going the other way. It looked like they had another lot if you drive past it on West Blvd and turn in. Overall, a good experience, but I still prefer Midwood Smokehouse."
4,"Wow!  This was an unexpected surprise.  This little spot has terrible reviews, but it seems to be mainly service problems.  Please do not let that dissuade you...the food was great!!!\n\nWe asked the waitress for a suggestion and she said the burgers were great.  So we went with it.  I got the Wicked Burger, with added bacon.  This burger was great!!!  It was big, juicy, and yummy. The bread was soft and fresh. It has an egg, cheese, and Wicked sauce, which was basically Thousand Island dressing. But it also comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion, even though the menu does not say so. I got fries on the side and they were good. \n\nMy friend got a different burger and she raved about hers too. \n\nSo glad we did not listen to the reviews or let the 2.5 star rating deter us.  Oh yeah, out waitress/service was awesome too!"
2,"We had the Kobe Burger and the American Classic, with sweet potato fries, onion rings, and the Pink Monkey milkshake (strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream).\n\nThe Kobe Burger was quite tasty although pricey at $17. The American Classic was topped with a plentiful amount of bacon which made it very good. The milkshake was also very good - you can taste the real fruit ingredients they used to make it but again was pretty expensive at $8.75. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the meal it was not amazing - there are better options in Vegas for your money."
0,I should have been charged for mani/pedi gel extra & I'm over the sharing of nail polish while getting my toes done the woman doing mine was sharing the same polish while talking to the guy doing this other woman's both of us were annoyed. While they were talking Vietnamese & laughing she & I were saying we'd never come back again. I'm done! I can do it in the safety of my own home. Sally Hansen sells a great starter kit you & a friend could do just as good as a job.
2,"We ordered about $6,000 in work from them.  Our salesmen was great and so were the installers.  Two different people came to measure twice.  We had to call to check on an install day as if they may have forgot.  However when they came to install, 3 of my 4 gates were measured wrong.  The installers did everything they could to fix it in the field which eventually they fit. This doesn't  leave us any room for play if the gates settle.  The 4th gate was taken back because it was so off.  They called their field supervisor and he didn't even respond to take a look.  All he said was \""fix it\"". Well, it's hard to fix when the gaps are so big.  \n\nIt should have been a two hour job that turned into a whole day.  My installers were completely apologetic.  It has been almost a week and still a supervisor hasn't reached out to give us an update.  Bottom line, the customer service is lacking.  The gates are beautiful but not so much as they are driving away on their truck."

3,First foremost got too give props too my boy Roy E for winning the free tickets on yelp giveaway! Big Mahalo for hooking me up taking me along for the wine walk at Lake Las Vegas. I never been too Lake Las Vegas so I was  excited about not only checking out the property but also support great cause or any charity is great charity. Wine Walk its literally self explanatory waking around the shops/mall tasting different wines at twenty different stations. Some that were in stores but most part they were all set up outside. Unfortunately being my first Wine Walk learned trail by error few things that could have helped made the experience even better.\n\nI would recommend getting here ON TIME before it starts get your glass because later you come NO way that going too get all twenty stations in. They are going too run out of wine. Two stations went that were out and literally two stations got the last few drops. I understand its kind of confusing find each stations but most part just walk around most stations right next too one another. They did mention that could go on the internet shows you all the info. I know we live in the digital age but figure more clearer signs would be good idea. Make sure you eat before because unlike other win tasting events this one has no food. They do have couple restaurants options there none that had urge too check out. \n\nReally on whole Wine Walk is something that really enjoyed! I love the whole outdoor experience then say UNLVino or any other event. The weather was absolutely gorgeous! I know that hit or miss but thankfully it was out of the ballpark that night. The volunteers were all AMAZING! Everyone pouring with smiles and positive vibes all for great cause. Fellow yelpers that were holding down not just one but TWO pouring stations. GREAT JOB!! It be too long mention everyone but great talking stories with everyone! You know who you all are! Wish you all could have had one with me. Our own intern Molly. Your hard work always get noticed. But also U truly show everyone meaning of yelp lifestyle. Yelp Rocks!!!!
1,My meatball sub was kind of disappointing. I mean really all the meatball subs in CLT have beens sadly. More cheese is not the answer.
3,Fabulous mid century treasures...for all price points. They are absolutely a delight to work with and complete professionals. I am so glad they have moved into this space and are no longer just by appointment only! All of their pieces are in such great condition and they tend to have really unusual cool items. Love this place- huge fan!
0,Go to this place if...\nyou feel lucky: they will not give you what you order.\nyou feel like being abused and looked down on: they will tell you they do not see anything wrong with your order.\nyou do would like run to the cleaners: the lid was not properly placed on my coffee so it spilled.\nyou want more abuse: call corporate and complain.\n\nWhat do I know I am just a stupid customer.
2,Wonderful customer service at this store from manager Terry
2,"You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. That's how I feel about the SLS, the renovated Sahara Hotel.\n\nSure, the hotel now has fancy restaurants and a modern interior design, but the infrastructure is still old and decaying. Some elevators don't work. And my biggest complaint is that the walls are very thin. Was woken up at 2AM by a baby crying next door. Tip: Bring earplugs!\n\nMy experience wasn't as bad as other reviews have noted. No issues with the service or room size for me. However, since the SLS occupies an old building, even with the redesign, the overall look and feel didn't appear luxurious or contemporary, what I'd expect from the SBE brand."
2,"I've since been back several times, this place deserves three stars rather than my original two. I'd even give it 3.5 if that were an option. It's decent thai food. It's not the best, it's not the worst, and typically the service is friendly."
3,"Every time I go to Bar Smith it is dead, & I think this is very sad and disappointing! I've been there on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The staff, especially the bartenders are really fun and affable & the house music & djs are generally pretty darn good (depending on the night though...last Thursday I heard Jesse McCartney downstairs, I felt like I was back home in Idaho.) \n\nI love the rooftop bar and dance area (everyone go. now. the weather is perfect!) The drinks are relatively cheap, which surprised me. The lack of lighting doesn't bother me a bit, it adds to the swanky, slightly mysterious ambiance of the area, and I think (I hope!) pretty soon Bar Smith is going to start having a stronger & more consistent following and will be a snazzy place to see and be seen in downtown."
0,"Ugh.  Just no.  Why?  It takes forever to get in.  It's complete anarchy trying to get in, even when your name is ON the list.  The music is boring and repeated often.  The drinks are small and expensive.  The crowd is, um, less than savory.  The floor is wet...all the time.  And a trip to the bathrooms requires a sherpa guide.  \n\nStick to the deli outside Pure.  The drinks and service are better and you get to hear the music from the Pussycat slots nearby.\n\nMy parting memory of Pure was walking outside alongside some Guidettes who had taken off their shoes and could barely stand.  One of them started ralphing on the sidewalk outside Ceaser's while the other girl held her hair.  Classy!"
1,"Typical Wendy's fare.  However, nowhere to sit.\n\nAnd don't even think about trying to sit at the Round Table Pizza next door as the wolves will run you off.\n\nTake your Classic Single on the airplane and make your row-mates jealous.\n\nEmployees?  Meh."
0,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had.  My wife and I had my sister set up the rooms as she is a local to the vegas area.  We were assured that the rooms would be in the newly renovated portion of the hotel.  We had a group of six people, 4 of which were visiting from Brazil.  I must say that the greeters were very nice, but that's where the good experience ended.  Upon opening the elevator at our floor, we were hit with an overwhelming damp, old problems with plumbing type of smell.  The carpets, elevator, and floors were absolutely filthy.  The carpet was so old and dirty, that it was stretched and lifting off the floor.  I really hope that there wouldn't be people with mobility issues walking here as they would fall.\nOur room was very dirty.  You can tell that the cleaning staff had not been trained, or were not being supervised well.  The floor in the bathroom had hair all over, the towels were stained, and everything looked very dingy.  The bed itself seemed clean (I checked).  We sat down and got alerts for our credit cards that things were being authorized for more than what we were told at the front desk.  We went down and complained about the pricing and filth.  Turns out that things were not explained to us very well upon checking in regarding authorizations and costs.  When they heard about our rooms, they promptly switched us to another floor, all three rooms.  \nWhen we went to the new floor, the carpet was a little cleaner but not by much.  We had a cracked mirror in the bathroom, everything was still dingy, and one of our group found cockroaches in the bathroom.\nWe will absolutely never stay here again.  Especially since their advertised rates are always low, since upon check out they somehow get you for at least 50% more.\nHORRIBLE  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Don't bother spending money here."
3,"I bought a guitar online, but it needed to be set up (altered)--in particular, the action on it was too high. I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\n\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\n\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\n\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community."
1,"My mom and I eat at this location regularly...it's a good place to healthy quick meal for lunch. But today was anything but...the service was the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and ask the server to substitute the fries for the wedge salad, and some extra BBQ sauce on the side. The server said no problem. My mom ordered vegie taco and soup off the two item mid-day lunch special. It took forever for the food to come out and when it did come out, my order was wrong. My mom asks for some tobassco sauce and extra pico. The server comes back and said that the cook was fixing the order and that it would take 2 minutes...my mom asks for tobassco sauce again. So, as I'm waiting for my food, I notice that all the customers in her area don't have food on their tables and the server is no where to be found. 20 minutes later, my mom is done eating and I'm still waiting for my food. She brings out my order but this time instead of giving dressing for my wedge salad, she gives me bbq sauce.  I scarf down my food as fast as I can so I don't get back to work late from my anything but a quick lunch.  I ask for a box...time goes by...I ask another server for a box. The server then brings out the check, without asking which piece of pie I want, which she so cheerily announced was included in my meal when she took our order, and runs off...where is this girl hiding at?!? I ask to speak the manager, meanwhile my mom looks at the check and notices that it's all wrong.  The girl charged us for a three item mid-day lunch special and extra soup and instead of substituting my fries for a salad...she charges me for extra side salad. So I didn't get fries, which came with the meal, and was charged for a salad.  So when the manager, who was very curt and couldn't bother to stop a second to speak to us, comes out, she announces that she fixed the check. My mom asks her about the substitution and she said that's how they do it.  REALLY so then I'm thinking...if you're gonna charge me for the fries anyway...I want my fries! But I don't have time to argue with her and just say whatever, paid her and left without pie. Probably will not go back to this location again. I'm guessing that the server's bad customer service stems from the awful management. I see why this is the last location in town but sadly, I don't think this one's gonna last much longer either!"

0,"CVS on Russell- beware! After calling the corporate office - because I've: a)waited 10 min before being acknowledged at the counter b) been hung up on after waiting 9 minutes on hold c) been told I don't have current insurance, and then returned an hour later t only to be refunded the full price they charged me because their staff is incompetent... SO the corp office said \""this location is understaffed and running with a intern, a floater and a pharmacist on her 1st assignment. There isn't a lead, a manager or anyone who is experienced working there! Thank DOG my insurance also is taken at Walmart... Never thought I'd be happy about making a trip there ;)"
3,"This is probably one of the best Michaels in town that I enjoy going to. I've shopped at other Michaels throughout town but they don't have as much selections as this one does. Clean place and organized. Customer service can be worked on some. Never get greeted nor asked for help. When I need help, usually I would have to go search for someone."
3,"I've found that pretty much All the employees at Home Depot are pretty friendly accommodating and always asking you if you need help. I recently purchased a $200 artificial Christmas tree after watching it for weeks for upcoming sales. Of course it went on sale from 11/28-11/30 for $79. I called and asked if they would honor a price adjustment. They said no. I was even willing to take the tree down and bring into store and return then buy for sale price bc $120 is a lot of money. They also told me no. I was frustrated and ended the phone call. Not a minute later the manager called me back, knew my name and said they would honor a price adjustment. This,to me, is excellent customer service and this Home Depot had scored extra points with me. It's always worth asking and expressing your feelings, but in a polite way of course"
1,"Last minute trip to lake Las Vegas and looking for something to eat...  We were craving Italian tonight, so boyfriend and I decided on this place. \n We got seated pretty quick, and right off the bat you can see waiters running around like chickens with their heads cut off! It was pretty busy inside so maybe that's a good sign the food is great?\n As we got seated, it took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and when we did, our waiter only asked me what I wanted... My beau was not pleased but let it slide. When he came back, we wanted a beer and asked for a recommendation, and when we asked how it tasted, he said..\""it tastes like Italian beer\"". Wow, but of course!!! How stupid am I!!! So after we received our Italian beer, it took another 10 minutes to get complimentary bread... We were some what annoyed, but not too hurt since our check in included 20% off our meal!! (Thanks yelp!) so here is what we ordered:\n\n- fried gnocchi\n- lobster ravioli \n- pappardelle with shrimp and saffron sauce\n\n Fried gnocchi was not crispy as imagined, quite soggy actually, but the gnocchi itself was tasty... Or so I thought for the first 3 bites. There was a weird taste, almost like a smelly mildewy cheese taste. I thought there was cheese inside, but there wasn't... Only 4 pieces tasted like that. Grossed out!!!\n Lobster ravioli was descent, but the filling was a bit too fishy. The sauce and pasta were cooked perfectly though. \n The pappardelle pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, saffron sauce was amazing (wish there was more of it since it seemed more like a coating) and there was a good amount of shrimp, all which were a decent size and perfectly cooked.\nThe bread we received was nice and crusty, although it took about 15 minutes for the second order. \n\nIn general, this place was just ok. They have specialty pizzas so maybe they're more popular with that. The atmosphere seemed crazy rather than a romantic little restaurant in Italy. Everyone seemed rushed, no one seemed friendly, and it almost felt like if you took too long on ordering or asked for assistance, they put a curse upon you! Thank goodness for that discount, and pricing was reasonable ($65), but other than those reasons, I wouldn't return. That's too bad since my saffron pappardelle was delicious!!! Plus it's not worth the 45 minute drive. \n I hope this place realizes that there's no business if the customer doesn't feel warm and welcome. Hopefully some staff retraining will help. I hope so, because guests will flock if the food and service is top priority... Plus, they need it all the way in lake Las Vegas... Just saying!!!!!"
0,"I hate these people. (at least in the office)  They cannot find their way out of a paper bag to save their life, in the billing dept.  They can't set up autopay, (really?  In 2012?)and then they don't send out notices for the future payments.  Then, the lady told me that my credit card didn't go through so she needed a second card.  I gave it to her, and then got a phone call later that afternoon that they were refunding the first card because the payment went through on both cards.  Today I get a call that I still owe for the second and third installments.  Get a clue people"
4,"My friends and I decided to take a last minute trip to Vegas for our spring break and everywhere was either way too pricey or sold out.  My friend had booked through Las Vegas Suites for her birthday last year and I remembered how great it was.  Sure enough, we booked a suite with them and had a great time at the MGM Signature! Who could beat a low price room with a huge jacuzzi tub, king size bed, a pull out couch bed, and a great view?! Overall, great experience, definitely booking through Las Vegas Suites for my trips from now on!"
0,"This place is now called the Penthouse Club..BOO BOO!! I liked it better when it was called Sin... I came here with some friends after a wild night at Prive.. Made it rain on a bunch of strippers, drank more Whiskey, made it rain some more... I was having so much fun!! But what killed it for me was the waitress that tried to steal my friend Nick's cell phone while he was getting a lap dance... He got into a little argument with the bouncers(I thought we were gonna get our asses kicked) but after they mysteriously found his phone in the garbage... They offered us 2 free bottles on our next visit..Boo for this place!"
4,"eco-fresh is great!  highly recommended.  \n\nthey came to my house, picked up my (very) dirty, beloved 12'x8' wool rug.  i was in the middle of a move and we arranged for it to be delivered to my new address, which it was with no problems.  my rug is now soft and beautifully clean, with no chemicals!  they really did a wonderful job!  the price was just what they quoted me and totally, totally worth it."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE. \nThe people are inconsistent and extremely rude! Especially the younger blond. She asked me to move my car 30 seconds after I finished washing my car so others can use the vacuums only because they decided to take away more than half the vacuums to save money but causing customers to take more time cleaning with one vacuum. I tried to tell her I just finished and she jumped on my case saying she wasn't going to waste time arguing with me and to talk to the owner as she is the manager. \nSometimes they do clean the front of the cars, sometimes they don't, mind you I always get the second to least expensive wash. The employees their never smile either. The time before last I got a wax and my car was NOT clean at all, when I addressed them and they made such a big deal about it and gave my a horrible look. Late last year I remember two employees fighting and screaming and one just ended up quitting. They obviously have horrible  management and terrible business practices!\nObviously I will NOT be returning but I wanted to warn others and for those wondering why I kept coming back, I live two minutes away and they kept promising improvements (I should know better this place is only 3-4 years old, what physical things need to be improved). Any how don't come here, they don't appreciate anyone's business."
0,"I was disappointed that it cost $15 to go through it, even if you stay at the hotel. I even showed my room key to the lady at the desk and she still wouldnt let me see it for free."
0,"Bad service? How about NO SERVICE! I was at the \""Sodium Chloride Stuffed Female\"" for 3.5 hours and never once was I approached by a server, greeted, offered a menu or asked if I needed anything; for three and a half hours!! I saw plenty of servers; young ladies more interested in chatting up the young men at the next table over, but never once was approached. Even the bartender seemed bothered to open a couple of bottles of beer for me and my lady. And bottle were all they had. Even the tap system wasn't working and there was no draft beer!!! \n\nIt's too bad, really, how crappy this place is on service. With an outdoor volley ball court, fire pits, and more, I would have really enjoyed lingering and coming back. As it was, the only reason we were there was a friend's birthday. But since I was never offered food, or drinks, one server even just walked past out table as we yelled \""Shots! Shots!\"" And would have just walked away if we hadn't grabbed her and demanded service. This place must be losing $1000s of dollars a night if they treat others the way they treated us. I won't be going back to a place that clearly doesn't value it's customers. I can put up with a lot if I can get good service, but the Salty Se\u00f1orita isn't worth tolerating."
1,"I'm always excited for locally-owned restaurants and was really enthusiastic until the food came.  I'm really only giving them 2 stars, because the service was fine, the patio was nice, and the salsa was good.  However, the food was both bland and barely warm.  I read on their website that the owners are part of the Someburros family, so I thought it would be good.  I was willing to pay twice the price for good Mexican in a higher end atmosphere.  My husband joked that the person who recommended Isabels owed us $40 and an apology. Lol!"
4,"Wherever highschool and college kids hang out ot get lunch, I'm always going to check it out. They (the hs kids) are usually frugal (cheap) and want lots of quantity and decent-good quality. I had literally driven past this place a few times right when I moved into the neighborhood and missed it. I checked it on Yelp, but I was a little put-off by the overall appearance. Don't let it fool you.\n\nVisually the place is right out of something you'd see in TJ, They say they put the money back into the food and not the building. You'll find old plastic lawn chairs and homemade wooden tables to sit at, It adds to the legitimacy of the business - you come here for the food and VERY casual setting. There has been a lot of construction on Power road, which has made access sometimes tough if you're in a lowered car. The parking lot is gravel/dirt. \n\nThe owners and workers inside are so nice. I once bought a candy bar from her son who was selling them for a fundraiser. They are polite and never ever rude.\n\nIt can take a little bit of time to get your order, especially if they are busy. If you're in a jam for time- call it in ahead so it's ready for you. \n\nI have had California burrito, taquitos (rolled tacos), quesadilla, bean rice cheese potato (BRCP) burrito, fries and chips. I haven't had any breakfast burritos... yet.\n\nIf you're hungry, I would suggest the \""Shack\"" size on the burrito size, as its well, duh, bigger. It's not Chipotle with-every-ingredient-possible-sized-burrito big, but its moderately big."
2,"Cute little neighborhood bar. However, not so little, in fact deceiving at first glance. The place has a small restaurant seating area, tables, and then another open seating sectioned off with a dance floor, full stage, KAREOKE! And DJ booth. Definitely didn't see that coming from the street corner. \nMe and my main squeeze decided to stop by late friday night, since the bar is walking distance from our home. We were greeted by security, the place was not empty and not packed. We ordered two drinks (bud lights) = $10. Eeehh I think a little over priced. No drink or food specials. And if you sat near the dance floor there was a drink minimum. We didn't stay long but I can imagine that if we were a little toasty and had some friends with us then MAYBE we would have enjoyed it. Not going to make this my new neighborhood spot, but it wasn't all that bad."
4,"discovered this pub by mistake...great chill, down to earth vibe. bunch of Rugby players were celebrating their game so that made it interesting.\n\ngreat live music too!\n\nhttp://instagram.com/p/eRYh4Yo1Hc/"
1,"Damn, the workers here are terrible. I went to buy an item that was on sale, and they took it up for the front for me and realized the sale tags were out of date so one of the workers disposed of them before I got to the checkout! I was buying $400+ worth of items, and I still had to argue with them to get the advertised price. Next time I went into the store, the $79 signs were back up. They tried to charge me $125. The cashiers and managers always cop major attitude, yet I go back again and again because its a decent store and close to home."
0,"I went to this facility when I moved to Charlotte looking to get botox, which I have had regularly over the last 5 years. I know the drill. This place was highly rated here on yelp, so I felt very confident with bringing my mother along as well. It's in South Park, it has to be top notch, right? Should be worth paying a higher price per unit for professionalism.\n\nThe facility itself is very pretty, the staff was very courteous and friendly. Although it is a bit \""sales\"" vs. \""relaxing\"" in the front with the products, etc. it's fine. Consultation was fine as well. My complaint is with our follow-up to receive the treatment itself.\n\nDr. Greenberg sat down with my mother and I and we told him exactly how many units we wanted and in the locations we wanted. We were both very clear with him.  He nodded his head, and simply did whatever he wanted. I say this, because when we got to the front desk to pay, my mother and I then found out he put in DOUBLE what we both explicitly asked for - and we were floored. So instead of paying around $250 as was expected I was now asked to pay more than $450. I was then told, \""Well he puts in what he thinks you need, then you get free touch-ups in 2 weeks if you're not happy with the results.\"" Wow. Would have been great to know that upfront. At that point, instead of pushing the issue, we were both actually kind of flustered and embarrassed because there were so many people around. Unfortunately, we left - disappointed and later became angry at what transpired. And if that wasn't enough, the botox didn't even seem to last more than a month! I've NEVER had such an experience with botox, so I'm unsure what happened to the formula, etc. but to pay such an amount and then not even have it last was just adding insult to injury. I didn't go back for the \""touch-up\"" because who wants more of that insufficient product in my face? \n\nI tell any friend looking for botox to stay clear of this place. Any facility where they don't listen to your input is not worth visiting. But I'm sure skin treatments, etc. would be fine, I would never recommend anything beyond that at this location. Overpriced, and in this case - simply not worth the money at all."
2,"We had dinner at MIX and had a nice view of the sunset and the strip from where we sat.  I like the indoor/outdoor aspect, in particular the view from the lounge as other reviewers have mentioned.  It is is worth a visit for that alone!\n\nOur table had a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  We chose the Alain Ducasse classics menu, which featured his signature tenderloin as the entree.  \n\nI was disappointed that the sommelier didn't describe each of the wines for us as they were delivered (only the one with the main entree).  At other restaurants, it has been the sommelier and not the waiter who explains the wine.  \n\nThe waiter was a bit over-enthusiastic about the food (almost like he wanted to convince us how good it was) and Alain Ducasse, explaining to us who he is (we already know, that's why we were there!).  \n\nThe second course was a lobster curry that wasn't a favorite of our table.  All of the other dishes (Seabass with asparagus, tenderloin with foie gras, and traditional bhaba rum cake) were all very tasty."
3,"Knowing that this is a Bobby Flay establishment, I had high expectations.\n\nAnd they were met.  The service was elite, the food was fresh, unique and extremely tasty.\n\nThe shrimp tamale appetizer was phenomenal as was the mushroom quesadilla.\n\nThe reason I did not rate it with 5 stars was that my salmon was a undercooked and the coconut cake tasted like it came out of a box.\n\nOtherwise, it was a wonderful experience."
3,"All of the food that I've had here is freakin delicious. There are a million tvs evenly dispersed throughout the whole place - so plan to come here to watch any sport your heart desires.  The service is hit or miss.  I've had wonderful service and some so-so service.  Overall I highly recommend this over Zipps (my old fave) to eat, drink, and watch sports at.  The price of the food is equal to Zipps, but I'm pretty sure Blue 32 has a lot more (and tastier) options.  Great for a quick work lunch, too - they get the food and check to you fast.  Go check this place out!"
4,"The simple sign and tucked away location has kept this place a secret from me. While strolling around Town Square, without any place in mind, I came across this shop. I thought my love of frills was excessive, but this shop puts my wildest imaginations to shame. Some shirts looked like they grabbed a hot glue gun and went crazy with rhinestones. Avoiding the sparkles for men, they had plenty more simple, yet special designs.\n\nThe prices are steep, but they are no more than full price Banana Republic or Express. Also you are guaranteed that you will not see everyone running around in the same or similar looking items. They also carry an even amount of sizes that spans the spectrum. Sometimes, boutiques lean more towards the model demographic, but there were a good supply of S to XXL."
0,"Pounding Loud Music until 3:15!. I reserved an upgraded go room with a strip view.  Room was fine, but the problem is that all rooms that remotely face the Drais Night Club will experience loud pounding music until 3:15.  It was near impossible to sleep.  The hotel knows about this problem very well, as the operator acknowledged numerous complaints."
2,"This restaurant is visually pleasing and has pretty good food. I have been here twice and have gotten pad Thai tofu both visits. I love it! It is a pretty neat setting if you have the option of sitting in the booths that are set flush with the small pond. The waitstaff is friendly enough, but my boyfriend was shrugged off when he pointed out that his glass was cracked and cut his lip."
0,This review is based on the service of Palm's Pool. I was interested in getting a daybed or cabana for Ditch Fridays for my girls and I. We aren't coming to Vegas until Aug but I wanted to get a price range to compare it to another pool party or two and see if it was worth it. I've called 3 times (they have no voicemail) and I've sent  2 emails. No one has ever returned a email and they NEVER answer the phone.\n\nThanks Palms for making my choice that much easier! :)
3,Always good.
1,"The rooms are clean and the service is decent, but the walls are thin enough to follow the television programming in the room on one side of your own while simultaneously enjoying the ecstatic moans and mattress squeaking from your neighbors on the other side. Thankfully the rooms come equipped with a refridgerator, and the constant grumbling  of the ancient cooling unit will do its best to drown out the ruckus in the adjacent rooms. If you're not the type of person who is lulled to sleep by the groan of struggling machinery, unplugging it will only give you the peace and quiet necessary to truly focus on the aforementioned activities of your neighbors.\n\nIf you're checking in here because it's stumbling distance from the establishment next door with women in various states of undress displaying their vertical barre workouts, then this place is for you, and you'll no doubt be either too drunk or too busy to mind the noises coming from the adjacent rooms or your ailing fridge.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in an uninterrupted night of sleep, you'd best look elsewhere. Weeknights or weekends, the pattern is the same. Checking in here is like unwittingly signing a release to take part in a sleep deprivation study."
3,"MMMmmm, burgers!  Cooked perfect, great serivce, lots of choices on the menu."
4,"My daughter has been enrolled in Summerlin Kinder Prep for almost 6 months now.  I have been very happy with our experience here.  Miss Sarah is a great teacher and my daughter loves her.  I appreciate the small class size and the structured time she has during her mornings there.  She looks forward to going everyday and has been learning a lot, preparing her for kindergarten.  I have no complaints, everything runs very smoothly and organized.  I can easily communicate with either her teacher (Miss Sarah), or the Administrator Tracy at any time.  Overall Great Preschool and greatly appreciated!!"
3,"Look past the extremely tacky conveyor belt style whiskey history ride and you'll see a fantastic intro to whiskey tasting. The staff are great and their knowledge of Scotland's whiskey history is great. You'll get to understand/taste the diverse range of tastes whiskey can offer, see the largest collection of whiskey (great for some classy vacation photos) and keep a glass. Worth it."
0,"I ordered the fish and chips which was recommended as a 'best seller' by the server. It was 3 greasy pieces of fish, a couple of very skinny breaded shrimp, a spoonful of cole slaw and a few fries. This meal couldnt even be considered good at a fast food place for a third the price ($11.99).  \nService was fine, nice decor.\nPoor Food!"
4,"Dr. Liu and his staff are amazing!!  They are very courteous, professional, and do an outstanding job. Unlike most other dentist, Dr. Liu does the cleaning himself. He is very meticulous and it gives you a piece of mind that you are getting quality attention. He is extremely knowledgeable, gives you a straight assessment of the situation, and provides choices for the best results. Also, what I love about the office is that the whole staff work so well with each other and have an amazing sense of humor!"
3,"I love the pizza here. I guess I am supposed to comment more. However, I will just stick with my original statement that the pizza is great and deserves a four star review based only on the quality/taste of the pizza."
3,"Petit resto p\u00e9ruvien dans Verdun qui en apparence n'a l'air de rien mais qui cache une exp\u00e9rience tout \u00e0 fait agr\u00e9able.  Fait int\u00e9ressant et \u00e9trange, ce resto offre de la bouffe p\u00e9ruvienne, mais \u00e9galement de la bouffe mexicaine et canadienne (???), comme quoi on cherche \u00e0 plaire \u00e0 un large public.\n\nJe suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 3 reprises et \u00e0 chaque fois j'ai eu le m\u00eame service, soit tout \u00e0 fait souriant et chaleureux, comme si on faisait parti de la famille.  Je n'ai pas eu la chance de go\u00fbter \u00e0 grands choses car, malgr\u00e9 un grand choix de plats, je reviens toujours aux calmars frits servis avec une salade d'oignon et pommes de terres.  Les portions sont tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses.  J'ai bu de la sangria qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne.\n\nLorsque je quitte le resto, je suis toujours tr\u00e8s satisfait et mon estomac est toujours bien rempli!!  Le prochaine fois, je me fais un devoir d'essayer autre chose que les calmars...quoique... :))"
3,"I've never stayed here, but I would definitely recommend checking them out if you're visiting Fremont. Its a fun atmosphere, cheap for drinks and gambling, and plenty of fun times for all! The machines may be a bit old, but the servers come around often for drinks and the people at the card tables are super friendly and more patient than they tend to be at the strip, so its great if you are still learning poker or blackjack, etc."
1,"I've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots... usually a decent experience... This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).  \n\nThis particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.  \n\nThe place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \""yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\"" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \""really??? are you serious??\"" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \n\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?.. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.\n\nall in all, I'm not sure I'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever.  Sorry, but I've experienced better."
1,Great place to go if you want to deal with a complete bitch of a doctor who has absolutely no patience for questions and talks to you like you're an idiot for asking. Otherwise fine I suppose.
1,Went to lunch.  No lunch specials.  Device so-so.   The shrimp cocktail was horrible.  No flavor.  Shrimp were not deveined and tasted old.  The music was blasting for the liking of the servers and not the customers.  The lemon fish was not good.  I would fire the cook and focus on the customers.  There is much better around the area.
1,It's great they serve alcohol and all but probably one of the worst pedicures I've received. Not sure if it's cause the girl giving me it was my peer and that's kind of awkward. A lot of the dead skin did not get taken off. The polish is uneven. Completely chipped less than a week later. I really loved the idea of this place since I live in ayrsley but I don't think I will be back. Driving to South Park is so much more worth it.
0,Me and my wife ate here because we love Indian fry bread. We ordered the little Vincie which is suppose to be steak and potato.  This was a BIG disappointment! The whole dish had no flavor and the steak pieces were about the size of a pea and hardly even but a few pieces of steak at that! And that is no exaggeration. We each order the little Vincie and a small soft drink and it cost 21.09! Way over priced for no flavor and no steak! We were still hungry when we left. We are so disappointed in the flavor and the quality of the food that we were compelled to write our first review. We will never go back to Arizona Frybread!\n\nR. Weiss
4,The Kalua Pork is off the charts!!  Best Hawaiian BBQ shop I have tried in Vegas (or anywhere for that matter).  I highly recommend this place for some great Hawaiian food.
2,"Ive been coming here every now and then for the past year and theyve improved a lot. Their sushi used to be sloppy and not made with care but I came here recently and its better, their chicken bento box is great too with noodles.\nSometimes they run out of ingredients for the rainbow roll (which is my favorite roll )and it tastes plain.\n and I feel sometimes with the right ingredients it still has no flavor :(\nanother thing, they need to stay on top of things, because I went there and there were no utensils or chopsticks or soy sauce packets and when I asked he said they were there... uh no.\n\nBut I definitely recommend the hawaiian roll if you like spicy food."
4,"My favorite place!  Especially good service from Joe.  He was tentative without being bothersome almost down to an art-form.  The food leaves me speechless, and the cheese list is provoking vivid dreams.  If nothing else, go for the cheese and wine because it's the best in the city."
3,"After a weekend involving Hakkasan and two visits to Marquee, my girlfriend and I were on the hunt for a bar that focused less on the \""untz-untz\"" factor and more on a sort of laidback, breezy vibe. We were quite fortunate to find our into Bar Vdara while taking a stroll through CityCenter!\n\nTucked away near the front lobby of the hotel from which it takes its name, this bar offers plenty of comfortable seating and a solid selection of the day's sporting events on a number of TVs (sadly, without any sound - but that's to be expected due to Bar Vdara's centralized location in the lobby). Coolest of all is the trendy, contemporarily-styled outdoor area attached to the bar, where fans spin lazily overhead and cozy, Bond villain-style seating cushions may just lull you into a drunken snooze if you're not careful.\n\nThe extended happy hour at Bar Vdara (11am - 4pm, Monday through Friday) is just as convenient as it is practical. We wandered in with the intent of browsing through the drink menu...and ended up walking out pretty hammered.\n\nOur server was helpful and informative with her descriptions of the variety of beers on hand. It definitely seemed as though she could've used some help - at times it seemed as though she was serving every guest in the bar on her own - but she made sure to check on us regularly, even just to say that she'd be getting back to us as quickly as she could. It is worth noting that we dropped by pretty early in the day, so that may have had a great deal to do with the delays that we experienced. \n\nAlthough I can't remember what craft beer I ordered, I do recall the relatively modest $7 price tag (especially considering just how dark of a beer I had requested) as being quite the deal in terms of Las Vegas drink pricing. Although only a handful of craft beers are made available at happy hour pricing, they're served by the bottle, and you don't feel like you're being skimped on. \n\nIn the interest of maintaining my buzz, I also ordered a Jack & Coke (also at discounted happy hour pricing!), which was served to me in a deconstructed, unexpectedly hip fashion (see photo). The fact that the drink hadn't been mixed was a welcome surprise, as it allowed me to measure my own ideal ratio of liquor versus soda. Much like the way in which my drink was served, the sheer state of drunkenness that I experienced (thanks to guzzling on a near-empty stomach) came somewhat out of left field. Good stuff.\n\nI'd definitely come back to this bar again if I was looking to enjoy a more mellow environment to down a drink or two. My advice: don't sleep on that extended happy hour - it's just another Vegas excuse to be drunk before noontime."
2,"Now that I live in a proper city, I no longer eat at places like Chili's. But that doesn't mean I don't still have a bit of fondness in my heart for the big C. \n\nBesides how can you beat the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato) served with a side of homestyle fries?"
4,"My First Piano, Josh, and his team, have been nothing but a positive experience. We got the piano we wanted with exceptional service, personalized service, fast delivery, and some perks that we were not expecting. The play period is awesome to try the piano out with no interest! I love that the piano matches my home and that I was able to purchase the fabric for the bench. Truly a great company that is run professionally and with great integrity."
0,"They washed my car and cleaned it the way I asked them to (no smells inside; just dust with a damp cloth) but..........they STOLE a handmade seat liner and had the nerve to get angry at ME because I accused them of not putting it back after they cleaned inside. They insisted I was in the wrong and must've left it at home.  THEY STOLE IT plain and simple.  Never, never again."
0,"Don't ask me if I stayed here, because I'll tell you right now:\n\nI have never stayed here, and I will NEVER stay here. Although it looks amazing from the outside, we went inside to go to a bar or a club, and the second we opened the outer doors, the smell hit us like a ton of bricks! It smells so bad in the Venetian, I don't think I'll ever be back to visit, let alone pay my good money to stay here. It literally smells like a staircase that has been pissed on for years, mixed with stale urinal cakes from a dive bar bathroom. \n\nPlease know that this is NO EXAGGERATION.\n\nWe about faced and got the hell out of dodge, because there is no way that I can have a great time with friends when it smells like a port-o-san.\n\nI'm not sure how there are people who went recently and have not noticed this problem, but it is out of hand."
1,"Horrible! my husband and I decided to eat here since I am from NY and he is from MD, we both love NY style pizza.........which this is not! it looked good when it came to the table but as soon as I took a bite I was very dissapointed, we got 2 small pizzas first was a pizza with red sauce cheese and shrooms and the second was a white margherita pizza, the red sauce has absolutely no flavor to it, I mean NO flavor it tasted like water seriously! the white pizza was the better place of the two but still wasnt worth what we paid. its expensive for what it is and the topping are priced way to high between 2-4 dollars per topping. the only thing I can say good about this place is that the cheesecake is made fresh in house and is very good, I got a strawberry cheesecake and hubby got the oreo which he and  I both loved,the strawberry actually has strawberries in the mix its not on top like most others. I would never go back for the pizza but if I was in the area and wanted cheesecake I would stop in and get it to go. Oh and when hubby and I walked into this place there was about 5 servers or whoever just standing there in a group talking,but when we walked in they just stared at us as we walked to our table,didnt say anything just stared it was really awkward!!!!"
2,"Pros: Lovely rooms,  great spa prices, awesome pool, free shuttle to the strip, grocery delivery, friendly service. \n\nCons: Only 2 places to eat: Denny's and \""Tahiti Joe's\"", kind of far from the strip, can feel isolated if you don't have a car. No casino. Not much to do in the area. \n\nWe traded in a time share for a week at this place and it was an overall pleasant experience! \n\nThis is a nice place to stay if you're going to be in town for a while. They have free grocery delivery that you can arrange to have done when you arrive (it is rather expensive though), or if you have a car there's a Whole Foods nearby. We did not have a car, but we got some groceries and spent most of our time eating out on the strip. A shuttle to the strip leaves every 30 minutes, and it takes about 15 minutes to get there. \n\nI went to the spa, and had a great, inexpensive massage. The place is modest and no-frills, but the staff is accommodating and friendly and the rooms are comfortable and clean. \n\nThe lazy river is neat!  Unfortunately we went in the winter and the pool was supposed to be on and heated, but it was unseasonably cold so they closed it (jacuzzis were open though)."
0,"A terrible experience.  I booked the room using hotels.com and prepaid but when I arrived they could not find my booking.  I had to call hotels.com and then they had to call the hotel.  The front desk clerk kept giving me room keys that did not work.  Upon checkout we were running late and called for a later checkout.  We were curtly told \""No\"" that we had to be out by 1200 noon.  At 1230 they started to call the room and sent a housekeeper to stand outside the front door as I was loading the car.  Then a maintenance/security guard arrived to watch me load the car.  We were out by 1245.  Oh yes, and the previous day they decided to do construction in the room above us so that we could not sleep.  This hotel needs a massive lesson in hospitality."
0,"Went here for white tips & pedicure. The experience was not the best, and I def won't be going back there again. She was rude the whole time and rushed through my pedicure and nails. My heart design she drew is all jacked up barely looks like a heart. Will never spend my money here again. They were sitting there talking in another language the whole time (which doesn't bother me) but she never said 2 words to me the whole time except asking if I was going to leave a tip when I was done. Rude, not worth 55 dollars at all :( ugh."
1,I guess I should have spoke up when my group decided we should try Cheeseburger while waiting for our show to start. I maybe eat 2 hamburgers a year and I don't eat cheese. I just figured there would still be a selection of other foods. Well I was wrong. There were about a gazillion hamburger choices and a handful of other entrees. I ended up going with a chicken ceaser which cost me a whopping $12 and I still left hungry. I guess people are willing to pay a lot more for less when they are caught up in the hustle and bustle of the vegas strip.
2,"I gave Ra a 3-star rating because of the food but the atmosphere is very entertaining.  The sushi is not great unless your really hungry and have been drinking a bit. A lot of people who go to Ra anyway are usually hipsters and sushi newbe's who only try the California roll, Vegas roll or anything that is aesthetically appealing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging out with friends, drinking and having a good time at Ra but I solely do not go there for the sushi.\n\nFor an entertaining time and drinks: go to RA. \n\nFor good sushi: look elsewhere"
0,"Really does not merit a star !  CONMAN !   RUDE !   DO NOT CALL THIS GUY BECAUSE YOU WILL REGRET IT ! Called for rental property, tenant said he wanted her to turn it off !  Put everything on dry ice for two days !  Would return Monday to replace ice maker. I tried to save a buck and got %#*~%#}.  The worst part is that I have great tenants, and they got really upset !  WTF DUDE ?  GYPSY ?  Get a freaking real job !"
4,I can say this place is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Madison area! I had to try a couple of other vietnamese restaurants near Madison during its renovation construction. I realized that I must thank Saigon Noodle for its great food.  Now no longer waiting too much in line with the recent renovation.
2,"Have eaten from here twice so far, and enjoyed it both times.  I work at one of the local medical clinics and can't leave the building during my shift, so one of my coworkers was nice enough to go pick it up for me.  Both times I had some combination of tacos and beef burritos, and had the fries once.  Both times, the food was hot and fresh and the taco shells nice and crunchy.  Del Taco is my favorite non-authentic place to get Mexican (Tex Mex / Americanized Mexican) food, and I've been to many of them on several occasions.  For all but one location (not mentioned here), the food is consistently good, and the service is usually faster than their competitors that serve a similar menu.  In all, I expect to eat here many more times in the future given its consistent quality and proximity to my work location."
3,"GINORMOUS airport and easy to get lost. If you fly into the older terminal, you'll have to take a shuttle ride to get to baggage claim--that's how huge it is. Anyway, this airport is one of the highest trafficked in the country which isn't surprising. If you end up in the newer terminal, you feel like you're already on the strip with slot machines, stores and restaurants surrounding you. It's sooo Vegas with such a glitzy airport.\n\nIt's crazy to see the long lines going through security, but they seem like a well-oiled machine here. It's impressive that  everything is pretty organized, and lines go by quickly."
4,Great Hotel. The service was wonderful and cleans were extremely clean. I especially like the indoor garden that they change according to the 4 seasons. The buffet was awesome with plenty of choices and the price was just right for what you get in return.
2,"I was excited to try this restaurant after nearly a year since trying it last.  But I think my expectations exceeded the results.  I tried the Taos Pork Tenderloin and was disappointed because the pork was cut into medallions, which I believe is the reason they were dry.  Frankly, I was happier with the side items: my mixed vegetables were good and cooked to perfection and the Jalapeno potatoes are awesome but apportioned too small.\n\nMy dinner companion had the Carlsbad Ribeye with which he was very happy.  I guess it was me who thought that the meal should be more balanced than this huge piece of meat (20 ounces) served with a tortilla smaller than my hand.\n\nI remember the first time I visited, thinking that the waterfalls were an unusual touch, but the more I sat there, the more I found myself thinking of Gilligan's Island.  A little too corny for me, I guess.\n\nOur service was great though; both the host and the server were really friendly."
2,"In general, I do not like eating at buffets but this one was pretty enjoyable."
4,"I had a bartender for my Sunday football get together with a bunch of my friends. Bryn the bartender was super energetic and added to the energy of the party, not to mention she was super cute. She also thought of some creative new drinks for the girls. I have tried other bartending services, but Raise the Bar definitely exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend them for your next party and I will be using them again."
3,"We went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by \""family style\"". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes..."
3,"Really good veggie lo-mein. That was what my friend ordered. I had the teriyaki chicken. The teriyaki sauce was really good, the chicken was a little grisselly and WAY too huge of pieces. It would be nice if they had cut it up a bit more. The gal at counter was super nice and accommodating. Thumbs up for good service!  I'll be back to try a few more options!"
4,Had my daughters 10th bday party there and it was great. I  would recommend this place to anyone..
3,"Margaritas by the pitcher were very good.  And strong.\n\nThe taco and enchilada combo were very solid.\n\nThe chips were never empty and oh so tasty.\n\nI'm not sure why this place got bashed so hard either.\n\nThe Presidential table was just across the way from us, but didn't glow or anything.\n\nThe prices were reasonable, but everything in Phoenix was reasonably priced.\n\nThen again, I was drinking for three hours straight at the baseball game right before coming here.  Nah, the food was good anyway."
1,"Very limited selection. This is a smaller Walmart location. Cashiers are nice, but very over worked. Out of the 19 or so check stands, there are 3-4 open on average. Lines are horrible to checkout."
4,"Really a 4.5 in my eyes, but I will round up to a 5 b/c Trump has badass room service.  \n\nGot a deal through HotWire and paid a decent price for 2 nights (Friday/Saturday).  This hotel is sliiiightly off the strip, but is still directly across a small side street from Fashion Show Mall.  It made it very convenient for us to get breakfast at one of two Starbucks inside the mall.  Mmmm...Also, because of its location, when taxis came to pick us up, the drivers took Industrial Blvd, which was waaaay less crowded than Las Vegas Blvd.  This saved us a lot of time and cab fare!  HOOORAY!\n\nThere is no self-parking lot here, so be ready with some cash to tip the valet people.  They are all very friendly and will signal for a cab for you 24/7.  Trump also has shuttles going to Caesar's Palace and Wynn every day.  I can't recall the hours exactly, but I think for CP, the shuttle service ends at midnight every night.\n\nAll rooms come with a King-sized bed and a Queen-sized couch bed.  There is even a kitchenette and roomy fridge for those who want to make their own meals/snacks.  Be sure to save room for the delicious fries and tiramisu from room service though!  Trust me!  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with this hotel.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to stay at a hotel that doesn't have a casino (GASP!)and is 100% non-smoking.  You are charged a little less than $23/day for resort fees, which allows you to use the pool, internet, gym, and a few other ammenities.  So people, use their stuff!!!\n\nOh yes, be sure to lounge around by the family-friendly poolside (nothing fancy, but a good place to relax and cool off).  Free towels, lounge chairs, and umbrellas.  Cabanas can be reserved as well (not sure if it costs anything)."
1,"Not one of the best Cirque du Soleil shows out there. I think the only reason I was able to sit and watch the entire show without falling asleep was because I was really buzzing by the time I got in the theater. I was only impressed by the revolving stage which is a floor stage and can be tilted and manipulated to become a wall. The other impressive moment in the show was when one of the performers was running on top of gigantic spinning wheel while jump roping at the same time.\n\nOther than that, I was actually quite disappointed.  I thought KA was all about fire and flames.  We only experience that here and there in bits.  At the end of the show, there was a finale of spinning sparklers which blinded me more than anything.  Not to mention, I was confused most of the time as to what the storyline was about.  It was kind of a \""watch as you go and use common sense\"" feeling."
1,"Decided to take the family by one Sunday afternoon during late summer, when they were set up in the parking lot of a local eatery. When we walked up, it seemed as if we were interrupting the kid with the headphones on. There was a nice selection of super random pops, which is why we came in the first place. They were OK. I expected more for the price I paid. All in all, overpriced, and hopefully the kid is having a better day."
4,"The selection of books on food, wine, and cooking is fabulous. I'm really impressed by this bookstore. I found things I had wanted for a long time, and found them easily -- this may be the best-organized used bookstore I've ever seen. I hope to return whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."
2,"I haven't been in to the rooms, but I've walked through the casino a number of times. I took a better look at the games they have to offer on my latest visit and was surprised at how much larger the place was than I thought from the front of it.  It's not as nice as it's sister property in New Orleans, but it's also much older. The drink service was good and all in all it wasn't a bad time. \n\n The card readers on the machine all seemed to be a bit finicky when it came to inserting my players club card; i found the bank of machines we wanted to play on and had to figure out which of them would actually accept the cards. The ticket redemption machine was not working either so I had to go to the cashier to collect."
2,"Ok so I have been here twice now on lunch.  Let me start by saying the subs are delicious.  Everything is fresh, top quality meats, breads.  The only \""but\"" that was the cause of three stars is my biggest pet peeve.  They seem to rush so fast to get u out the door they screwed up my sub both times I was there.   No onions I hate onions and got them both times.  Slow Down, think about what your doing, and think how the customers feel about being shoved off like that by the employees.  I do highly recommend the place maybe just shout or sing ur special request so they remember it."
4,"I'm a hungry out-of-state contractor looking for a simple Subway breakfast flatbread.  But the Yelp reviews tempted me to try something local.\n\nAnd glad I did.  Sandella's had flatbreads, paninis, and soups freshly prepped at 10AM.  I ordered a burrito for the guy on the work site and the Tuscan Chicken Panini for myself.\n\nUnfortunately I had many other stops, I didn't get to the panini until 2PM that day.  Maybe I was famished.  Or may it simply was awesome.  But it was one of the better paninis I've had in the parking lot of a tile store.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Do what I say not what I do.  I had no after-math issue eating a 4 hour old sandwich; but one should really refrigerate all foods that are not immediately consumed."
4,"Most of their flavors are really good. My fav is the red bean or blueberry. They are also the only place in town that has diamond ice, a must try! Very consistent and very good."
2,Cool pool hall.  The front is a small neighborhood bar type of place that has good beer prices and almost everything seemed to be on special the night we were there.  The pool hall in the back was much bigger than I expected it to be.  There were a lot of tables and plenty of room.  If you see the \u20ac20 note hanging up on the wall that was from a friend of mine that donated it during our trip to Pittsburgh.
1,Food was ok and service was horrible.
3,"Miracle Mile Shops are connected to the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino and Elara Hilton Hotels which, I usually stay when I'm in town.  \n\nVery convenient to come right downstairs to shops, restaurants and entertainment.  Now, they have 2 ABC stores at MMS (memories of Oahu, Hawaii).  The deco or ambiance of MMS.  The shops are sometimes over priced if you're a bargain hunter you need to go to the Premium Outlets (North and South). \n\nWe had fun at Pampas Brazilian Restaurant and Cheese Burgers located next to the V theater. Show a few good shows and had a few good meals."
2,"If you can imagine it, it's here with an M&M logo or characters stamped on it.\n\nThis is commercialism cranked to 11. Seeing consumerism go overboard repulsed me somewhat. I mean, I love M&Ms but this was just too much. While I thought it was cool to see the candy section filled with M&Ms of dozens of unusual colors, I couldn't get past the fact that they were priced far higher than a bag you could pick up at any grocery store. Different M&M colors aren't worth a higher price in my opinion.\n\nTourist prices for a touristy store. But from the crowds that jam into this multi-level structure, it is obvious that people love spending their money on stuff covered with M&M commercial branding."
3,My simple tongue really enjoys the breakfast here. I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant- mind you I had to wait about 7minutes to get a coffee after being seated on a saturday on a particular occasion. I recommend this place as a great restaurant for simplicity.
2,"Great food. Not impressed with Management staff.\n\nWe walked in around 6p on a Sat. night. Even the hottest uptown restaurants keep a few tables for walk ins. The manager had a bit of an attitude because we were a walk in over the weekend. Get over yourself. This isnt NYC. This is freaking Ballentyne!!\n\nThe place was packed and we sat at the bar. All the food was pretty good - more tapas style. Meatballs were OK, not great. \n\nI did get introduced to a lovely Malbac called Llama from the super friendly bartender.\n\nI do like the romantic dim lighting atmosphere here, but the manager turned me off enough to lead me to explore other Mediterranean/greek places to find my fav."
1,"If you want the best Marbella experience, visit their beautifully designed website, and then stop there. Marbella crafts perfectly mediocre, unimaginative tapas. I have been here thrice and do not foresee a fourth visit - although, the stuffed mushrooms were enjoyable enough. The paella was particularly bad (dry and tasteless). The service and decor are both passable. To be safe, just pass on this place all together."
1,"I was excited to go the buffet at Paris after having been there years ago and having fond memories of food, food, and more food.\n\nThe place turned out to be sad.  The food had been sitting under heat lamps for too long, the waitress took too long to bring us drinks, the desserts were picked through and melting, and even the waitresses looked sad dressed like wenches.  The only redeeming piece was the crepe maker.\n\nNext time, I'm going back to the Bellagio or Rio.  No more Le Village."
2,"3.5 \n\nI had high hopes for a Vegas Cirque show, but it delivered just short of what I expected. Since I have only seen one other Cirque performance, which happened to be their traveling show Kooza, I was imagining at least 5xs the excitement at a permanent show. \n\nIt was a last minute decision to watch Mystere and we got tickets for around $85. We probably had the worst seating in the theater which wasn't bad at all. I found that Mystere had about the same amount of acts as Kooza. \n\nPros: The acts were still amazing as expected. The costumes and and makeup were very creative and lively. The staging had different elements that the traveling show lacked. I absolutely loved the music.\n\nCons: I found that the comedic relief wasn't as funny as the Koozas. And I basically found Kooza and Mystere at a pretty dead even race as to which was more entertaining. \n\nOverall: Still a pretty good show, but I just left wanting more.  Perhaps it was because I had seen Kooza before hand and was using that to compare. I would say if it is your first Cirque show, you should still watch it! But not if you've seen Kooza or any other performances."
0,"I spent 25 minutes reading reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Mistake.  I wish I'd tried somewhere else for dry cleaning.\n\nI got ready to wear my favorite shirt out and discovered it had all kinds of stains on it (that amazingly weren't there before!).  A friend and I had planned our clothing to match for a special night so it was a scramble to change everything because the shirt was a mess.  It hadn't occurred to me it would return dirtier than I gave it to them, so I hadn't checked it beforehand.\n\nIf you try here, I highly recommend checking all of your clothes before leaving the store.  More than that, I highly recommend exploring somewhere else."
4,"I must admit that I had low expectations for this show, especially since I saw the very disappointing \""Living Dead Musical\"" in this very same venue.   However, as you can tell from my rating, I really liked the show.  The props were great, the choreography was fantastic, the performers had charisma & the music was good.  I really can't find anything I disliked about this show.  Well done, guys!"
1,"2.5 Stars\n\nRed, White & Blue is one of my default spots to go to for breakfast during my work conferences at the Mandalay Bay. It has some pretty decent food for on-the-go or for a quick bite sitting down, but I find it way over priced. On the other hand, what isn't over priced in Vegas?\n\nFor my sit down meal I ordered the Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese, and Mushroom Omelette for $14.  I looked at my dish when it came out and it was interesting. I noticed the egg was cooked like a flat tortilla and then all the ingredients were wrapped in it. At times I just found myself eating egg or just the ingredients.  I found this to be a unique way to cook the omelette, but I still prefer all my ingredients to be melded together and infused with the egg. This way it ensures I get an equal distribution of ingredients with each bite. \n\nAll omelettes are served with house potatoes with onions, peppers and herbs, but I'm not a big fan of house potatoes so I asked for a substitution. My server gladly substituted the potatoes for fruit. I ended up with some cantaloupe that was very sweet and juicy.\n\nOn-the-go, I tried their Smoked Salmon Platter that comes with a toasted bagel with Atlantic Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onions, and Capers. This was a lot better than their omelette. I remember this being fairly expensive as well, but this dish is about the same price everywhere else in Vegas.\n\nOverall, Red, White & Blue serves up a quick, but moderately tasting breakfast line up."
3,"This will be my go-to place for Indian in central Phoenix. I am pleasantly delighted with the flavors and textures- the chicken in the butter chicken is tender and the samosa's outer shell is firm yet flaky to hold the mildly spiced vegetables, namely potatoes and peas. I have identified that one of my guilty pleasures in the carb family is garlic naan. Man, it's good here. The dining room is bright and colorful- it backs up to the classy Bandaids club. I suppose it adds to the \""exotic ness\"" of the experience. All in all, I would love to come back and try ordering off the menu. The buffet is $8.99 on weekends and I got to try lots of wonderful things."
2,"Hopefully you have better luck that me finding this place on your first turn into the Shopping Center....hint hint it's beside the Starbucks. They have to do something about the trees that over up the sign!\n\nAnyway, enough on that let's get to the food:\n\nI shared an order of the rotolis and the Napoli pizza. The rotolis were absolutely delish! They came out hot and fresh with just the right amount of garlic and olive oil. And dipped in that marinara sauce....yummy! They are apparently not on the menu anymore but definitely ask about them because they are worth ordering! The Napoli pizza comes topped with ricotta, meatballs and tomato sauce. I enjoyed it but the crust could have been a bit crisper!\n\nI'm up for giving this place another try....I hear that BBQ Chicken Pizza is worth a second visit!"
1,"Instead of a warm, polite greeting on my first visit to this office, I was greeted by a snotty , curt receptionist at the front desk named SARAH. She needs a \""People Skills 101\"" refresher course. This first point of contact is not serving this Dental office well. Dr Cravatta seemed nice enough. He probably can handle simple, routine dental procedures just fine. I didn't get the impession he was up for anything too challenging or complicated. Nor did I sense he wanted to go the extra mile for you. There are far more highly skilled dental specialists with friendly staff members in this valley, than to be bothered by this."
0,DON'T EVER GO HERE FOR ANYTHING!!! ITS TERRIBLE!! I got a regular oil change here and they broke something while doing that and didn't tell me. When I checked my car a couple days later I went back to complain and he finally admitted to me that he knew it was broken and he forgot to put it on my receipt!! What liars !!! AVOID This Place !!!
2,"luggage upstairs and dinner downstairs...thursday evening and seating plenty...large choice menu of mostly seafood...few \""land lovers\"" selection of pork, steak and chicken...taking an alaskan halibut blackened...choice of two sides?...doubling up on the carbohydrates...mac 'n' cheese and baked potato requesting...halibut overcooked dry and some disappointment...tasty mac 'n' cheese sinfully good...standard baked potato soft, hot and melting butter...admiring neighbor's bouillabaisse of half lobster tail, mussels, fish chunks, clams, dungeness and shrimp...deliciously consuming...mistake with halibut and fish order...get the cioppiono or bouillabaisse!"
2,"I don't have a whole lot to say about this place. I usually tend to write pretty lengthy reviews but on this place I think I would just like to list my pros and cons of the half dozen or so times I've been here. \n\nPros:\nTeriyaki bowls are pretty cheap\nNice size servings\nThe seating area is usually very clean \nThey are fairly quick at getting your food out to you\nThe beef is really well cooked. It's tender and not at all rubbery (like some other rice bowl places I've been to)\n\nCons:\nEverything is served in styrofoam. Not too appetizing if you're getting sushi.\nThe sushi is WAY too expensive for the quality. It's not BAD sushi, it's just not worth $10 a roll.\nThe staff in the evening are usually 18 (I'm of course guessing) year olds that don't like to be bothered if they're on their cell phones. Sometimes the girls there are dressed a little inappropriately for being at work. That's of course just my opinion.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Nothing fancy. Edible and decent for the price as long as you're not getting sushi."
4,"It took me forever to finally decide and take driving lessons. Sure was worth the wait though! I had my six hour lesson with Terry and he was the most patient, sweetest and informative instructor! He made me feel comfortable driving behind the wheel right away and he provides so much confidence in you that a beginning driver like myself makes me feel that I've been doing this for a long time. He gives you so many pointers and tips that will instill on you every time you're behind the wheel. I highly recommend Terry if you're looking for a great  and informative instructor to teach your teens or adults that are just beginners with driving. Very thankful and glad that he was my instructor! :)"
0,Since I didn't get to have my steak and eggs for dinner the night before we made it a point to come down for breakfast. Prices have gone up and we didn't realize it till we got the bill. $20 for measley steak and eggs plate. Nice buttery eggs and crisp hashbrowns but the steak was sinewy and rimmed with gristle.
4,"I went to the show out of scientific curiosity and with a lot of skepsis. Well, I witnessed that after a couple of minutes a group of seemingly intelligent people is transformed into a bunch of suggestible zombies that do nasty things. Beware: this is an adult show. If you're easily offended, don't go there.  \n\nAs for December '09 the show is called \""Hypnosis Unleashed\"" and is performed in Las Vegas Tropicana"
3,"I really liked this place. It's well designed but not too fancy, it's pretty casual and not crazy loud. Service was decent and the price wasn't too bad. Went for dinner with some friends so we all shared and tasted several items. The BBQ brisket & the jalapeno poppers were the highlight of the meal. I heard rumor that the lamb burger is really good, but it was devoured before i could try it... Also and for some reason unbeknownst to me this place had some magical PBR, none of my table knew why but this was the best tasting $4 beer we'd ever had."
4,"Walked in here an tried only clam chowder , as I know this is the only place in Vegas that serve chowder in a bun, very tasty and creamy. Place is very clean and modern;)"
1,"Caveat under new ownership. In fact I only rate it 2 stars because the waiter was so very eager to please, the lasagna was a 1 star loser.  Granted 2:30 is late for lunch so I won't hold it against them that I paid dinner prices or that it took 20 minutes.\nHowever the lasagna was served cold, the pasta was hard, the meat in it was a solid brick and the sauce tasted of catsup.  An unsatisfactory dish improperly reheated : fail.\n\nThe waiter did ask me several times if everything was alright, if I liked the food etc.\nI tend to make suggestions when I think there's room for improvement but I didn't believe there was a point here so I lied and told him everything was fine."
3,"- Decor - \nEven as I was pulling up to the restaurant in the complex I was getting giddy. I could tell just driving by that the decor and ambiance itself is something I'll fall madly in love with. And I was right! Their style is how I want to base my whole life around! My future home, my product labeling (if I were to sell something), my coffee shop (if I were to open one), my clothing store (if I were to somehow build one), my children. Yes even my children. I want their whole being to somehow represent this simple, minimalistic, vintage style. It was a beautiful day and they kept their doors open, but even if they didn't this restaurant is very bright and spacious with simple accent pieces to make it more elegant. For example, the chalk art on the walls, and the deep burgundy booths. LOVE LOVE LOVE!\n\n- Ordering - \nYou order at the counter and they give you a number marker. They have special deals everyday! On Saturdays they offer a $7.99  lunch special - side salad or soup, 1 piece of garlic bread, and a build it your own pasta. You get to choose the pasta and sauce but any additional toppings is extra charge. Ze boyfriend went with the Smokehouse Mac and ordered Cauliflower Gratin. As you finish with your order, and you walk towards the tables, you can see a small section of  fresh produce piled like at the grocery market behind the counters and they also keep their working space very open so you can see the cleanliness of the kitchen. \n\n- Food - \nThe food didn't take too long to come out. My caesar salad was delicious and was very fresh. As my pasta, I ordered a basil pesto wheat pasta with broccoli and mushrooms, it was alllrightt. Too bland for my taste. I can only say the Smokehouse Mac was only okay too. It was too sweet, but I guess that should be expected if you're going for that hickory smoked bbq flavor. The Cauliflower Gratin sealed the deal on 4 stars rather than 5. I could have let my experience with the rest of the meal slide, but not the Cauliflower Gratin. Although it was good, it got me questioning if they had Paula Dean back there preparing it cause that thing was just straight up fat and oil. I posted a picture to show the insane amount of oily greasy mess that took up the bottom half of the bowl. The description on the menu said it was seasoned with parmesean and mozzarella cheeses but I didn't realize by seasoned, they really meant 'swimming in', I tried one just so I could review it, and that's all I could have. \n\nThat heart-threatening side item won't keep me away though. I'm still very interested in coming back and trying all the other items."
3,Was looking for a great steak dinner with all the fixings and I found it.  Would have given 5 stars but the plate my steak came out on was so HOT I burned my finger..left a mark. So unnecessary!!!
3,"I can't believe it took me this long to visit the PPM. I've always been a fan of the Strip district and the PPM adds another must-hit destination for a Saturday in the strip.\n\nIt is a collection of vendors - most are the small/med sized Pittsburgh businesses that don't have a full shop, but can run a solid operation out of a weekend stall.\n\nWe visited for the first time when we were on an adventure to find the Pittsburgh Marshmellow company (awesome/amazing!). But while there we sampled tons of baked goods.  I wanted to buy pierogies and pick up a growler from East End - but I was running out of hands and time.\n\nAnd they have bathrooms!\n\nI will definitely make this a regular destination on the weekends!"
4,100x better than anything In n Out could shit out into a wrapper and try to pass off as food.\n\nSo glad these guys finally opened up here... now if only they could get a location going closer to my house...
2,"The setting here is fantastic, overlooking the faux canals of the Venetian with gondoliers rowing past and giant ceilings painted as the blue sky. I just wish the food here was as good. The service was efficient but the meal itself was on the bland side and lacked the flavors and spices that I would have expected from someplace billing itself as a taqueria. The salsa did not have any kick to it. The meat in my tacos seemed as it had been cooked and then left in a heating device before it was served. The tortillas were at least fresh and fluffy. It was not a bad meal overall, but it could have been better."
3,"My husband and I got our dog's 2nd birthday cake here! And yes I know it might sound silly but they had such cute pupcakes (cupcakes) and regular cakes that you can get personalized. They also had really cute treats! The staff was super friendly and helpful! I don't normal dress my dogs in clothes but they has such cute basketball jerseys! My husband and I have opposing teams so it doesn't seems like we will agree on this anytime soon.\n\nCute store, cute stuff. Get your dog something nice!"
3,Agave Blue has a great selection of flavors including currently a great coconut (often hit or miss from yogurt places) and my favorite NY Cheesecake with just the right tartness. They have a decent selection of fixings (I have seen more elsewhere but nothing to complain about really. The location itself is clean and neat. \n\nAdded bonus: they have water and cups at the register unlike many other places that just have a water fountain.
0,"I'm only giving 1 star because you can't give 0 what a waste of time!!\nMy husband got a call from a guy from the jockey club saying he had won round trip tickets to anywhere we wanted and 8 show tickets to any show of our choice on the strip! LIE we went and sat through their 2 HOUR timeshare presentation which we can't afford! Got hounded by 6 different people to buy a time share when the guy over the phone said all we had to do was come pick up our \""gifts\"" he said NOTHING about a timeshare over the phone! Then when we finally got to the part of getting our \""gifts\"" we got our voucher for the plane tickets which they then proceeded to tell us all the fees we have to pay along with them! Which came out to about $400 which we don't have! Then they give us the show tickets not only did we not get to pick them\nOut but they are crappy shows we have NEVER heard of! They are a HUGE SCAM!!!"
4,"We went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. It was not too crowded and we were immediately seated. Even though it was night, the ceiling effect and temperature made it seem like a nice warm evening. We sat \""outside\"" next to the fountain, which offered a nice scenic background. It kinda gives you that Italian experience. For appetizers we ordered the crab artichoke dip and fried calamari. Both were delicious. The crab in the artichoke dip offers a very different texture and taste to that appetizer.  All the entrees looked delicious! I ordered the Chicken Scaloppine, which was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan on lemony tastes so the lemon butter and capers gave the chicken a really delightful taste for me. I really enjoyed my meal.  All my friends said their meals were good. Every entr\u00e9e that came out was a good portion for each person. The table secretly let the waiter know that it was our friend's birthday, and he came out with this huge ice cream sundae. The waiter was so nice and took a group picture from the restaurant's camera. In addition he prints it out, posted it on a little cardboard frame, and had all the waiter/waitress sign it. It was a really nice gesture. Overall, a little pricey, but its Vegas!! The food and experience was excellent."
3,"We had wanted a light lunch (the first morning after, ugh, rough..) and this was the perfect place for it. This Wolfgang Puck location sits on the second floor of City Center, kitty corner from Brunello Cucinelli for location reference. Clean modern open decor with a lot of light. Comfortable seating.\n\nWe were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She introduced us to a few menu highlights and checked on us throughout the meal. I went with the butter lettuce salad topped with delicious Gorgonzola cheese, hazelnut, bacon and egg. Decided to add some grill chicken for protein (aka, coat the stomach for more drinking. Hey when in Vegas...). It was exactly what I wanted. Light, but tasty and fulfilling. The Hazelnut added a wonderful flavor to to the dish. Also on the table were the Endive salad, Chicken Piccata and steamed clams Linguine; all very well done according to everyone. \n\nI highly recommend WP Pizzeria & Cucina for a light lunch or easy dining. Prices were very fair (compare to other established Vegas restaurants). I wouldn't say it's a culinary experience, but the food is well-done and the atmosphere and service were top notch."
2,"Stopped by to pick up a quick meal. Ordered the alluring on photo Hong Kong Chow Mein and gravely disappointed. It's mainly veggies, noodles and meat mixed together...that's it. Was I expecting too much?"
0,"This place is a joke! It's disgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at Excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. But then, to be forced to go to McDonald's and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead.... for shame. The first night they ran out of Butterfinger topping for a McFlurry. The second night, they claimed their ice cream machine was \""locked.\"" Not broken.... but locked. WTF is that?!?! If you are the only late night eatery available, you better have all your menu items available because I have a bit of a sweet tooth. This place is a joke... do yourself a favor and walk across the footbridge to New York New York and eat at America, their late night cafe."
1,"The service was really good, it was very clean but the food was not appetizing at all. I would not recommend or return there again."
4,"This place is great! Came here with some friends and had the amazing pizza, grilled octopus salad appetizer, and beet salad. The BEST octopus I have ever had!!! For dessert; ricotta with honey and pistachios, and chocolate gelato with BACON. I absolutely cannot wait to come back here. Great service, amazing food!"
0,"Well, I'd give no stars, however it won't let me.  No where on the website did it indicate a closure at 4 pm today, 12/12/12. When we arrived, an employee told us that they were closing on short notice, and then said the sign had been up for a week.\n\nAs tourists visiting from out of town, I would expect a notification on the website.  I am disappointed ( my five year old sorely so) that we were unable to do go karts with him.\n\nMy advice to the management: please post closures on your website.  There are five year olds that count on that information.  Thank you."
0,"Yikes, very disappointed. Our first visit and our last.\n\nPro's - Friendly staff, clean\n\nCon's - Salty, salty, salty. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, onion haystacks, fried    pickles were salty, salty, salty. Chicken Avocado Club  - chicken was pounded paper thin, couldn't even taste it. Only tasted the salty bun and lettuce.\n\nThe parking lot isn't big enough to accomodate the 5 restaurants it services, 6 if you count Starbucks. \n\nSo, don't waste your time. You'll get a better tasting meal at Burger King or Wendy's."
3,"house made dogs, brats, mustard\nPBR and fancy beers\nsmores for three dollars"
1,"Great vinyl selection.  Decent used CD selection.  Their new CD selection could use some work...or maybe I'm just picky because I'm a prog-rock fan and all I saw while I was there was stuff that I could pick up at Best Buy.  \n\nThe \""music\"" they were playing on the store system the day I was there was some annoying-ass avant-garde experimental crap that gave me an immediate headache.  \n\nWent in hoping to find stuff I couldn't find anywhere else...left disappointed.  The Exclusive Company has a better CD selection.  Go here only if you're looking for vinyl."
4,"I'm in love with Menchies! They have outstanding customer service. Every time I've been in they immediately greet you with a smile, show you around, offer you sample cups and top it with a friendly farewell when you walk out the door. They have daily specials (I like waffle wednesday - 20% off your order if you get a waffle cup). Lots and lots of choices!! I also really enjoy the bright, colorful decor. You just leave feeling happy :-)"
3,"This used to be my favorite place to go as a bored teen growing up on the west side. I think it's a little unfair to say that this location pales in comparison to the Tempe or Chandler locations, as they all have relatively the same merchandise and you can place an order on any of their stuff from different locations. This is probably your best bet for music if you live in glendale or peoria, its got a decent enough collections of vinyl as well. The dvd's and video game selection is better than you'd expect. Also Zia is a great place to buy concert tix.\nThey're usually pretty fair when it comes to selling your cd's or dvds or games, so all you broke teens in desperate need of pocket change come pawn your posessions cause mommy and daddy will probably just buy you a new one anyway"
1,"Menu looked promising. Ribs had good smoke ring,but were dry, not what I was hoping for. Chicken had interesting spice combo, hard yo eat. Baked beans were good. A bit pricy for the portions served. Probably would rate this place as a one & done."
1,"Got here early -- too early -- for my departing flight home.  \n\nPros:\n\n-- The Xpres Spa.  If you are going to be  too early to catch your flight, might as well do a pedi and mini massage.\n\n-- On arrival to Vegas, saw taxi line and about spit my teeth out.  Fortunately, they got this game down good.  Only took a few minutes to get a taxi to our hotel.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Really TSA? Do you have to shout and scream at everyone?  I know the TSA agents at our podunk hometown airport don't do that, they are kind and even attempt to joke.  And don't assume that everyone going through line travels often.  If you want me to move into the scanning machine and lift my arms instead of the walkthrough scanner, kindly ask me.  Don't scream at me.  Jackass.  Kiss my butt.\n\n-- Food choices appeared pathetic for an airport. \n\nI don't travel often, but I've had better airport experiences."
0,"NEVER FLY SPIRIT AIRLINES! THEY STOLE FROM ME! One star only because I can't give zero. \n   Most awful experience I have ever had flying was with these guys. First of all the only reason I booked with them is because Southwest had gone up in price for the weekend, I thought this would be cheaper, but I was wrong! \n   I arrived at check in an hour early, where the tenant there was absolutely rude! You could tell he was in a bad mood that day and because of that he would not allow me on the plane. He said I was too late. So they put me on a flight for the following day, and I thought I should check the reservation for my return flight, just to make sure I will be allowed on that plane. That's when I find out that even though my confirmation and itinerary I had printed out said that I return on 5/13, they say that I can not get on that flight because their records say I return on 5/14. \nFine. I let that go, at least I still get to spend the duration of my vacation. Only now I had to call and change all my hotel and rental car reservations, and call into work. \nSo I leave to return the next day and still have to pay for parking. Boo\n    There are hidden fees! $40 for a checked bag, and if it weighs any more than 40 lbs it's $50 more! 1 carry on allowed for $40.00.\n    That's not it. I have never been so scared of flying in my life. When landing the captain was still jerking the plane left and right, all the passengers were freaked out! Or how about the 15 second long nose dive!? Every passenger was scared sh*tless! Skies were nothing but clear, no bad weather to blame that on.\n     As if that weren't enough, when we landed and I went to get my luggage there were people all around me noticing that their luggage had been opened, and some left open. I thought mine looked closed so I headed home. Get home and realize that MY JEWELRY AND MANY OTHER ITEMS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MY LUGGAGE!!!! I am irate, call the airline and they tell me I have to go back to the airport to file a complaint. I drive all the way back to the airport and there is nobody there! Not a single employee from Spirit, nor anyone else willing to help. Call again and get the run around. I demand to speak with a manager but am just placed on hold over and over, and never get to speak with anyone that can help me.\n   I will NEVER fly with Spirit again and will do my best to keep as many others as possible from making that mistake. DO NOT FLY SPIRIT!!!"
1,"I cant say that I really enjoyed having lunch here today.  The sushi was so so.  The mushroom tempura was actually pretty tasty, everything else, not so much.\n\nI never really pay attention to the prices when I eat sushi, so I can't tell you how expensive it was.  I can tell you this - I have had better.  I think this is the first time I have had sushi that I couldnt actually taste the fish in the heavy sauces that were used.\n\nThe tea was really good, I didnt have to add sugar to it, which is not the norm for me.  I didnt have any drinks, which I should have, because I was already having a horrible day.\n\nKind of disappointing, I had been looking forward to this place since I saw them putting it in a while back.  Probably wont go back."
0,Given this place two tries and every time I ordered something different but it all tasted the same... No flavor. Cupcakes are dry and flavorless and the cookies were so hard and bland that I threw the remaining ones out. Never going here for dessert again.
2,Meh....\n\nService was SLOW... with at least half a dozen people behind the bar and only two capable of making drinks it seemed... Cocktails were nice but just. so. slow. to. be. made...\n\nBramble instead please.
1,"Greek night with friends on the westside.  I had the lamb sowlaki which was ok, I've had better.  The portions were a good size however not that tasty.  Speaking of tasty, the water tasted funny too. The fried zucchini that we had tasted like it came from the freezer. And the baklava was probably the worst I have had in Arizona.  Really soggy and the cinnamon was overwhelming.  Staff nice yet didn't seem to care to be there and working."
0,"Terrible customer service, really bad for Peter Piper. \n\nOur food took forever to arrive, and yet it wasn't all ready to be served with only half the order available. This was despite the lengthy wait and our buzzer going off to alert that our order was ready. No sufficient explanation or apology was given when the issue was brought up. The staff does not go above and beyond, or really even meet the standard expectations.\n\nSo all you're left with now is game machines for your kids, except those don't entirely work. Some had tokens jammed to render them inoperable, others simply didn't operate correctly. \n\nVery unfortunate family experience that won't be repeated."
3,"Ich mag die Schauburg !\n\n\n Ungew\u00f6hnliche und besondere Filme, es ist hier einfach nicht wie in einem gestylten neumodischen Kino, sondern wie fr\u00fcher. Nostalgisch eben.\n\n\n Es ist eine eigene kleine Welt!"
4,This place is the bomb. Fan-freaking-tactic pizza. Truly some of the best ive ever had. The owner is a really nice lady who made my pizza herself. I would recommend this to anyone. If only I lived closer I would have it more often.
3,"Contigo Peru is a Peruvian restaurant that recently opened up.  I would characterize it as a spot that is low on atmosphere but high on food.  I've never had Peruvian food before, and at the recommendation of my friend from Peru I went with the Ceviche de Pescado to get acquainted.  The food itself was great - it was prepared quickly and the presentation was great.\n\nCeviche is cooked fish that is served chilled - definitely not something I'm used to and it took some reassuring from my friend that it was safe to eat.  Once that initial shock passed, I really enjoyed it.  It was spiced with a unique hot sauce that can be added to taste.\n\nThe side dishes were two different types of corn from Peru as well - both of which added to the meal and left me satisfied.  All of this was washed down with an ice-cold Inca Cola which I had read about but never had before.\n\nThe restaurant is set up as a large, open room.  Not too much to look at, but nice and the Waitress / possibly owner / manager was really attentive and cracked a few jokes at my insistence on spicier food.\n\nAll in all I hope this place does well because it can be tough to find authentic South American food in the valley and Contigo Peru does a great job at that!"
2,"For the prices and reputation, not impressed. Our food was tasty but not amazing. Nothing was hot, as they put the food to sit and wait on a marble countertop which cools the food way more than a different surface would such as wood. Won't return."
3,We love coming here for their Baked Pork Chop and Spicy Salt. We also usually get one of the fried rice dishes with our meal. The only knock on the place is the location. Never had a bad experience and we always look forward to coming here to eat.
0,"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. Our pizza was extremely soggy, so when we asked our waiter for another, he told us we were no longer welcome. Good luck here."
3,"Great place, I love that they have a veggie bowl option.  Make sure when you order it though you specify that you want sauce on it otherwise it just comes out with veggies and rice.\n\nService is always quick and friendly and the price is great."
2,"Went to Joe's for a seafood fix. Living in Phoenix we weren't expecting it to nock our socks off therefore we weren't disappointed. The service was good. I got the shark bite drink it was good but not very strong. Three of us split two crab buckets. We had the Sam Adams with crab,clams, sausage and corn and potatoes. It was good but not anything memorable. The other bucket I didn't have much of but it featured a different kind of crab that was spicier and better flavor then the Sam Adams in my opinion. The environment is fun and the service was good."
4,"I've been feeling under the weather and was in dire need of some comfort food. I have been seeing The Main Ingredient pop up on my Android Yelp app and decided now was the time.\nI got there about 8 and decided to sit outside, I didn't want to spread my germs around inside.\n\nWe ordered the Pro-Pasto and the Mac and Cheese.\n\nThe Pro-Pasto was good...not sure why I ordered it since I'm not really a huge fan of that type of stuff but it was good anyway.\n\nNow to the greatest thing EVER!  The Mac and Cheese....it was to DIE for. This had to have been THE best Mac and Cheese I've had in my whole life and I'm not kidding.\nIt was creamy, delicious and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nYou MUST try it if you're there. It was so inexpensive too!\n\nAnother bonus is they allow dogs on the patio. Yay! Add this to another Dog Friendly place!\n\nThis is going to be my new hang out. Awesome mac and cheese, dog friendly AND down the street from my house. Winner Winner!"
2,"Stuck in North Scottsdale at 4:30 when you live on the south end of the 101 is not a good place to be.  Rather than fight traffic, we opted for an early dinner.  After driving around for entirely too long, we settled on Bamboo Club, which I had passed by several times and heard good things about, but never actually tried.  Plus, there was a $10 for $20 worth of food Yelp deal, so we went for it.  \nThe restaurant is a bit upscale, not your typical fast food chinese.  We were sat in a booth and our waitress came to take our order.  Since we were starving, we had already decided on an appetizer as well as drinks.  This seemed to confuse our waitress, along with several other things throughout the meal.  \nWe ordered the sampler and everything on it was good, but the honey chicken was amazing!  It made me wish I had ordered it for my entree.  \nWhat I did order was very good, but that honey chicken sure did stay with me.  I actually ordered the Hawaiian macadamia nut chicken, which was in a type of brown sauce with a nice caramel finish.  My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian beef, which is lightly fried and served with a side of crispy spinach.  I did really like both dishes, but I secretly wish I had stolen more bites of his.  \nThe food was good, but the service was weird.  Our waitress just seemed very strange.  She would walk all the way to our table, then look alarmed and turn in another direction.  When I tried to use the Yelp deal, she wasn't sure what to do.  It might have been the first day of the deal, but the rest of her behavior was really just....strange.  Maybe it was just an off day for her.\nThe restaurant was good, but I'd say I'll probably just go back for happy hour and that sampler platter, rather than a full on meal.  It was a bit on the pricey side even with the deal (not surprising as we were in North Scottsdale), but I'm not entirely sure it was worth it."
2,"Janky ass little place for some good n greasy snacks. I came with some old and new Yelper friends for dessert. \n\nI like deep fried oreos best and you get 3 (more than enough for me) for 99cents. They were just freshly made so they were delicious and warm. They're not too sweet when they're fried up in batter and they turn soft. Sometimes it sucks when it's not busy then they might give you a batch that has been sitting there. Boooo. If there's no one there, ask if the batch is cold already. I come back when there's a line.\n\nThey have standing tables so you can chomp down, but they really need someone to clean those tables. Ours had ketchup, chocolate and nuts on it and collected more nuts and powdered sugar after we were done. These are messy type foods being eaten by a good number of drunks so they need to be a bit more diligent with the tables. \n\nYou can't beat the price for a snack so it can't hurt to stop by, but it's been hit/miss."
2,"When I was told we were going to Fry's, I thought we were going shopping for electronics (http://www.frys.com/).  So I was surprised when we ended up at a grocery store.  We were there specifically to get wine for our hosts for the weekend.  I was impressed with their selection and prices - very similar to what I am accustomed to.  I ended up finding a very reasonable Sauvignon Blanc that I will be stocking up back home for a daily drinking wine."
1,"I don't know where to start about this place. Friggin \""Jonny\"" needs to be around more. I know this much, after Kim got off the phone with me, I felt that she was trying to blow me off to get back to customers. I could name some more cons about that place but it would be like trying to beat a dead horse. When it comes to prices, stay away from this place like the plague. I'm dead serious."
2,"I decided to come here after driving past it so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull menu, no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I ordered a tripa and an al pastor. I was the only one there, and it took them a good five minutes to prepare them. Not only that, they messed up my order, they gave me a cabeza instead of tripa. Very disappointed. \n\nIf I ever come back I'll know what to expect."
4,"Wow.  I was so impressed with this place!  Came here for a date night and it delivered.  The atmosphere was romantic and the service impeccable.  Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn't end up buying a drink I wouldn't have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I've been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn't nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you'd dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I'm not going to lie, I don't get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I'm pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, \""This is the best burger I've ever had\"".  I have seen how many burgers this man has eaten, and trust me, that is high praise.  Service - five stars!  Food - five stars!  Drinks - Five again.  Would come back here happily."
3,"Very friendly service, nice atmosphere and free wifi.  Coffee is good, not superb."
4,"Loved the food, atmosphere, and service. I would definitely go back!"
1,"I generally like Cocomero. It's pretty tasty and there are tons of options. However, I attempted to go tonight and found that Cocomero was closed, even though the hours on Yelp say 11:30am-11:00pm. Definitely disappointed that the hours listed are wrong."
0,"It was a 5 hour wait to get in. Once we had paid, it was still 30 minutes to be seated. Service was OK, but not great. It was way over priced. Some items were good, but most were sub par. I paid over $50 a person, and most everything was disappointing. The crab legs were flavorless, the crayfish weren't very good either. Of the 60+ items I tried, I found two that were outstanding(the tacos, and the lamb), and for the price/wait, everything should have been. \n\nSave yourself the hassle, either go to an actual restaurant, of a $30 buffet, and you'll get as good or better quality, without the wait."
4,"We do not understand why Lago has such negative reviews - it is our favorite buffet, and we have done several.  Sure, it does not have as much variety as other casinos such as Planet Hollywood or Paris... the quality, however, is much better.  The meats are cooked better than most buffets, and the fresh fruit is usually much better.  We love their sugar-free desert options. Every time we go to Vegas, we look forward to eating at Lago."
0,"Where to start....huhhhhhh..................I had to take our dog here based on the rescue stating so.  Immediately ran into disorganization. Secondly, they will hand write visa/mc numbers for other vendors (cremation) which is not stored securely/nor is that to be done in such a fashion. I did discuss that with them, and got the SHRUG...I also explained they can be fined 250,000.00 per occurrence.... SHRUGGGG. OK.  Not a good sign.  Each time I went in here, myself and all the other clients were seated outside rooms while they took the animals back, without owners, VERY ODD. No owners went into the rooms, any of the 6-7 times I was there.  When this dog had worms (when she first arrived) they handed her to me and said here you go, give her this once a day for 2 weeks. OK. I get home and it says give 1 dose...period. so i had to call them next day..and she said no it is 1 dose. OK.  \nProblem number 2....i got 4 puppies who were seen by this vet clinic, after an ok, they were brought to me. I knew immediately they were all sick with something..not good...as they had horrible diarrhea and it smelled horrible, throughout the house. So after NUMEROUS calls, and so much wrong information, I had 2 puppies go back, after call number (3-4-5) one of the girls answering the phone messed up and said, the one puppy had giardia...(WHAT) and the second dog tested positive (WHAT) now i still have 2 puppies...(they are neg...so i was told)......so another  2 weeks  go by, i call oh no (the 3rd one was positive..the whole time) (WHAT) so i speak with others and have them relocated to a different vet. Surprisingly that vet treated them ONE time and they were then negative...that was 6 dogs total who had been through multiple rounds of meds at West Charleston Animal place, to no avail.  I felt like they were onesie twosie ing the rescue, yeah they may get a better price, but if you need to keep doing it again and again and again, with boarding....sounds like a money maker to me! I was so mad, because I have other dogs and they could have gotten very sick from this disorganization! Not to mention 2 weeks of shoveling smelly water poop! DISGUSTING!!!  I did not trust them to spay the rescue puppy i had.,...I have never in all my years of having animals...ever experience such a disorganized HOT MESS!!"
1,"Average slices. Nothing special.\n\nNot sure how much they pay the New Times for being nominated as PHX's best slice, but I disagree.\n\nI will say the prices are good and the girl who works the counter is always nice. \n\nWay better options out there, but if you are in a hurry and live close to this location..."
1,"The Flamingo Hotel...hmm...its a hotel? I rate it 3 stars because it does what it is supposed to do...gives me somewhere to sleep. I also really like the casino here...I say here, because I am writing this review in my room, while paying 13 dollars for 24 hours worth of internet. That is not so bad, but I just think its stupid that hotel don't offer free wi-fi, they just want money so whatever. Anyways. \n\nI am here with my boyfriend and my grandparents. We have a Go room and my grandparents have a deluxe. First things first, we went to check-in with no wait because it was around 530 pm. The lines are very long earlier in the day. They give us our keys and we walk with my granparents to their room. They slide there key in the door and it opens....dot dot dot...to people in the room. Yes, they gave my grandparents a room that was already booked!! (LOCK YOUR DOORS WITH THE EXTRA LOCK) Thankfully they were just sitting on the bed, but imagine? So I was pissed. I let my grandpa go down and deal with it because I didn't want to start yelling, hah. Anyways, don't you think they should have gotten an upgrade? Nope, they actually got the exact same room but higher? I guess that is an upgrade...the desk girl said they were getting a better room. It was not better at all. So its good to know that they don't take care of their mistakes...you know what I am going to take away a star...now I'm mad again. 2 stars... \n\nOkay, our Go room is a really nice room. I was kind of pissed though because I had requested a room with a King bed and a separate tub/shower. It is why we got the room, but they didn't have one. So we just have the stand up shower. ehh. Oh Yea, the air has been on the entire time but the temp still says 75 in here. Apparantly it goes off when you leave the room, so it pretty much only works when your in the room...Oh yeah, only one of our keys worked, so we had to go down to fix that. They also didn't clean our room the after the first night. I don't think they even walked in. So we had to call for clean towels. Then the next day we came in around 2 pm. they hadn't cleaned so we called just to make sure. 10 minutes later they were here to clean...\n\nI just highly recommend paying for a nicer hotel. The food selection sucks. Honestly the only thing that is good is the bed. It is pretty comfortable. They Casino good. There aren't any good bars...\n\nI mean if you just want a basic hotel, in the middle of the strip, it is a good hotel. Just don't expect anything extra. Expect to want to leave the hotel everyday, because there is nothing to do here...\n\nhope this review helps!! \n:) nykki"
4,Everyone has a love at Earl's mine is tuna melt. Go find yours..
1,"Is this what a krispy kreme doughnut is suppose to taste like?  I sure hope not.... \n\nWe bought 3 kinds, the regular glazed kind, and jelly filled with apples and cinnamon and jelly filled with strawberries. I did not like any of them... they didn't even taste fresh.\n\nI would not get doughnuts from here ever again. \n\nPerhaps I could be persuaded to try them from another location, but one more chance is all I'll give."
4,"Five stars for the food and five stars for the experience. Definitely a dive/hole in the wall - but one you should definitely make a point to stop at and grab some burgers.\n\nOur options were limited on this late Saturday night. It was around 9pm and we didn't feel like going to dinner nor did we feel like making dinner. So Yelp jumped in and was like \""what up? I got a dive for you to try\"" and I was like, \""sweet.\"" So after checking out the limited reviews for Burger Brothers I decided to head over and check it out. Burger Bro's is connected to a 76 gas station and has really limited space. It's just walking distance from the luxurious Emerald Suites, and by luxurious I mean anything but that. But location is secondary when you're seeking out good food.\n\nI ordered a cheeseburger with advocado and my wife had a cheeseburger with bacon. She said the bacon was cooked to perfection and really complimented the burger. The avocado on my burger was perfect. The cook on the  burger was exactly right with just a little pink - the buns were amazing, slightly toasted on the grill. I don't like fries and I loved the fries here. One order is enough for two, maybe even three people. Fresh cut, comparable to Five Guys but better. \n\nI had a chance to chat with one of the brothers and enjoyed hearing about the business which has only been open for 4 months. The order took about 15 minutes to come up since everything is made fresh and there were a few in front of me. Because of the wait he gave me a complimentary beverage - not necessary but very much appreciated. Great to see a little hole in the wall with great food right around the corner from my house. Wishing Burger Brothers all the best and looking forward to my next visit to try the chicken strips and onion rings."
2,"After hiking at Mount Charleston, four of us stopped here to try their lunch buffet.  One of our group has been here before and recommended it.  It was a good recommendation!\n\nThe buffet is small but is in the size range of others.  At $11.99, it's price is OK.  Not the cheapest, not the most expensive.  The restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating.  There is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located.  The buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining room.\n\nThere was a selection of salad, yogurt, chutney, and desserts at the beginning of the buffet.  After the initial bar, there were several chafing dishes with various foods.  I tried the chicken tikka masala, a curry chicken, dal makhani, onion pakora, and some fried chicken balls--the name of which I can't remember.  Accompanying this was basmati rice.  \n\nFor the most part, the dishes were good and flavorful.  The dal was bland.  It could have used some seasoning.  The chicken balls were tasty and different.  I should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but I failed to do so.  Next time.  One of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry.  I didn't try this but noted this for future reference.  I made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition.  I got one gulab jamun and it was very good.  It was quite soft, and it was not overly sweet.  A very nice ending to lunch.\n\nService was average.  We were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room.  When I went to get my gulab, my dirty plate was not removed.  Other than this, things went OK.\n\nIf I'm in the area, I'd certainly stop again.  It is in the middle tier of Indian buffets I've tried.  Since it's the closest place to where I live, I'll be back.  I wouldn't recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the UNLV area."
0,Horrible! If you plan on booking here I would advise to look somewhere different. Customer service is ridiculous. I stayed there the night of my wedding and they told us to come back on our one year and stay on them. Came back and they had said they have no record of us staying or they would comp us. Lucy front desk supervisor said she will do the research and if we did stay she will take care of everything. She was supposed to call me back the next day but never did. I called back a few days later talking to Sarah the other supervisor. She said they found our reservation but will not comp us because we had no voucher. She never even asked me if I had a voucher. So I went to book elsewhere and decided to call back to file a complain on customer service and empty promises. When I called back for Sarah she was busy talking to the manager. I asked to have the manager call me back to file a complaint. Sarah called me back and said the manager Carla was not in that day she can call me back Monday. When I called her out saying the front desk person said she was there all she had to say was she just left. This place is cheap dishonest and has horrible customer service. Don't ever stay here. Only reason I put one star is because I had to with yelp
4,"I've been to many burger places and eaten a variety of burgers... and I must say their Kalbi Burger is hands down the BEST burger I have ever had in my life!!!!!! My sister lives in Vegas so every time I come to visit, I make her take me to Bachi for that Kalbi Burger. The flavor and quality of the meat is just outstanding. The pickles that come with it is a perfect addition to the burger. And, Bachi also makes their own soda and it is so yummy and refreshing! \n\nTheir oxtail chili cheese fries are also to die for. I really wish Bachi would come to San Jose-- we need an Asiani fusion burger place down here!\n\nThis should definitely be on your list if you are going to Vegas!!!!"
4,Just stopped in to get a juice before I tackle Walmart. I have a miserable cold/upper respiratory infection and sound half dead. Lol. I ordered the citrus kick and the girl who helped me suggested i add the c and zinc to help me feel better. She was so sweet I had to post a complimemt.
1,"Perhaps I have overstayed my welcome. Lately the sides have been awful. Last night I ordered hash brown casserole, pinto beans and okra. The okra and casserole were cold. I asked my server if I could get some fresh hash brown casserole because it was cold and crunchy. He said that was fine and he brought me more casserole that was so very obviously microwaved. It was the same casserole but now was steaming hot and tasteless. Obvious signs of microwaved reheating. That in my opinion is really poor customer service. \n\nOther visits I have had reheated green beans (dark green and mushy), cold okra, dried pinto beans and cold corn. It's hit or miss and I am getting tired of it. And to top it off the servers act like it's such a pain to take it back. \n\nThe country store is still as good as it ever was and the people that work there are very friendly."
4,"We worked with Aaron for our mortgage and could not be happier with the results. The sub 5% rate with no points is amazing but the service was even better. I especially liked the step by step checklist keeping us informed of where we were in the process, the specific actions we had to take, when we had to take them and what to expect next. The personal interaction was professional, the documents were always on time and information was always accurate."
1,"OVER-RATED, OVER-PRICED, OVER-IT!\n\nBest part about this restaurant are the friendly stray cats that hang out around the patio begging for scraps of food.  \n\nThe food was decent but not worth the price.  Any foody could come up with the dishes and anyone overly impressed obviously isn't adventurous enough with their foods.\n\nIt's pretty but so is my backyard.\n\nAll in all, meh."
2,I made reservations on cinco de mayo and was surprised the could even accommodate a party of 5. Although there was a wait outside we were seated immediately. The service was extremely slow and inattentive. The food and just meh...I also got the sweet potato enchiladas and really didnt think they were anything special. I would give it one more chance to see if anything is work going back for. For now i just want to move on to the next review and not wast my time with this mediocre resturant.
3,"Chipotle is a concept restaurant, so no its not going to be \""authentic mexican\"" nor will it be authentic mexican portions prices and sizes. Try to remember what state you're in....\n\nBut I love them for other reasons, like their attempts to use more humanely raised beef, pork and chicken. \n\nAlso the Chipotle in Midvale, UT used to donate food to the treatment center I worked at for women and children. So two days a week I got to eat it for lunch, and one time they messed up catering order. I was asked to pick up 40 free burritoes, hell yess I would, damn that was one heavy box but I got to take home 8 free burritoes! \n\nAnyway back to the basics, the beef is the closest thing to Carne Esada you will find in this town, the Carnitas are pretty good. Chicken is not my fav, ask for veggies on your burrito, and add Guac its worth it. \n\nI like that they have a variety of salsas to choose from, mild, med hot, and stock extra hot sauce. I just wish it was Cholula hot sauce but oh well. \n\nSomeone said this location was dirty and gross, I didn't find it to be. I think Guac could be a little cheaper, seeing as how i can make it for half that price but that is my only gripe. Love these guys!"
3,"My wife and I went to this restaurant just a few days ago.  We were very pleased at the service, the food, and the price.  I have really been surprised at some of the reviews for this restaurant on Yelp, as our experience seems to have been better than some others have had.  I got cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans, and it was delicious!  The chips were fresh and the salsa was not bad.  The menu is packed full of New Mexico style mexican food, so you should expect that.  I am new to Arizona, and this will be a place I definitely want to go back to.  I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here, but we were more than satisfied with the food, and the staff was very nice and prompt.  We give it four stars and recommend you give it a try.  (And stay away from El Palacio, in Chandler, as we ate there tonight and it was horrible.  I have another review for that place)."
4,I didn't know it was possible to be in heaven at an airport. Especially considering the freezing rain and snow is delaying everything. \n\nThe chicken is delicious. The biscuits are delicious. Nothing else to really day because that's all you need. Lifted my spirits and filled me up. I'm actually sad my flight is boarding because I couldn't finish it all.
2,"This is not what I was expecting from what I been hearing about this place. This is a fast food type p[lace that sells healthier stuff. The food was just okay, the place was a little dirty not bad. not much seating inside and the soda fountain was located outside. This is more of a trendy place more then a restaurant. If you go here don't expect much and you will be satisfied."
2,Fun place for older kids. 9 and up. I didn't feel comfortable having my 3 years old there.
0,"The Riviera has really gone down hill. From the air conditioning that shakes the whole building, making it feel like an earthquake may be ocurring, to the $4 cup of Pepsi filled with ice that, when it gets accidentally spilled by a sober person, is not replaced, this place utterly lacks class, style and customer service. It is clear (and it has been verbally expressed to us) that the employees don't even like working here. The Riviera is a huge rip off - don't come here! The casino needs to be ripped down - good riddens...."
3,"An excellent little place to have a picnic lunch!  Prices are a bit high, but the atmosphere and use of local products for the food is great!  We will be back."
3,"We had the pastrami burger ,lots of juicy tender pastrami and if that was not enough a burger to boot.  We always enjoy our meals here. ."
0,"I used to think this place was amazing till I tried Nordstroms in the bay area. Customer service here is very judgmental. I was actually asked if I was just looking or was actually going to buy something. I walked right out. I wanted to return something once and was told I did not have a receipt, never had that problem anywhere else. \n\nYou will get great customer service if you dress like a Scottsdale snob flashing your money worse than Rodeo Drive. Otherwise, expect to be shunned. They take advantage since they are the only Nordstroms in Arizona and Scottsdale is just a wanna be Rodeo Drive with not as much money or class, and worse plastic surgery."
1,"Although, I love my Starbucks a few times a week and this particular location is the closest to my house... I will drive further just to avoid going here. Unfortunately, I have had too many unpleasant experiences at this location. The crew seems to be ever changing (not sure if this is due to the fact that this location is deemed a training facility or not), more often than not they get my order wrong, & and one time I swear I was served a drink made with sour soy milk. (I of course asked the Barista to remake it--which I don't like to have to do, but the first one tasted so bad it churned my stomach for the entire day)\nFurthermore, I find this all very unfortunate considering the fact that this location is very spacious and has a great amount of seats & plug-ins to hang out and use the free Wi-fi. However, the last few visits I opted out of coffee & only ordered tea to try to enjoy the atmosphere--big mistake! I usually enjoy the hustle and bustle of a coffee shop, even find it to be soothing, but not here. Way too noisy! \nOverall, I guess I find that there are differences from location to location even if the menus are the same. For me the people make it or break it, and there's just not enough consistency at this location. -B"

3,"Party atmosphere and sports bar with a dozen tv's, throw in a massive selection of wing flavors and you have Wild Wings Cafe.\n\nI was there with a few friends for St. Patty's Day (night?) and we took up a table for a few hours. The staff was attentive, even if they did manage to mess up the separate checks a little. With $2.75 Killians on special and $1.50 green beer, getting charged for an extra one wasn't a problem. The mixed drinks were mixed pretty strong. Our waiter did manage to split the appetizers for each of us, which was cool.\n\nWings. The house special. They -only- have 33 different flavors, from the bbq to the virgin all the way up to Braveheart. When they say hot, they mean hot. Mix and match, Tuesday is buy 1 get 1 free night. The Chicken Queso dip and the Hot Shots (deep fried sausage & cheese pastry) was great to share."
1,"Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable."
3,"We came here on a Monday afternoon to order off their lunch special. We got \n1. Grilled chicken sandwich\n2. Shrimp tacos\n3. Strawberry lemonade\nfor $23\n\n- Lunch Specials: M-F 11-3pm. $7.99. Great deal!\n- Fresh bread\n- After 3pm, they have their 'Take 5' Deal. 5 for $5 from 3-6pm\n- If you come at 230, you can receive the best of both worlds!\n- Great chicken sandwich. Tasty\n- 4-5 pieces of either fried or grilled shrimp. Flavorful. Tortilla and rice were a bit hard. \n- Flavorful drink. No refills.\n- Great service. Bryan was friendly and attentive. \n- Better alternative for an American lunch compared to Red Robin during 11-3. Otherwise, I prefer RR simply bc bottomless fries and flavored drinks."
1,"This Target has gone down hill since their grand opening 4 or 5 years ago. The staff are rude and have attitudes partly because management does not hold accountable to higher standards. Hoodrats pass though the parking lot and harass for money or ask what you be about? (gangs) Managers refuse to have security patrol outside and told me their security is only to protect the customers and merchandise inside the store. The area is ghetto, but Wally's immediately 2 blocks to the east manages to have nicer staff and a safer parking lot with about 10 plain clothes and uniformed officers handling the parking and inside the store."
0,Scorpionssssssssssss! Scorpions all over our apartment!  I have a baby and we have to move out only after a month of living in this shithole!  I have to pay 2 months rent and a break lease fee of the same amount to keep my baby safe.  The management could care less and of course didn't mention their scorpion problem when they showed us the property!  Don't move here!\n\nI just found out that Talus Ranch signed for a package of mine delivered by UPS and Talus Ranch lost it!  I brought in proof from UPS and the complex is saying even though they signed for it thy aren't responsible!  I can't believe how horrible this place is.  I would NEVER recommend this apartment!
0,If you want to be rushed and make an appointment only to wait an hour past the time then go to jcpennys. I can see why they are on the verge of closing the doors. We get taken in a room finally for our portraits only to be asked to wait because the family before us didn't hear their name\nCalled. So we go out to see a mother acting like a child because we were called before her. I am sorry that god gave you a big nose and small ears.
1,The food is nothing to brag about. I left here and immediately felt sick to my stomach. I went here with a group of people. No one really loved their meal. There was something on my burger and I couldn't tell you what it was. I think it was burnt cheese but I am not sure. The decorations are good service was OK food not so great.
2,Loved this place!  Great memories of getting Ramen in Japan.  Prices reasonable.  Great fun and great meal with the family.
1,Burgers are just OK. Ice cream was very good but I'm not sure that all their ingredients are very fresh? Some pieces tasted a bit off. Probably won't come back here again.
1,"We were there for lunch on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, and seated ourselves on the patio.  Unfortunately, there was one waitress serving about a half dozen tables  on the patio while tending the bar, so service was slow throughout our visit.  The salsa was a notch above taco sauce from a bottle, not a good start.  One of my favorite dishes is carne adovada, with it's rich, smoky, sometimes spicy flavor, so I went with the carne adovada plate.  Wow, was this one a disappointment!   The meat, usually moist and fall off the bone tender,  was dry and chewy.  The sauce was primarily tomato based, and lacked the kind of flavor that you find at Los Dos Molinos or Carlsbad Tavern.  And it was over salted.  The accompanying beans and rice were forgettable, the 2 sopapillas that came with the meal were OK.  For what it's worth, though, the table of visitors from Wisconsin next to ours seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Hasta la vista, Frank and Lupe."
4,"Sin City Snoballs and Snacks deserve all of the Yelp love in the world and I'm going to be the man for the job. As the unofficial marketing rep for SCS&S(wow that's a mouthful) I'll fill you in on why this food truck is here to stay. At first I was greeted with warm smiles and an explanation of everything offered on the truck. I was then given a sample of their warm apple cider, Belgian hot chocolate, and a donut. This Jew was head over heels at this point because free food is the way directly to my heart.\n\nAfter experiencing just a taste of what this truck had to offer I had to splurge for the Maple and Bacon glazed donuts. That's right, you heard correctly, MAPLE AND BACON. The donuts themselves were perfectly fried and crisp yet deliciously moist inside. They use real maple syrup and crispy bacon for a combination that is sure to make you the life of any party you show up to. I passed some off to fellow Yelpers and they seem officially hooked. \n\nI ended off my experience with a full hot apple cider with a scoop of ice cream on the bottom and on a cold night this can only be described as blissful. The combination makes it feel like you are drinking grandma's apple pie(unless of course your grandma can't bake). \n\nIf you are looking for something sweet and filling, or you just want to be warmed up on a cold Las Vegas night, look no further than Sin City Snoballs & Snacks. Don't forget to tell them Jonathan S. sent you. Oh wait, I'm just the unofficial marketing rep. Damnit!"
3,"If you're interested in trying Vietnamese sandwiches. This franchise is tops. The bread is made in-house. It's unfortunate that they don't have Lee's Sandwiches all across the United States. The sandwiches are made to order, so it takes a minute. It is well worth the wait. Must try their durian smoothie! It's authentic. CASH ONLY.\n\nUPDATE: They lose one star because they close whenever they want. While that's like a boss and all, please don't post a closing time and close 15 minutes before. If you are worried about having customers after closing time, CHANGE YOUR CLOSING TIME!"
0,"I'm not one for bad or fast food 98% of the time. However, late night, after busting my ass at work, I sometimes get a bit hungry and don't feel like eating subway or tropical smoothie as they're usually the healthiest \""fast\"" options on the way home at that time of night....So, I hit up Carl's Jr. Which, I typically like whenever I DO decide to eat like crap. lol \n\nThis location, I have visited 3 times, each time late at night after 10pm. Each time, they forget to give me fries, or they're soggy and old....the sandwich is not even what I ordered or it's slapped together and missing some of what should be there.. Gave me the wrong drink or it would be flat. Each time, one of these things happened...Well, 3 strikes you're definitely out. Maybe it's the late night crew that needs fixing, who knows. But, I highly recommend, if you are going to this location....to go during the day. Best of luck with a better experience."
1,"I wasn't impressed with La Paz. Like others have said, I wanted to like it. I really wanted another Mexican restaurant to frequent. But the food (I had the steak burrito) was just kinda so-so. \n\nI have to say...the worst part of my experience was that the hostess sat my friend and I next to a table of about 10 babies and toddlers. Yes, there parents were there, though you wouldn't have known that because the kids were destroying the restaurant and screaming and going crazy. I know this isn't La Paz's fault, but it was pretty ridiculous that they sat us in this terrible spot. The rest of the restaurant was pretty wide open. Not cool."
4,"A year and a half later, and Jessica is still the haircut girl of my dreams. There have been a couple of occasions where I've had to get cut by other girls at Sport Clips, and even cuts at places other than SportClips.

1,"Expensive room (Octavius Tower),  Filthy Bathroom, Broken wireless, Overpriced and medicore restaurants\n==================================\nI go to vegas 4 times a year and stay at Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn or MGM. This was the first time i was at Caeser's Palace. \n\nThe in-room wireless for which you pay $15/day doesn't work. You are left without the internet. \n\nThe jacuzzi, that they claimed was best thing, was FILTHY! I could see ugly green/brown stains all over with hair and what looked like fecal matter. YUCK! \n\nWhen I complained, the staff insisted that I should give them notice. How much notice do you need for a clean room for one of your most expensive towers? \n\nI am sure this was a great hotel 20 years ago when it was first built. Now it is showing its age and attitude of staff says that they are not getting paid enough to be there."
0,"I just left Teakwoods in Gilbert wishing I went somewhere else. I happened to stop by there to eat for the first time. The service was VERY slow . They left us unattended for quite a while.  Our drinks finally arrived after waiting a long time. When the food finally came out, the sides were ice cold. The management there was less than interested in fixing any problems we had. The server told me 3x the manager would come speak to us anr never showed up. The food was horrible, the service was the pits and management was far from effective.  Save you time money and appetite and find a different place to eat."
3,"Good spot. Wish it was cuter & more home-y/warm inside. But the coffee and food BOTH deliver, so it's worth it. Although I would do a major overhaul on the signage outside and the interior. Make it look more inviting.\n\nVegan muffin was great! Moist & rich with blueberry deliciousness. Had a breakfast wrap with extra spinach and was quite satisfied. Great coffee too... YAY ALMOND MILK! \n\nOverall YAY! But really---- she's clean, but if you want people to hang out for a bit... make it a bit more cozy."
1,"This Thai place was a recommendation from my nail artist.  \n\nIt is clean and the service was quick and polite. \n\nOrdered pad Thai - terrible ; very oily, and lack flavor; green curry - very watered down and lacked Thai flavor; and some appetitiAers that were bland. \n\nIf you are hungry only."
0,"1: they only do housekeeping every 4th day.  When I called the front desk, they told me that housekeeping would not be coming to my room during my stay unless I paid extra.\n\n2:  while eating breakfast outside at the clubhouse/restaurant, the sprinklers came in and sprayed me and my group's table.  The waiter was nonplussed.  When we asked him about it he stated that he did not know when they come on or if there's a way to not have them spray the tables.  Thanks for the heads up.\n\n3:  aside from the golf course, there is nothing to do here.  The \""resort\"" is stranded and there's no shuttle service.  \n\n4:  on the last day (a few hours before check out) housekeeping DID stop by.  What were they trying to accomplish?  Wake us up, clean our room, wait 3 hours, then clean it again??\n\n5: they'll try to sell you a timeshare ... So frustrating.\n\n6: the Internet connection is sparse at best and there's little cell phone reception out here.\n\nThere's more, but those are the big ones.  We paid a lot of money for a hotel room that doesn't get cleaned.  Do not go here."

1,"It's really pretty inside, but the service and food were just okay.\n\nThe portions were tiny and it wasn't anything special, and it was expensive!  I suppose you pay more because it's kinda fancy inside, but still..\n\nI ordered a bento box & there was barely any teriyaki chicken!  And it came with ONE gyoza & ONE egg roll.  My friends ordered sushi, and they didn't get their food until at least 15 minutes after I did.  They were kind and took one dish off the bill because of our long wait, but overall it wasn't the greatest dining experience.  My friends said the sushi was okay, but they've had better, and so have I."
4,So glad I found this brewery in AZ while visiting family!!! Just absolutely loved the beer! Loved the atmosphere! Loved the food!! Great place you will not be disappointed!!
2,"Lunch crowd was very busy but the bar has open tables and booths. Nice menu selection and good weekday deals. I had lunch special half California chicken sandwich, soup, and fries for $7.99. Tuesdays is half off all wine by the glass and bottle so I also took advantage of that! Nothing really special but over all good service, good atmosphere and make sure to take a look at their daily specials."
3,"The food was great, the loco moco was very filling and the gravy was tasty and complimented the dish well, thick burger patty! Once you walk into this restaurant, you immediately get a good vibe feeling that the food is going to be good. The drive from the airport or downtown may seem long, but It's located just before it seems like its off the beaten path...bring your gps"
1,"This place is generally terrible. \n\nOvercrowded, understaffed. The self check out lanes shut down early. The grocery store is organized in the most counter intuitive way possible. There are always pan handlers asking for money standing or sitting directly outside of the doors. The produce is usually terrible. \n\nI gave Giant Eagle an extra star for convenience. This location is close to my house and it has it's own parking lot. They're open late and I'm a lazy shopper so that fits my schedule. But if you go late they are super understaffed and the self check out is closed so you will probably have to wait anyway."
3,"Went here for a first date - It's got a lot of cool games, air hockey, arcade games, on multiple levels... felt like a little kid spending my allowance.. only this time I had a super smokin hot girl with me... so best of both worlds!\n\nOutside they have a variety of really cool rides, a better than your average carnival and a mini golf course which looks really cool at night all lit up -- it's fairly affordable, depending on what you are wanting to do... \n\nThe place is pretty clean compared to what I expected, as it was my first time here... I'm definitely planning to go back, hopefully with the same girl ;)"
1,"it was just okay and pricey, to me nothing specail"
2,"I tagged along with my husband on his quest to buy ammunition (not as charming as it sounds) to this place when they were having their hugely hyped tent sale. I'm a curious sort, so I wandered out to the tent. Yikes, what a waste of canvas and my time. If those are clearance prices then I'm Queen of the Nile. \n\nThe employee who helped with the ammunition (inside, that stuff does not go on sale) was courteous, and we didn't have to wait very long for him (it's one of those 'press the button and wait' deals). In fact, he soft of jogged over, which I appreciated. \n\nI don't love the set-up at the registers. You stand on the side by the counter until it's time to swipe your credit card and sign the screen, then you walk around to the front of the register. It's not painful or anything, but it feels very awkward, and the young man working the register was not especially charming (but better than the person at the register the last time I was there, she was a unhappy camper). I don't need people to befriend me, but I like it when they aren't actively bored and/or wishing for death."
4,We would be lost without Lucky Me Pet Care. Michelle is our Dogsitter. She comes every time we need her so Oliver knows her and loves her. She cares about him and treats him as if he were her own dog. Lucky me is exactly what we are bc of Lucky Me Pet Care!!
3,"Although I am not a vegetarian, I stopped by for lunch anyways. The veggie places I've ate at up to this point have been ok at best but veggie delight seems to outshine them all. \n\nThey serve standard Asian noodle and rice dishes as well as sandwiches and rolls. I tried the spring roll, and avocado and crispy chicken sandwich. The roll had faux beef and the sandwich had faux chicken of course. While I was able to detect that they were not actually meat, it was pretty tasty anyways. The sandwich and rolls were actually above average for the Asian places I've been to.\n\nAnother point is that I spent about twelve on myself which is not bad compared to other veggie places. They are cash only, so come prepared."
4,"My friends and I were very impressed with this sandwich shop. This is the best viet sub we've experienced better than any here in Toronto. Sandwiches were well made, fast, and didn't cost too much.\n\nEven though it was basement level the place was professional and well designed. They offer diverse set of drinks and snacks. This place is so professional and well organized that it makes you think it's a chain. Kudos to the owners for creating such a good experience."
1,"I dig cafes and had a BOGO so decided to check this place out on my lunch hour. The food was decent, but then I was sick for two days after. I won't return!"
4,"First time Spring Trainer. Nice scenary but the stadium is a little outdated.\n\nThe secret is out... If you want to snag some BP baseballs stand behind the right field wall facing the street. Everybody stands behind the left field wall in the parking lot. You'll have no competition and plus all the balls that make it over the fence go over the right field wall. I think I got 8 or 9.\n\nGo 2014 Angels, season of redemption."
4,"I hit this place back at the end of March and holy shmoly, were we spoiled!  I jokingly bitched to my cousin Andrew what a shortcoming of theirs that sometimes I had to exert myself by pouring my wine (The wait staff were persistently adding wine to our glasses and perhaps, two or three times (sigh), I had to do it myself.)  Not to mention that the wait staff would immediately fold up any napkins off-handedly left at the table when someone would go to the bathroom.  Of course, I jokingly complained to Andrew how they would only fold the napkins on the outside of our booth (where they could easily reach them) and not fold the napkins left on the inside our booth, where they couldn't see them.  ha ha, how fastidious I can be.  \n\nOh yeah, and the food was super-fabulous.  Our party of four got the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  We savored our food and wine so much that it became an epic, 3-hour affair.  Not once did the staff make any comments or innuendos that the table was needed for another party or that we should get going or anything like that.  Then they happily obliged and wrapped up our leftovers, so we could enjoy our great meal twice, later, as it happened, after a night of drinking."
3,"The Habit is a good change from normal burger joints. It's like a classy, \""Carl's Jr.\"" Their menu is OK and the service was decent. The parking during lunch time is tough so get there early."
2,"This was deleted the first time I posted it due to it not falling within Yelp guidelines, I am reposting it to comply with them.

They were out of many of the doughnuts, and I felt the entire experience lacked customer service.\n\n\nLet's start from the beginning: first time I went to pink box was at the location on Lake Mead, and they were out of almost all the doughnuts. I thought I would give them another try and try the location in town square, and they were completely sold out of doughnuts at about\u00a07pm. I try it for the third time, I go back to the location on Lake Mead, and they actually have doughnuts in stock. The doughnuts were the best that Las Vegas has to offer, but not as good as Portland, California, or Seattle. I then find out they have a new location in Henderson, NV, I am now excited because I live in Henderson. I go there at\u00a07pm\u00a0on a Tuesday. They are closed, the sign says June hours 6-3:30ish, first off it is July, second I thought we lived in a 24 hour town. As I am standing there three other people pull up and ask if they are open, I respond with a NO. I emailed them regarding the other two problems I had months ago and received no email or call back. This is poor customer service. The fact that a doughnut shop isn't open till at least 9 is ridiculous. Krispy Kreme, Winchells, and others are open late. Pinkbox owners if you read this please take note, social media, and word of mouth will destroy your business much more than anything else. Good luck in the future as you will need it."
0,"Oooooh...I picked up a small chicken salad for lunch the other day and took a bite in the car.  Totally rancid!  I took it back in and the owner said \""Give her something else, no charge\""  The next thing I ordered was a turkey wrap, which the staff member pulled out of the same under refrigerated container.  The health department should take a look before someone gets sick.\nI called the owner and he said he would \""look into it\""\nAlso, way too expensive for what you get"
4,"the most BEAUTIFUL hotel on the strip. DE-LUXE!!!! We had a FUN gondola ride through the Venice canals inside the hotel. Our Gondolier was Luciano... he had a beautiful voice, and a FAB italian accent... super fun! And it was only $12.50 a piece. The husband and I are DYING to go to Italy... so this will hold us over for now..."
0,"If you want a woman hating, narcissistic and sexually inappropriate doctor. then Dr. Howard Mason is your best choice. I have awful insurance so I am often referred to awful doctors. Dr. Howard Mason was one of them. He is a \""know-it-all\"" who makes assumptions about the patient that the patient cannot refute because he won't listen. He believes his assumptions are correct and refuses to believe otherwise. His conduct is consistently inappropriate. He is accusatory, derogatory and sexually rude and crude.\n\n He on one occasion told me that I was a \""mental masturbator. \"" On our first meeting he accused me of lying and would not hear otherwise, calling me a \""lost cause.\"" He consistently treated me with gross disrespect and expected me to perfectly comply to his will. I repeatedly told him that I was making great progress with his requests, but that change was difficult due to dealing with the death of my mother and brother, caring for a chronically ill son, and dealing with the consequent bereavement issues.\n\n I was unable to loose the weight he demanded I loose and so he belittled me, told me that I was \""suicidal,\"" and unwilling do anything about it.  I weigh less than 200 pounds. I told him that if all it took to loose weight was for a man to tell me I needed to, I would have been thin a decade ago. He glared at me and said I needed therapy. He belittled me throughout that appointment. When I got home I filled out a form that his office sends to all patients and I noted that I was not motivated by derogatory remarks and a negative attitude. So today he erupted at me and blamed me for his inability to function as a doctor. \n\nIf you are a compliant little old man who looks to your doctor as God, believes it's OK to be belittled and never expresses personal feelings or opinions then perhaps Dr. Mason could successfully push you into your grave. \n\nThe crazy thing is, he thinks he is a great doctor - only if you have no health problems and don't require anything from him. He is completely intolerant of people with disabilities, women with opinions, and anyone who doesn't idolize him."
3,"Stripsteak is AMAZING.  We got a $50 gift card from restaurants.com (for 25 bucks) and when we got there we got the prix fix menu.  When we sat down, they give you a complimentary trio of duck fat fries with 3 different dipping sauces...ok these were DELISH...probably the best french fries I've ever eaten.  Then I chose to get the salad---which was fresh and good---my bf got the crab soup....very good (the crab taste is very subtle and not overwhelming).  Then the steaks came out...it was cooked to perfection and seasoned to perfection.  The steaks were pretty large compared to other steakhouses I've been to----Ruth Chris, Flemings, Mortons, Houstons.  The sides come in small dishes (we got the truffle mac and cheese and broccoli)...delish!  The sides are very small...but very good.  The service was slow...but hey, we were in Vegas....not in a huge rush to get anywhere.  The decor is nice and modern and sleek.  Stainless steel everything.  This place is expensive-----so I recommend going to Restaurants.com and getting the coupon first."
3,"Although I ended up not using A la Crate for my wedding reception due to some venue restrictions (we had to change our reception venue from our original plan and it through some things off), I had a great experience working with Sarah. The day I visited the shop she was incredibly helpful and skillfully worked with myself and another customer at the same time without making either of us feel ignored. She gave me a great no-pressure quote and when I touched base with her she was so kind and helpful again. \n\nI *wish* I could've gotten the rentals I had drooled over from A la Crate, but I'm sure that other brides and party planners will be enjoying their wares for a long time. Having dealt with a number of other \""traditional\"" rental companies in the meantime, A la Crate is top notch! (4 stars and not 5 just as I can't evaluate the whole rental experience)."
0,"The food is always very good, but can I take my last bite before the waiter takes my plate away without even asking me if I am done? He did that with my appetizer, bread AND my salad. I don't appreciate being rushed and disregarded and will happily go somewhere else. I do love Mastro's CH, but there are plenty of great restaurants in PHX!"
3,"Chipotle has the best burritos in town!  Seriously, much better than Qdoba's, Moe's, Salsarita's, et al (I don't include Phat Burrito in this, that's a whole separate category).  Offer great portions and I highly recommend the steak burrito.  Just remember to use some Chipotlaway once you're finished!!"
1,How does one forget noodles in a noodle soup order.. & be kind of rude about it to a customer..\n\nI shall say no more. The food was decent which is why I gave it 2 stars. Don't recommend coming here lol. Not worth the wait.
4,Happy hour was great! Good appetizers! Had the bbq chicken flatbread! Can't complain! Good atmosphere for after work drinks...have the games on so all I have to do is enjoy my Sam Adams and sir back! I would def come back!
3,"Das Pierod ist eine klasse Eisdiele. Es gibt sehr viele Eissorten, von denen alle die ich bisher probiert habe sehr schmackhaft sind. Auch die Eisbecher sind echt klasse, jedoch oft 60/40 Fruchtbecher. Trotzdem muss ich etwas n\u00f6rgeln, der Bolle Eis wie man hier so sch\u00f6n sagt kostet 80 Cent und ist relativ klein. Da ist finde ich noch Luft nach unten, daher muss ich leider einen Stern abziehen."
1,"I was not happy when after i paid for my families meal to find not attended to buffet. The place sprung a major leak in the dinning area during the storm last night. The food, the nacho cheese was more water then cheese & the fruit had sat out far to long that it smelled & tasted funny.... Not to mention the salad was NO way fresh. \nOn the up side the customer service was great."
0,"Wow, this restaurant has the worst customer service! Came in for lunch around 11:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were a party of two and The \""host\"" told us it would be a minute or so, then another party of two comes in and he goes to seat them right away... It wasn't until I spoke up that he then sat us first. Then to make a really long bad experience short, we waited over an hour for appetizers and then was overcharged! When I pointed it out to the \""waitress/bartender\"" she first tried saying its because I got a filling in my taquitos! Really? Because the menu states choice of filling for $6.89, she then said its a glitch in the register system! Whatever, I'll stick with Viva Mercados!"
4,Great place for a family lunch/dinner...fast and friendly customer service..thin crust pizza just the way i like it...huge fan of their pasta made to the order and not just microwaved like most pizza places do...ill definitely come back again and reccomend to all of my friends!! 5 stars for sure!!
3,"This is my second favorite dumpling place, it's not that the dumplings aren't as good as Qing Hua but I live closer to it so it gets extra points for proximity. \n\nMai Xiang Yuan has great dumpling, not to mention the variety. I guaranty that they'll have something for every one from plain Jane pork to my favorite Oyster and pickled cabbage. In my opinion the best way to enjoy this kind of restaurant is with a group of friends so you can each get a different type of dumplings and share them, but if you're on your own you can always get them to give you two kind of dumpling per basket.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the service other then it's like most places in Chinatown quick and efficient but without much conversation.  I memory serves me correctly they close early as well, so if you have a craving for dumpling past 9 pm you might be out of luck.\n\nThis is a small place with only a dozen or so tables and what feels like hundreds of waving cats. If you plan on heading over with a group it might be a good idea to call ahead and make a reservation. If you're in or around Chinatown you might want to stop in and enjoy some of the best dumplings in the city while being watched by waving cats."
4,"ver afraid of the hole in the wall Mexican restaurants? Afraid of the taco runs? Well, fear no more! In various areas of Vegas lies a hole in the wall place called Roberto's taco shop. It's small, the waiters hardly speak English, and the kitchen is spotless.\n\nMy friends, Sheila and Kim, went to grab a few tacos for lunch. I haven't tried Mexican food since arriving to Vegas in fear of the terrible stomach pains legendary of cheap taco places. I decided to take the jump and ordered some need tacos and nachos with cheese. Being na\u00efve, I expected taco bell portions. To my surprise, I was wrong.\n\nRoberto's is a great place to grab authentic Mexican food. Shredded need or chicken in a freshly fried homemade taco shell and killer salsa verde, it was the best I've ever had since guam. Their nachos have fresh cheese melted on them, and the portions are huge.\n\nTake time to visit the small places. Like Roberto's' you'l find amazing places to eat. I give them my personal 5 out of 5 stars.\nSent via BlackBerry by AT&T"
3,"There are some days, when I just refuse to waste precious calories on anything that is not a beautiful dessert - I'm not ashamed to say, I spent my trek through the desert in anticipation of the promised land's Payard sweets!\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the Vegas pilgrimage (and life in general) is the promise of yummy food and unique places to eat. Over the past year - I've tried a better part of all their pastries, and Payard's desserts have yet to disappoint me.\n\nIf you have enough self-control to try only one of there beauties, - the Strawberry Napoleon is a crisp, creamy and light slice of marvelous. \n\nGeorge V for chocoholics & true fatties."
3,"This orangetheory just opened up about two weeks ago in Scottsdale! They were offering a free introductory class and were very accomodating to get me in and have me try it out. The employees were super sweet and welcoming. The facility was clean and had nice restrooms.\n\nThe class itself was great. It is a sixty minute class that focuses on HIIT cardio for 30 minutes and weight training the other 30. While although the workouts are something I can do at my own gym, I felt like the class setting gave me a boost of energy and motivation. What really sets them apart from other training facilities is that they provide a heart monitor that tracks your heart rate and calculates the calories burned. This is extremely beneficial and also plays a roll in making sure you get the most out of those sixty minutes. \n\nAfter the first class I was unsure about joining, but due to a TINY/MINOR hicup in the registration process for my free class- they kind enough to give me a FREE six month membership. The employees and owners are so sweet and you can tell they care about their clients and the results they get.\n\nI will be renewing my membership even after the free six months. Thanks!"
2,"We went to SMG last night to watch Gravity 3D. I really love this location and the concept of a movie theater and bar/grill combined together. The inside is very nice and welcoming. The prices aren't really that bad (plus, we had a Groupon!). \n\nWe both ordered a beer (it was $3 for domestic draft.....which for some reason is only Bud Light and Coors Light. Amp up your domestics!) and split the pepperoni pizza. The pizza came out waaaaaaaay before the beers did. After like 25 min or so we finally got our beers. The beer and pizza were both good. No complaints. \n\nI guess my biggest struggle with this place is that they could just do some little changes and go from a \""just ok\"" place to an \""amazing\"" place. For example:\n-Have a better ordering/distribution system. I have zero clue why a cooked pizza would take longer to bring out than a draft beer. \n-All the waiters and waitresses keep walking by you throughout the whole entire movie.....once the movie starts, lessening the people that walk around would be nice.\n-Bringing out the checks closer to the end of the movie. They bring out your checks like right at the climax of the movie....which is like 45 min-hour before it is even over. I mean I bet there are a ton of people who would have ordered another drink, if they would have just waited to bring out the bills towards to end. It was super distracting. \n-A can of paint to the ladies bathroom walls. In the end, I am not a person who cares about this, but figured it was worth noting for the ladies that did care. The bathrooms doors are all scribbled with \""LT loves ES\"" and \""Christy Rocks\"" (ok so maybe not those exact names but you get the point). Just a can of paint would make this \""problem\"" go away\n\nLike I said, none of these above \""issues\"" make or break a place for me. They are just such small things that they could fix to make this place an amazing experience. The dining/bar area is so nice and upscale feel. Why not make the movie watching experience the same thing?"
2,"State Street* has a here-today, gone-tomorrow feel about it.  I've lived in Madison for slightly over two years and not many of businesses from my first visit are left.  Yummy Buffet, the Russian Dumpling place, Real Chili, Fuddrucker's, a couple of small ladies' clothing stores (sorry, don't go in them), etc.  The list of new arrivals is equally long.  D.P. Dough, American Outfitters, The Love Shack, The Crab House.  For a college town, Madison is devoid of local institutions.\n\nNick's is not one of these fly-by-night operations.  It feels like it's been around for a while, and it's true - Nick's has been open since the 70's, I hear.  The floor is old, the wooden paneling is old, the booths are worn: much more New York or Chicago than Madison.  It's one of these places where you fully expect to pay cash only at an old fashion register - you know, one that looks like an over-sized type-writer.  Zero concessions to modern business models.  \n\nWhat is surprising is the mediocrity of the place.  How has it stayed, when everything else just goes?  I've had hamburgers at Nick's, Club Sandwiches at Nick's, Liver and Onions at Nick's, Grilled Cheese at Nick's, and it's always a disappointing, soggy, indifferently prepared meal.  Or does everyone not agree?  \n\nSomeone, please explain Nick's to me.  Is it the pie?  \n\n*For non-locals, State Street is a pedestrian mall that connects the Capitol to the University of Wisconsin Campus.  It's only a few blocks long, but it feels like a major commercial and cultural thoroughfare.  That should tell you something about Wisconsin."
4,This was a great show. I have always wanted to see them. I have seen them on TV a few times but never in person. I was coming to Vegas with my beautiful girlfriend and when we talked about going to see a show I suggested this one and she said yes let's go.\nWhat a good choice. I like the jazz duo that open the show. They are very good. Mike Jones is an amazing piano player. I think it is funny how most of the audience didn't seem to realize who was playing the stand up bass. Right at the start they have a bulletin border with an envelope posted on it and an empty wooden box on stage. They ask that you go on stage and check out the box and sign the envelope. I thought that was pretty cool. I also like the fact the my awesome girlfriend got us seats right down front. You really can see a lot more when you are upfront. They were great seats.\nI really liked the fact that it wasn't this big fancy magic show with laser lights and smoke and all of the stuff. It was simple and about the tricks not some crazy flashy stage show. They do some great illusions and slight of hand tricks. A few times you think they are explaining the trick to you but they are still tricking you.\nI don't want to give too much away but trust me it was a great show and I would go back to see it again. They are very entertaining. Very funny.\nIt is also great that they both go out to the lobby right after the show to take pictures with everyone. They are very nice and get to everyone. Just be patient and wait your turn. They won't run away. They will get to everybody.\nThis really is one of the best shows in Vegas and it is no surprise that they have been there for 13 years and counting.
0,"This review is for the pet hotel -\n\nWe left our dog here Friday 7/18/14 and picked him up on Sunday 7/20....\n\nAce has stayed at the petsmart hotel off Rainbow and we never had any problems. When we pick him up from that location, he is always so excited to see us that he won't stop jumping and acting crazy.\n\nToday when we picked up Ace, we noticed a change in his behavior (He didn't jump and seemed scared). He also got scared when we went to pet him. \n\nThe biggest and most upsetting thing we noticed was that his left eye was REALLY red. I asked the lady at the front why that was and she told me the dogs have choke collars when they are on the leash that choke whenever the dog pulls on the leash. I told her that her suggestion didn't make sense because only ONE eye was really red. She gave me her card and told me to give her a call after he sees the vet. Ok....... \nSo now we are at home. \n\n3 hours have passed and his eye is getting worse! He seems to have an infection and his eye is swollen with discharge. \n\nIF this is an \""allergy\"" how she also suggested, I will be back tomorrow after our doctors visit and fix my review. Until then, I will never be back here again!"
1,"If you wait an hour to get seated, the food and service better be good.  Well the service was pretty poor.  At least the food was good once we all got it.  Also we were there for a birthday and the waitress knew it, but did noting special for it.  However she blew us off when we needed something to go and sing at another table."
0,"I have held off writing a review for Moto for a year or so.  Sadly I have been subject to dining here multiple times, because I am sucker for 'second chances...and third and fourth'...\n\nMoto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.  \n\nThe service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy. \n\nThe bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything \""sanitary\"" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.\n\nThe food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.  \n\nThe ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.\n\nTwice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s.... \n\nPlease, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself."
1,Mediocre service and equally unremarkable sandwich.
3,"My deep-rooted dislike of LV Strip nightclubs may have finally found its cure....\n\nDrai's Nightclub is seriously doing something right.  The music is phenomenal, as is the sound system and the incredible light-show/special effects. It's definitely an \""experience\"". The dance floor, while sticky from spilled drinks and crowded, is still a fun place to jam/dance around. The decor is lovely, and the dancers were pretty hott. The crowd the night I came was great...lots of bachelor/ette parties, but also just a lot of fun-loving people. The bar set-up was well organized and wait time for drinks was surprisingly short considering the amount of people here.  It definitely helped that the outdoor pool area/sitting area was open and while the club was totally \""poppin'\"", you could find a place to catch your breath between dances. The view of the Strip  at night is awesome!\n\nService was fantastic. Shout-out to bartender Ronaldo for being awesome and making some great drinks :) \n\nNow, if they opened like a \""nighttime pool party\"" here, this would totally be a 5 star review!! Just imagine....you're having a blast dancing around on the dance floor and getting all sweaty, then you can just go ahead and jump into the pool to cool off, or dance around in the water...that would be so perfect for a hot summer night in LV! \n\nBeware, they really like to use the strobe lights, so if you are prone to seizures or photophobia, this might not be your place...."
2,"Beautiful! Not the usual buffet. Great cheese plates and cold cuts but the hot food wasn't special. Tasty, but don't build it up in your head."
1,"Unfortunately I cant relate to the people who had a good time here, which I really blame the music and the overall vibe. After paying the $40 cover, I walked in excited because I had never been here before. Once I walked in I loved the decor, and the setup was pretty nice as well. After about 30 minutes I really wanted to get a vibe going but all they were playing was techno, and house which I despise, and half my music collection in instrumental music (all different crazy weird types). However this wasnt working for me, fast forward to 6 hours later they finally started to change up the music outside. It was douchebag central inside. They starting to play some hiphop around 4am, and all of a sudden boom Danzig  \""mother\"" comes on. I screaming the lyrics at the top of my lungs and while I looking around I noticed that peoples faces look like you put needles in their eyes haha. It was classic, and thats actually why I gave this place the extra star.\n\nI also saw brittany star from rock fo love and charm school there."
4,Delicious good and fantastic service! Great way to start off a trip to Vegas. Michel is one of the best waiters we've ever had!!
1,"I am in agreement with Anna G. below.  The menu is extensive but our choices for the day were very limited as Chef Sara \""did not have this\"" or \"" was out of that\"".  It is also way overpriced by about 30 percent I feel.  I took a friend there who is vegan as a way to be thoughtful but she opted not to have anything because of the price and limited availability of menu items.  I settled on a 9 dollar bowl of carrot soup and a jasimine tea. The soup was actually very tasty but I inhaled it and we left.  I am also suprised the cafe has survived given it's hidden locale off Cave Creek Road."
1,"Came here for breakfast at 8:30am, which, in my books, is way too early to go out to a restaurant. But as I had a 1.5 hour-long class at 10am that I couldn't possibly miss and my best friend was only free in the morning, I dragged myself out of bed with the most enthusiasm I could muster in my sleepy state. \n\nI saw only one waitress and one chef at that time. My best friend got there before me and we chatted for a very long time but strangely the waitress hadn't come yet to take our orders. All the more strange as there were only 3 tables occupied including ours. It was only when I made it obvious that I was glancing at her that she came by to take our orders. Alright-y...\n\nI took a cappuccino and an oriental focaccia. Inside of the focaccia there were grilled peppers, broccoli, and uncooked shrimp. One thing that bothered me about the coffee was that it had so much foam on the top. A little is fine, but this was like a heaping 1/4 cup of foam. Anyway, once that was gone, the coffee wasn't actually so bad. The focaccia was the best portion of my meal there. SO good!\n\nI was hoping for a larger variety of coffee, taking into account that the place starts with \""cafe\"". \n\nSo end of story, waitress was pleasant-looking but not attentive, the coffee was meh-average, and the sandwich was great."
3,"Since I live in Tempe, I attempt to find good places to grab quick noshes that are NOT chain or fast food joints. One of my favs is Ted's or a dog, white hot, or polish. \n\nAll of them great fresh charbroiled and smothered in Teds famous chili sauce, onions and mustard. The onion rings and corn dogs are winners too.\n\nOne recommendation to a first timer. Take cash and do not go at lunch. Really packed with long lines at lunch. My only other knock is the weak soft drink selection.\n\nTed's is so good that Z's Chicago dog opened across the street and lasted all of three months as nobody went. If  Z's opened in any hood in town they would've rocked but not against Ted's of Buffalo."
2,"Food was decent.  Not incredible, but decent.  We were there for eats during a bachelor party week.  It took four times to request doing something cool for the bachelors.  They were supposed to do a bar top dance and pour tequila into their mouths but instead got watermelon shots that were supposedly on the house.  Overall we were looking for something cooler but it was  adequate.  I'd relate it to the hard rock.  Cool atmosphere with potential but only moderate tasting food with average service."
0,"I would choose zero stars if that was an option! We have been with godaddy for 6 years and have always had great service, but in the last year that has gone completely down the toilet. They have totally screwed us over on our website by telling us that it was necessary for us to upgrade from the version 6 to the version 7, but they don't warn you about all the problems you'll experience or that you can be de-indexed by google because there's no actual transferring of info or keywords or anything. It's like completely starting over! Don't do it to yourself! And when we called and asked for help they told us that they no longer offer help like that, instead just go through the tutorials. That's okay, we are switching to another company that has been very helpful in working with us on a new & much improved website. The reason for the switch is that this company has the same great customer service that godaddy once had. Godaddy has forgotten that it is all of the little people that got them to be the big company they are today."
1,"Went here with a couple of business associates for dinner. \n\nWhile the wait staff was 18ish, flirty, and gorgeous, the food service was very slow. On a Monday night with place about 25% full, it took over thirty minutes for three burgers to arrive.\n\nI ordered the Kobe beef burger. It's $40 - for just a burger. If I'm paying that much for a burger, I want it RARE!! I want to taste what I'm paying for: Kobe beef.\n\nWhen ordering I asked for Rare. The response: \""I'm sorry sir, we serve them all the same way.\"" \n\nAh, good! I thought. A proprietor who insists the burgers are cooked properly. I assumed it would be rare as that is universally recognized by most any foodie as most delicious.\n\nWhat she didn't say was \""all the same way\"" meant EVERYTHING IS WELL DONE!!!  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!\n\nWhat a crying shame. To take delicious Kobe beef, grind it for a burger and cook it until it's a dried out hockey puck.\n\nKobe Beef is bred for the FAT! The beef are massaged by hand and fed beer daily to increase the FAT. When the beef is cooked, the reason it tastes so good is because of the marbled FAT.\n\nCooking Kobe beef well done melts all the fat, which makes it taste like supermarket chuck. There is no difference. This is a crime and I am dismayed - to put it mildly.\n\nFor a well done burger, it was passable, but I hate well done. I don't know if it's a Canadian thing. The Canadian we were with flipped when I said I liked rare - going on about e. coli bacteria risk. \n\nEscherichia coli (e. coli) is a fancy word for shit. In mass beef processing plants which make ground beef by the ton, it occasionally happens that a (filled) cow intestine gets sucked in the machine and shit gets all over meat - e. coli galore.\n\nBut - if it's really Kobe beef, that means it's ground in the restaurant kitchen from Kobe beef steak. \n\nThat means there is little chance of cow shit getting in the mix.\n\nFor $40 and Kobe beef, I damn well expect a restaurant to be confident cow shit won't get in their meat and can cook it to order - rather than playing it safe and sterilizing my burger.\n\nFucktards."
3,"Have eaten here quite a few times now and have to say that so far this is my favourite Sushi Restraurant.....the food is consistently good, nice drink selection, wait staff are always happy, helpful and friendly...the atmosphere is relaxed and they usually have some good music playing. It may have just been the times I have been there...but it seems to be a bit dressier than other Sushi places....I have always been casual though and no one seems to be offended! lol"
1,"2 stars for the prices only\nWinco clientele, based on my visit:\nFat people on scooters\nPeople with no teeth or missing front teeth\nPeople with no manners\nPeople with lots of kids\nPeople with very little money\nPeople using EBT cards like crazy\n\nI will try again, but not sure it is worth the trip for lower prices based on the experience."
0,"Well , glad I am not alone!  Made a deal via phone and text ( in writing) told them I am using my credit union and they said no problem. Went to pick up the car and they asked if it was okay if they try and beat my credit union rate and I said sure( dumb of me) they came back with a rate 3 times higher and said they can't honor their written price  since they are loosing money at that price . Manager said the salesman didn't have the authority to give me that price or those terms. Just stay away !"
0,"Just checked in. From the outside, this is a beautiful looking facility.  The foyer is beautiful and looks great.  Bathrooms in the lobby were good, not as clean as most hotels, but it will do after a long drive.  \n\nCheck In - Got ignored and had to wait about 5 minutes.  I thought maybe I got in the wrong line, as Stephanie, one of the manager did not indicate that she would come back to assist me.  Should have been my first clue.  \n\nRoom - \nYou know how you get that disclaimer about non smoking rooms and if you smoke, then you get fined, etc.  So 14th floor, room 150, it smells like smoke.  BIG TIME.  What can they do after a long drive and a group of over 10 plus rooms booked?  Send us to another floor or on the same floor without a view or move us out tomorrow night.  Really, after a long drive and just wanting to settle in, I have to do that all over again?? What a waste of time!!! Not really an option!!  \n\nGroup Room Rate/Booking - \nThe reason we are all here is for a family event, we all want to be on the same floor (which they failed to do) as 2 on 9th floor, 2 on the 12th floor, 4 on the 14th, etc.  Really???  Couldn't even get the request to be on the same floor. Second clue.  \n\nMike our bell hop was great.  Tried to accommodate us and gave us suggestions.  Now that is a great employee who knows how to protect the company he works for.  Can't say the same for the front desk and Stephanie, the manager??  Maybe she needs to go back and get additional training.\n\nMy brother's room, 14-148, although not smoky,  his air condition is not working.  It's a 109 degrees outside.\n\nI will continue to update this review as I have not had the opportunity to hit the pool just yet.  \n\nMy sister loves this place. Not sure why.  It's like 40 minutes from the strip, and room rates are doubled in comparison to Mandalay Bay, MGM, just to name a few."
1,"Pretty decor, great food presentation, food is average, price is REDICULOUSE for that kind of quality. I like it that this resteraunt tries to be your above average eatery, however, the taste of the food is just plain...nothing memorable. The actual location is very hidden as well. The staff there is friendly however this doesn't make up for the average food fare."
2,Average hotel bar. Stopped by with a couple friends on the way back to the hotel.
3,Lettuce wraps rule! Other than that pretty average. Nothing super spectacular. Good tastey food and average prices.
1,"Went there after realizing that Brugo's was not open as advertised. I liked, just liked the food,but the service is terrible! We were a party do 4 that went in for dinner at about 415. There were only about 5 people in the place so when we entered we were quickly greeted and sat down and were the only party at the dining area. \nWater was poured quickly and we were told our server would be with us soon. So after at least 10 minutes and not seeing anyone but the hostesses, bus staff and bartender,who all were engrossed in television at the bar, I went to FIND A SERVER. She arrived and seemed a bit perturbed and argumentative but took our orders. The food arrived quickly and was just ok, but very overpriced for the servings.\nProbably won't be going back here, there are too many great restaurants in the area with great service."
1,"Ok as far as it goes but there are better pubs around. The only true hand pulled ale on was Deuchars - which is OK - but why do they ruin a classic like Harviestoun Bitter and Twisted but cooling it and pushing it through a keg tap????? One barmaid was brilliant, another didnt seem too keen on my english currency but was quick enough to snatch it out of my hand.\nI  will look in again but it won't be my number one choice of pub in Auld Reekie."
4,I see Eve here. I have extremely thick long hair and cut it about twice a year since I am extremely paranoid of cutting! (had a bowl cut for the better part of my childhood).\nMy hair is my best asset so I'm ALWAYS weary of cutting. I saw Eve.. I was floored! I LOVED my cut! it's been 4 months since i cut it... and it's growing out beautifully. \nthe salon is fabulous and they sell the cutest jewlry. \nwould def recommend and continue driving 15 miles to see Eve again.
1,"Ok,  I hate to pile on to this place.  It has SOOO MUCH potential and the whole area wants them to succeed!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside and out and the concept seems like it would be a lot of fun but.... It's not.  \n\nThe service is slow and seems confused.  They food is well.. just blah.  I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  \n\nOk so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with \""True Food\"" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.) Finally, if you want it to be a neighborhood hang give us a GREAT Happy Hour! Good drink and appetizer specials and a cheap kick-butt Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's on the weekends.  I really hope you guys get it together because you could be a lot of fun!\n\nOh and fix your water in the bathroom hot is always on the left!"
3,"I was in Charlotte for business and wanted sushi for dinner.  Cowfish kept coming up in the recommendations but I'm not into fusion restaurants. But after several searches -- all recommending Cowfish, I read a review.  The first sentence said \""people will be skeptical...\""  ha!\n\nIt was great! We sat at the bar (which serves the full menu).  We ordered saki samplers, tuna nachos and a sashimi platter, all delicious.  We ordered a specialty roll and the sliders to share.  It was the perfect amount of food, the prices were reasonable and everything tasted great.  I highly recommend for a fun night out."
1,"Very expensive, but convenient... because this is the only place to get anything in Vdara."
3,"Came here with my SO and our friend that was visiting. I have never been here although I live just around the block, so we decided to finally try it. We came on a game day so it was packed at the bar area and around it. We did have to wait a bit to get seated because it was the dinner rush, but once we did our waitress was very courteous. I can't remember specifically which burger I ordered for the life of me, but it came with a creamy sauce that was to die for. My SO ordered a bacon burger and both of them were great, no complaints here. The only downside is that the food took a while to come out and I had finished more than half my drink by the time it arrived. Our waitress was also rushing around so much that I never got a drink refill until I was done with my burger."
4,"Timeless Tattoo continues to set the standard for tattoo shops and artists for me. \n\nA little while back (I can't believe I didn't write this sooner) I went in to see Das Frank for another custom piece:  A butterfly with a little bit of Celtic knot work in the wings. \n\nWhen I arrived, he was finishing the stencil for me, and let me tell you...this was so much more beautiful than I had envisioned!\n\nFrank took a little artistic liberty, and rather than doing a butterfly, he did a moth, which ended up being perfect, as I also asked for a hidden skull, and I just love it.  Everyone gets butterflies...I have a death's head moth!  Besides, they both symbolize metamorphosis, which is what I wanted.\n\nThe knot work is astounding.  Its so complex, and intricate!\n\nThe line work took about an hour and a half, and I still have to make an appointment to get it colored and shaded, but as it is right now, I'm SO pleased with Frank's work.  \n\nTimeless is highly recommended, as is Das Frank."
2,"Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? \n\nDid I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?\n\nI'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.\n\nKeane: So.. uh... what are you into?\nGirl: *surprised look*\nKeane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.\nGirl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?\nKeane: ... shampoo.\n\n*examines my shirt*\n\nGirl: What is \""Yelp\""?\n\nAw, shit. Now it's on..."
3,"Love the fact that the King of Mammals is the Lion. Fantastically able to view these beautiful animals in an African-type surrounding encased in acrylic glass enclosure, is a one-of-a-kind habitat in MGM Grand Resort & Casino. \n\n\""MGM\"" stands for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is the most powerful movie production studio in Hollywood since 1915 that produces major motion pictures, have vast studio sets and very famous top-grossing movie stars. Its films open with a roaring lion which is known as Leo, the Lion. As MGM's trademark, it is fitting that the MGM Grand Resort in Vegas houses these beautiful lions for public viewing. \n\nOn its hotel frontage is the largest gleaming bronze cast statue of the mighty King of the Beasts looking out over the Las Vegas Boulevard called \""The Strip\"" by the corner of East Tropicana Avenue. It stands out at this very corner for all to see. But the beauty of these amazing animal can be appreciated and photographed in the hotel's central enclave, at the Lion Habitat.\n\nWatch them as they play, walk around, listen to their growl, do some play with their trainers and simply just lazing around on their bellies or sometimes as they lay asleep. Photography is allowed. A walk-thru tunnel can bring you much closer to these beauties. This habitat is great for all ages and people from all walks of life. I have seen lions while living in Africa in my teenage years. African nights are common with lions' growls heard from the distance, or sometime seen crossing the \""bush\"" road. I have always been captivated by their beauty. At this Lion Habitat, everyone can \""oooh\"" and \""aaah\"" without the fear of its wild instincts. Belonging to the cat family but larger and wild, Lions are completely amazing and fantastic to behold."
2,"The first time I came in here, it was to make use of the take away services that this place has - as I waited for my paninni and crepe for me and my girlfriend (she lived just down the road from here), I sat at a table. Only to be moved quite agressivly by the owner of the cafe. Now I would have understood if the place was packed and there was a bunch of old women coming in who might die if they didnt sit down, but the cafe was empty bar me. Still, he made me stand in the corner until I had my food. Hmm. And now I know this seems to be a regular thing, its happened to me more than once and various other stories reveal no more compasion to others.\n\nIts quite a testiment at how good this place is then that I still give it a good star rating. The food is great, and apart from the owner the service is good too. I do recommend it - just avoid the owner."
3,just about the only place to get coffee on Mill.
2,"This place has SO much potential. It's just not quite there yet. I am so excited that a boutique style hotel is on Fremont, and emphasizes on the \""old vegas\"" feel. The lobby and casino are small, but really really cool. The dealers look retro and the dancing girls make the atmosphere really fun. However, the room was not really what I would call \""ready\"" for guests. They are tiny, but it's an old hotel so that can be expected. But the bathrooms are dated to the point of shocking, when you are not expecting a hostel feel in vegas. With the right products and designer snacks (similar to the Ace Hotel) this place could be a really fun alternative to the usual mega casinos."
